autointent.Hasher
=================

.. py:class:: autointent.Hasher

   A class that provides methods for hashing data using xxhash.

   This class supports both a class-level method for generating hashes from
   any given value, as well as an instance-level method for progressively
   updating a hash state with new values.


   .. py:method:: hash(value)
      :classmethod:


      Generate a hash for the given value using xxhash.

      :param value: The value to be hashed. This can be any Python object.

      :return: The resulting hash digest as a hexadecimal string.



   .. py:method:: update(value)

      Update the internal hash state with the provided value.

      This method will first hash the type of the value, then hash the value
      itself, and update the internal state accordingly.

      :param value: The value to update the hash state with.



   .. py:method:: hexdigest()

      Return the current hash digest as a hexadecimal string.

      This method should be called after one or more `update` calls to get
      the final hash result.

      :return: The resulting hash digest as a hexadecimal string.



   .. py:method:: intdigest()

      Return the current hash digest as an integer.

      This method should be called after one or more `update` calls to get
      the final hash result.

      :return: The resulting hash digest as an integer.
