autointent.metrics.retrieval.retrieval_ndcg
===========================================

.. py:function:: autointent.metrics.retrieval.retrieval_ndcg(query_labels, candidates_labels, k = None)

   Calculate the Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) at position k.

   NDCG at position :math:`k` is calculated as:

   .. math::

       \text{NDCG@k} = \frac{\text{DCG@k}}{\text{IDCG@k}}

   where:
   - :math:`\text{DCG@k}` is the Discounted Cumulative Gain at position :math:`k`,
   - :math:`\text{IDCG@k}` is the Ideal Discounted Cumulative Gain at position :math:`k`.

   The NDCG value is normalized such that it is between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates the ideal ranking.

   :param query_labels: For each query, this list contains its class labels
   :param candidates_labels: For each query, these lists contain class labels of items ranked by a retrieval model
    (from most to least relevant)
   :param k: Number of top items to consider for each query
   :return: Score of the retrieval metric
