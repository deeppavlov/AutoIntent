autointent.metrics.decision_roc_auc
===================================

.. py:function:: autointent.metrics.decision_roc_auc(y_true, y_pred)

   Calculate ROC AUC for multiclass and multilabel classification.

   The ROC AUC measures the ability of a model to distinguish between classes.
   It is calculated as the area under the curve of the true positive rate (TPR)
   against the false positive rate (FPR) at various threshold settings.

   :param y_true: True values of labels
   :param y_pred: Predicted values of labels
   :return: Score of the decision ROC AUC
