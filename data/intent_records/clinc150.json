            "We were excited to eat here, it is difficult to find. They were closed at 3 p.m. on a Saturday.",
            "So this is a place, with food. That much cannot be denied. But you know what? It's a small airport restaurant, and if you're flying in for a $100 hamburger, then a $100 hamburger you can have. And patty melts. And salads. And whatever other Sysco-type delights you might expect. (It was even prime rib night when we were there, but as it was 20 minutes til closing time, I thought better of it.)\\n\\nI had a perfectly reasonable patty melt myself, and I enjoyed it. The service was really nice, and the views out the window of the evening traffic on approach were phenomenal. Plus, *tons* of model airplanes hanging from the ceiling in the dining area, which was a fun touch.",
            "Review for the Lounge/Club:\\nEvery time I go to Vegas this is always one of my stops- primarily because of the view. I started going years ago before it was super hyped up and packed almost all the time. I also remember the days when the Witch Doctors were twice the size they are now (and weaker than they used to be!). Voodoo hasn't changed much in the past 5 years except going cheap on the drinks and over packing the club with VIP sections that are unused (which is totally annoying if you're trying to see the view without a bunch of drunk asses running into you). \\n\\nThe DJs are consistently good and it has a very, very mixed crowd. However, I only keep coming back for the view- it doesn't compare to anything else. Ghost Bar has nothing on this place. \\n\\nAlso, over the years the award winning flair bartending has leveled off (I think I saw one bottle throw the whole time we were there) and it's not nearly the show it used to be which is really disappointing. If you ever have a chance to catch the episode of Three Sheets on Spike where Zane goes to Vegas- you'll see what I mean. The show was filmed several years ago and even there you can see the Witch Doctor and the flair are way better than they are now. \\n\\nFor newcomers I think this is a great place to at least see once just because the view is so amazing. However, for those who have been going back over and over again- it's turning into a huge disappointment. \\n\\nFor the Restaurant:\\n\\nI've dined here several times and price-wise it runs about the same as any other high end steak house you'd find on the strip. Mostly we ate here out of convenience since the selection at Rio isn't the greatest for food. The service has been reasonably decent and the food was good however, if dinner is going to cost around $100 a person I want to be wowed. The whole experience didn't seem like a 5 star dining like when we went to Strip House (wow! by the way). The servers were friendly but only slightly knowledgeable about the wine list and it seemed like there wasn't enough coverage for the tables which made dinner take forever. I don't really remember much more than that which is disappointing because I wish it were more memorable for the price paid. Been there, done that- won't be back to Voodoo Steak when there's so many better options for the same price.",
            "I've been going here a lot(pretty much a regular you could say.) It's a good place to include in your bar hopping plans. Wandos too busy? Fooseball taken at Vintage? Swing by Red Shed. It's also one of the few bars you can actually have a conversation at some  nights. One of my minor complaints is the jukebox. If there is no songs playing..it's just that--quiet. And at certain points in the night, you can hear a pin drop. Lines for the bathroom is sometimes annoying and I've felt really bad for the ladies here who have sometimes waited 30 minutes before the line moved one person :P",
            "I went to Sole on the weekend and found that it was so crowded and noisy I thought I would wait till later.  What better night to feed my paella hungrys than tonight when it rained cats and dogs - I was seated immediately and the noise level was bearable.  I ordered a house salad, paella Valenciana, thought I might have a dessert after.  I was served a very small roll with a small piece of very cold, hard butter and waited.  The salad was better than the standard peter rabbit variety of lettuce with a slice of tomato and was not ice cold, certainly a plus.  The paella came in a traditional paella dish with, I kid you not, three small clams, three muscles, a few pieces of squid, and a few shrimp.  The rice had little saffron flavor. The Sofrito  was extremely bland with little of the spices that one associates with this dish.  Basically Sole prepares this \\\"all at once\\\" so the flavors have little or no chance to \\\"marry up\\\" and the sea food being overcooked is rubbery. In other words you must \\\"reserve\\\" the sea food and add it back in at the last moment.  As for the rice it should not be disturbed at the end of cooking so the socarrat (a crispy caramelized rice) can form in the bottom of the pan (See recipe below).  I think if you can buy canned paella and warm it up in a microwave it might be a close approximation of this abomination.  On the way out I was asked  about how I liked my meal.  When I proceeded to explain to him why I was so disappointed he ask first where I had eaten  paella and suggested that next time i should probably eat it some where else.  At no time was I rude to this person and I was frankly astonished at his attitude.  So to all you yelpers I suggest that you too might want to consider trying to find real Spanish food somewhere else.  For my friend at Sole I hope that even though he assures me that never in 8 years has he had a complaint about their  paella he will take the time next time to have the real thing at either of the fine restaurants that I have referenced in NYC.  He might also like to check out this recipe- noting the importance of the socarrat, the Sofrito, and the gradual \\\"building\\\" of the paella\\n\\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/el-charro-espanol-new-york#query:spanish%20food\\n\\nThis restaurant is a treasure and has been  serving a very special crowd for over thirty years.\\n\\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/socarrat-paella-bar-new-york\\nFor those who are not quiet as adventuresome as might be demanded by tiny little el Charro this is one of NY's best Spanish restaurants.\\n\\nhttp://www.paellapans.com/Paella-Recipe-Seafood-a/142.htm\\nThis is close to the paella that I am accustomed to eating at el-Charro's -  note the emphasis on the proper forming of the Socarrat\\n\\nRegardless of all this.  Common courtesy is something that I expect from any restaurant.  This place comes up short on just about every thing.",
            "Went in on a sunday afternoon. Place was dead. Wasn't greeted, sat at a table and was not helped. Waited 10 minutes, still no service. Walked out and still heard nothing from staff. \\n\\nIf time and service are important to you stay away from Hob Nob.",
            "I have lived here in Phoenix for 9 months now and have had a tough time finding a hair salon as I have thick, curly hair. I have been buying groupons for many places trying them out and none have worked. I bought the groupon for The Green Room to try it out and am absolutely in love with them! \\n\\nSteph was my stylist and she was amazing! I came in with a specific color I wanted as I will be leaving for two out of town weddings this month and she consulted the owner to make sure I got the right color. They would not let me leave until my color was perfect (my cut was amazing as well)! Eric (the owner) even took time to blow dry my hair after Stephanie's next client came.\\n\\nI will definitely be going back in the future for cuts and colors. The place was cute and cozy and the staff was super friendly. They definitely made me feel like they cared about me and what I wanted where the other salons just put a color on and let me go. So glad I found them and have found my new salon!",
            "Totally gone down the tube. Way overpriced for food out of a box. Deserts are dry, old and inedible. Meat is like boot leather. The oysters stunk of dead fish. Plus just like the Paradise Buffet at Freemont, they were stuck to the shell. Very old.\\n   Wait staff was as rude as they come. Wanted a 20% gratuity for my party of 8. This is a BUFFET dang it. WE get our OWN FOOD. Then they seated us 4 to a table across the room from each other. The buffet had 15 people in it. They did this out of spite. Stay away.",

            "There were three of us. Atmosphere was great. Menu was confusing on what to share, what to do. Once we studied it, we decided that two of us would share traditional California Roll and Shrimp Tempura Roll sushi to begin. These were very fresh and very good.  It was probably one of the best but not the best we have had. Then, these two would share the Shrimp and Lobster with Spicy Lemon ($38). It was served in a small deep dish skillet with veggies. It was a good size dish actually. I was afraid we were taking a risk to share, but it worked out. It was more pepper than a spicy with the lemon flavor. It was good but not over the top amazing. \\n\\nThe other person ordered miso soup. She liked it fine. She ordered chicken and veggie skewer ($15 ea) and white rice. She liked it well. \\n\\nGlass of wine ranged $15-$19 each. I had the $19 Russian river glass. It was great. Various cocktails looked fun.\\n\\nFinal bill was approx $60 each.",
            "Where to begin...I think I will start with the positive.   The brie brulee topped with the caramelized apple slices was a hit, the mixed green salad with goat cheese was awesome and the pear tart desert was outstanding.  The lamb shank was cooked perfectly, but the lamb flavor was missing.   The whole dish ( lamb shank, veggies, Israeli couscous, figs and apricots) ALL had the exact same flavor; only the textures were different.   Now the flavor was great, but not something I would write home about.   Now to the negative stuff...The place was too crowded and noisy for my liking. The tables were so close that I felt I could join in the conversation next to me without effort. Couple that with REALLY REALLY slow service and, well you get the idea.   You will need to bring your own wine and they will open it for you for only $10.00.  French food without wine?   really??  And then you gaff me for 10 bucks?!?  Needless to say I had the minted tea. It was okay but no real mint flavor to speak of.   The final bill for one appetizer, one salad, one entree and one desert was $70.00. (Not counting the tip)  My date and I split everything and we were comfortably well fed. So, the portion size was decent.   To sum up, it would be a nice place for a date, but I won't be back and I know a place not to far from there that I would MUCH rather go to given the choice.",
            "the food is awesome... but the hostess are not nice....",
            "Got this \\\"deal\\\" on Travel Zoo for $135 - \\\"normally $220.\\\"  A horrible joke.  Supposedly a five course meal.  I think the total weight of items served must have been about 8 ounces.  The carpaccio only covered a quarter of the plate, the \\\"scallops\\\" consisted of a single scallop each!!  The pear for desert was about the size of a small tangerine.  I've never seen a ripe pear that small! They brought out covered plates in order for us not to be shocked until they removed the cover.  Should have asked for a magnifying glass to find the food on the plate.  It was like the Mad Hatter's Tea Party - it was hilarious.  If it wasn't for the bread and butter we would have starved.  Of course drinks are not included.  To add insult to injury you get an additional $35 bill tacked on for service, tip, and tax.  Would have preferred a gourmet meal at MacDonalds.  I almost forgot to mention this place has all the ambiance of a restroom.  No windows - small interior rooms.  There was a private party in the main dining area so they put us in an elevator and put us in what I call the \\\"annex\\\" upstairs with even less ambiance - looked like a converted hallway!  Avoid this scam at all cost!",

It's Matsuri. \\n\\nYeah, the parking rates around heritage square are pretty hefty when a big event like this rolls around. But it's totally worth it. I mean, when and where else in Arizona can you stuff yourself with steamed-right-in-front-of-you nikuman, take photos with samurai, see a kimono fashion show, feel really thankful you're out of high school and no longer as susceptible to the weirdness of cosplay, buy a hapi coat, pet a bunch of shiba-inu, marvel at bonsai trees that are older than your grandmother and watch almost 60 people wail on taiko drums? \\n\\nOK, I'm a little biased about the drums.

And I will not shut up Im going to the news, every review website, write my congress man about this unfair practice. When I moved out the house was 99% perfect. All I missed was LIGHT BULBS. They charged me $70 dollars for 50cent light bulbs. They said everything was good on the phone and then I get the check which was 35% of my deposit.   We gave them slake when they took a year to fix the garage door and then they fix it when we move out. Why couldn't you give us a break?",
            "We recently adopted our dog from my mom-in-law who lives in Casa Grande and I wanted to get Bruno in to see a vet in Tempe. I looked up a few offices and saw this location had an awesome rating. I was pleased to see someone I respect, Shayna K. from Scottsdale Doggie Suites, providing a 5 star rating and that was it. \\n\\nI immediately decided to make a new patient appointment for my furry baby. The office is clean, the staff is nice, and they made Bruno feel right at home. \\n\\nDr. Berthiaume came in and was very informative. I think he could tell I was a nervous \\\"new mom\\\" and he helped me stay at ease. He suggested one medication for Bruno which is for heartworm prevention but didn't pressure me into making a purchase right then and there. He gave me a pamplet on it and told me to do some research on my own first. (AMEN!)\\n\\nWhen I told them about my concern about him scratching his ears a lot, they took swabs but didn't run them. Dr. B. said if he saw anything \\\"bad\\\" he would have ran them for a test but didn't want to charge me for anything Bruno didn't need done. He suggested to have Bruno's stool tested but said we could bring in a sample anytime and they would send it off then. There was NO pressure to have tests done so they could get money out of me. \\n\\nThey genuinely cared about Bruno and my wallet. I will be going back, this is going to be my dog's doctor, and I appreciate how awesome everyone was. It is so refreshing to find a place that really care about the patients they see and the owners.",

            "I wanted to love this place with it's cute decor and giant coffee mugs. We went in on a weekday morning where there was enough staff on for every table to have their own server. After waiting 10 minutes to be greeted by a server that looked mildly annoyed she had an opportunity to make money while at her job... I ordered a coffee, my husband ordered a pineapple juice. The juice never came. We ordered breakfast.. Maybe the juice was being fresh squeezed? My husband ordered pancakes, I ordered the chilaquiles benedict. The pancakes came out like pancakes... The Benedict looked like everything my breakfast loving heart desired. The first bite was cold... I assessed it to be the mass amount of pico piled on top. A few more bites... Meh. Tried the other half without all the pico... ICE COLD meat. Appetite killed with the fear that Id be yacking up food poisoning later. After our server finally showed up.. Still no pineapple juice.... I informed her of the ice cold meat (Cold as if they took it out of the freezer, forgot to prep it and just piled it on top). She asked if I wanted another one. I declined saying I didn't have time to wait for another meal as my husband was already finished with his breakfast and it was a weekday. She said she would take it off the bill. I handed her my credit card to go ahead and run since everything seemed to take forever there. She brings it back... The manager took $5 off. The Benedict was $13.50. The manager also never even came to the table. I want to hate this place and never return, but I know there is so much potential on that menu. The sad part is the owner was sitting at the table next to usgoing over paperwork.... Oh well.",

I'm all for a burger grilled over hot coals, but when that is ALL you taste on a ridiculously overpriced burger with ala carte sides that you have to pay extra for and you leave smelling of burning mesquite, then that doesn't lend me to wanting to return.

She got a vegetarian taco plate and I got a pulled pork taco plate.  \\n\\nMy pulled pork was not what I was expecting, but I thought it was okay.  \\n\\nThe service here was lacking though.  Our waiter brought us chips and salsa even though we said we didn't want any when he asked.  And then he insisted that we had ordered it.  Of course he had to take it back, and we felt a little bad but we could noticeably tell that he was annoyed at us.  \\n\\nHe was overly attentive though.  He kept on filing my glass of water even though the pitcher of water was on the table.  And he kept on coming by to ask us, \\\"do you have everything you need right now?\\\" often interrupting our conversation.  \\n\\nOn the whole I think if you're in the mood for slightly expensive Mexican food (about $15 a plate) then this place is worth checking out.

My experience went quite smoothly however.  I went with four people, after our slightly confused looking hostess found us a seat, we were provided with great service.  The service was intelligent, but in a very scripted manner.  The beer was good, great compared to american craft and decent compared to european breweries.  The building is a lot of fun, huge renovated church with shiny stainless steel fermenting silos covering the side wall and the altar.  I chose the special for the night, which was rib-eye finished in the wood burning oven and a cranberry chutney.  It was good, charred on the outside, not overdone and a good cut of meat to begin with.  The prices are high for what you get though, meaning I wasn't stuffed after my meal.  Main Pro: Good local beer\\nMain Con: The smell of the bar, not the fermentation, was fairly strong.",

The pool area is nice although they can use a little more shade options out there. \\n\\nThis place can feel a little run down from time-to-time in their regular rooms and they definitely need some upgrades.

The hostess was sweet as pie and informed us that they were switching over to their dinner menu. It's quite large, with a mix between Italian and Mediterranean fare, but was not overwhelming in the slightest.\\n\\nTo start, we ordered a hummus appetizer, and it was so incredibly good - served with warm pieces of soft, airy and delicious pieces of pita.

            "For our weekly pizza delivery, we decided to try something new and got Manolo's.\\n\\nWe opted for the largest size thin crust with half pepperoni and half sausage. We also got 3 empanadas for $6 to go with it, delivery time was about an hour, which is to be expected on a weekend. This amount of food was just enough for our group of 3 in terms of portions.\\n\\nThe pizza was decent, definitely better than a Papa John's or similar chain. I didn't think it was anything spectacular though. If you like thin crust, this might be for you. It reminded me of Sbarro, except a little better. My issue with this pizza, and perhaps all thin crust/New York style is the lack of sauce. The sauce is so key to the flavor that often times without it your just eating a cheesy breadstick. I might have liked it more if there was a bit more sauce. The pepperoni wasn't that good, however, the sausage was unusually good, it tasted fresh and wasn't just a mushy piece of nothing, great flavor! I think I will get sausage if I order again. The crust was good, crispy bottom but edible edges.\\n\\nFeedback on the empanadas was a unanimous OK. I can only personally speak for the cheesecake empanada. The filling didn't resemble something you could get at The Cheesecake Factory, but it also wasn't just dried goop. Not too bad! I think the empanadas might be a really good bargain if you got a lot of them and the price was around $1 each.\\n\\nI have not tried any of the specialty pizzas and I may have to do that and then update my review. I will also have to try The Empanadas House for a fair comparison.\\n\\nOverall we thought Manolo's was just OK, we thought it might have been just a little pricey, but we were not disappointed with our food.\\n\\nI'll be back!",

            "In order to not write a hateful review, I had to bring myself to the realization that this place is supposed to be a 'healthy' buffet, not a 'good' buffet. \\nI had never been here before, so I was delighted to see it was indeed a buffet. But as I got halfway down the first island of stuff, the delight turned into trepidation. At the cashier, which is at the end of your first go-round, she said $11.98 and I looked at my plate. \\\"For this?\\\" I wanted to ask. Wisely, I did not, for that is when I saw the other side of the buffet. There were warming lights and an actual kitchen back there, so I figured that must be where the meat is. I paid, however still leery. \\nI sat my salad down and hurried over to the hot stuff. Soups, alright. Breads with cheese on it, cool. Pastas, ok. Meats? No. Crap. \\nSo I knew I'd be eating 'healthy'. I could use more of that. I didn't complain too much. \\nAll the salad stuff was fresh. Whether it was good or not will depend upon your taste in salad stuff. They've got a variety toppings, so you probably will create something to your liking. They seemed to have all the bases covered with the dressings, too...and the low-fat honey mustard dressing doesn't taste too low-fat, so don't avoid it. There's also oils and vinaigrette in bottles. I will say that for a place that specializes in salads, it seemed that they could have had even more toppings to offer...no ham, no turkey, no avocado, no mozzarella, no blahblahblah... I honestly have seen more offerings at a Ruby Tuesday salad bar. \\nAs for the specially prepared salads, most people will find something tasty. I had the Caesar salad, the pineapple coleslaw, tarragon tuna something, and some chicken and rice thing. The best was the Caesar, which was especially fresh and had garlic croutons. The pineapple coleslaw was as refreshing a dish as I think I've ever had. The tuna and the chicken/rice thing was just ok to me...but I still must point out how fresh it all was. \\nThe soups were delicious. I tried the shrimp bisque and the Mexican soup (can't remember the name). The bisque was awesome as I had two bowls of it, creamy with a subtle flavor and plenty of shrimp. The Mexican soup was the meatiest thing there and had a great rustic taste. Neither soup was greasy or too heavy. \\nThe pasta was unremarkable. I had the lemon pasta with capers...all you tasted was a tang of lemon and absolutely nothing else. The pasta was well cooked, but just left you with no taste. I didn't bother with the mac and cheese, as I don't eat that at restaurants. Then there was the broccoli and cheese stuff...had too much of a twang to it, too sharp. I put it over the pasta to try and make something happen, the result was tasting nothing but the twang plus the tang. Uh uh. \\nOne of things I enjoyed the most was the asiago something something bread. It was nice and crusty, but soft somehow. And the taste was great...garlicy and the asiago cheesiness. Perfect with all the salad and even more so to sop up soup. There were other breads, but none looked as appetizing. I must say that they kept it nice and fresh, with at least 3 batches coming out while we were there. \\nDidn't try the yogurt or any of the deserts...should've. Oh well. \\nThere is also some darn good strawberry lemonade here. Its got real strawberries from the looks of it, because you can see the 'seeds' or whatever that stuff is in strawberries, all in the stuff. Either that or my glass was dirty... No, but it was great, and goes well with everything. \\nSomething else I'd like to mention is the service. The special salads had all been depleted, someone notified the cashier, the cashier immediately notified whoever, and they came over right away and began making fresh salads...which shows that there isn't some big vat in the back with premade stuff in it. The line was backing up, but the people making the salads were busting their butts. It was nice to see. \\nWill I go back? Probably not, just not my style of buffet, even though it really SHOULD replace my usual buffets. \\nShould you go? If you like salads a lot, and if you like soups a lot - then yes. Keep in mind that they only had 3 soups to choose from, and also some chili (didn't try). So that might not be enough variety for you. And you only get the pretty basic salad toppings. But its all fresh. Do not go here for the pasta. And I don't know what changes at dinner time, so maybe there's more variety then. \\nGood value? Yes, if you can get full off of salad and soup. Looking for a meal with more girth? No. $12 for no meat for a man who is looking for meat leaves a bad taste in the mouth. Don't know the prices for kids under whatever age, but there is a senior price. \\nIf you're smart enough to eat healthier, this is a decent place, but still doesn't seem to have enough stuff to choose from - that's my biggest gripe. Stay away if you're used to eating at the Chinese buffet.",

            "The skybar itself did not wow me, but I guess it's cool that it's different than the usual bars/clubs in Southside.  The place was small and can get kinda steamy if crowded.  Maybe it's better during the warmer season.  It was colder when my friends and I went, so it was covered.\\n\\nThe pre-made frozen drinks at skybar weren't that great according to my friends.  One had the pina colada, which she said didn't taste anything like pina colada.  Tasted like frozen nasty alcohol.  My other friend had the strawberry daiquiri, which she ended up returning to the bar after 2 sips.  The bartender was nice enough to change it to a better tasting drink that's on the rocks instead of being frozen.  I don't really know whether to recommend this place to a friend, I guess I will if it's their first time.  Otherwise, I probably won't go up to skybar.  Also, they charge an $8 cover.\\n\\nAnyway, we couldn't hear the music, so we decided to go down to Diesel after about 10-15 mins at skybar.  Diesel had more people and definitely more fun than skybar.",

You will see most of the seafood chillin in the tanks when you first walk in, so you know it's at least freshly killed.\\n\\nHowever, like the other reviewers I can't give this more than 2 stars since the place is so filthy.  In all seriousness, the service was friendly but I had to keep kicking a cockroach away with my foot during dinner.\\n\\nHonestly, these guys could dominate the local market for traditional chinese dining if they'd just clean up a little and spend more than five dollars on the interior decor.

            "Ice Pan is an interesting take on an already saturated chilled dessert market. The iced cream is made right in front of you with subtle variations on your classic flavors. This establishment is indeed somewhat pricey, but if you compare it to every other place on the strip, it is a perfectly acceptable amount to pay for a dessert.\\n\\nThe taste is nothing phenomenal, but they way they prepare it kinda is. the ice cream is made right in front of you as they turn milk and fruit into customized ice cream. The cream is poured onto this chilled pan / wok and freezes almost instantly. The ice cream masters then proceed to stir, scrape, slap, and slice the ice cream using knife-like spatulas with such speed and precision that you'd think you were watching a Benihana chef in action. Seriously, if they brought a knife to a gun fight, they would still have a chance at coming out on top.\\n\\nAs for eating the ice cream, the taste was a little light, which is kinda nice after a heavy Las Vegas meal, but deep down, I was kinda hoping for a little more umph from the flavor. Depending on who you get to prepare it, the consistency can be super creamy or hard and dense. If you get a more senior preparer, the cream comes out very smooth and can be almost gelato-like. If your preparer is the young one who has yet to master the tricks of the trade, the cream may be left on the ice pan a bit too long and freeze a little harder than it probably should.\\n\\nWith both ups and downs to this eatery, I think the Yelp rating system hit this one right on the mark, it is A-OK.",

One salsa was way too spicy and the other tasted like tomato sauce. \\n\\nWhen our food arrived (after a good wait) my guacamole had a fowl, spoiled taste and my mom's steak was rare. We sent both plates back (which I never do) and my second plate came equipped with beef instead of the chicken I order. Besides that, the food was just mediocre.

            "The side of sauteed Spinach was incredibly salty otherwise the color was wonderful and it smelled great. The side of sauteed mushrooms looked really good, but they were way too peppery. I never season my food, when its cooked right there isn't any need to but whoever made those dishes had a very heavy hand. I NEVER leave food behind and I didn't even finish half of them. \\n\\nI had to ask for a steak knife. Waited until someone bothered to make eye contact with me to ask for it by the way. The steak was cooked perfectly - rare just the way I like it and the texture wonderful. The thin french fries were great too, very good! Flavor, texture etc. but as I ate the steak there was way too much seasoning on it as well. Seasoning shouldn't over power the flavor of a good cut of meat and this did. \\n\\nThe biggest issue I had: the staff really needs a lesson in professionalism. I heard one woman behind me talk about a female condom which was just PART of their conversation. They were all huddled in the back while there were people at tables on the floor. Totally turned me off. I saw waitress and waiter in disagreement in the middle of the dining area while setting up a table. One couple complained they had been sitting there ignored. The gentleman got up and said something to a waiter and the manager came over and appeared to make amends in a grandiose way.  My own waiter walked by and for some reason never made eye contact. I was not sure why  - to be clear I NEVER give anyone a hard time nor am I anything other than friendly. Even if the service and food are not up to par. \\n\\nI was seated in the back, on the left (if you are facing the kitchens) so had a birds eye view - and ear - to everything. I told one friend that I actually felt like I was in restaurant boss type episode and there was a hidden camera somewhere, it was that ridiculous with the staff and how they were acting. \\n\\nThe Manager must have realized I heard what I shouldn't have heard because he gave me a box of free pastries and apologized. The staff treated him, quite honestly? - like crap. It was embarrassing. The fact that those kids (some of them - others adults) acted in such a manner in a restaurant that I'd heard NOTHING but rave reviews about? It was disappointing. \\n\\nThe fact I heard him trying to discipline them - they ignored him - was probably not smart on his part either. He seemed frazzled and angry and just disgusted. Lets just say the atmosphere that night was a 1 star. If the staff acts up like that? Get them in the kitchen and send them home, don't do it where patrons can hear.\\n\\nIn all fairness maybe (hopefully for the owner) this was not a regular occurrence because friends of mine RAVE about this place. For breakfast and dinner saying it was one of their favorites. I went on a Coupon to try it out, and at first loved the atmosphere but it went downhill from there. I also can't see paying that kind of money for a meal that was \\\"eh\\\" \\n\\nI always eat every bite on my plate and I savor each one. I didn't take anything with me except the free pastries and my french fries. \\n\\nI judge a place on different criteria and I have a sensitive palate and nose. LOVE food. To cook it, eat it, buy it, read about it etc. I think I am a good judge of what I see, taste, smell and - hear.\\n\\nI'd recommend other places before this one for DINNER - may consider giving them a shot for breakfast type fare and will say the ONE WONDERFUL thing - the best thing about this place - the desserts. They were a little stale but it was after 9pm so that isn't a biggie in my book. \\n\\nI bought a slice of Carrot cake and Tiramisu - the waiter had closed my bill without asking me about desserts at all by the way......I watched a waitress across the room RAVE about them to a full table of people ( I was solo) and she had me craving them. He was going to give them to me for free because he closed the bill out. I insisted on paying for them and will tell you that it was \\\"THE BEST\\\" carrot cake I've ever had! I'd order a whole one for my birthday cake if I could. \\n\\nThe free pastries the Manager gave me? Macaroons are awesome almond cakes too and croissants with chocolate in them. I would recommend this place as a BAKERY and I may give them a shot - after hearing a friend say the crepes were really good - for breakfast. However, not my first choice or even second for Dinner. \\n\\nFor the owner? You have your work cut out for you, I am not a professional in the food service industry but you should consider \\\"Restaurant Stakeout\\\" if you find your patronage decline.",
            "The first impression was a good one.  The host led us to our table and I couldn't help but notice the murals of Aztec leaders and ancient designs painted on the walls.  The dining area has a warm and inviting feel.  Festive music can be heard but not too loud.  After being greeted by a waiter in traditional garb they immediately brought us their house chips which are light and crispy and they'll bring as many as you can eat.  \\n\\nThe salsa is watery, chunky, lacks any kick and I didn't find the pico de gallo appetizing either.  But the guacamole is made fresh table-side by a charming woman who doesn't speak much but smiles a lot.  You get to choose how spicy and whether you want onions, cilantro, lime, or all of the above.  She then muddles it in a stone serving dish and lets you taste-test it before she sets it on your table and moves on.\\n\\nThe ground beef tacos are too greasy.  But the flank steak in the Tacos al Carbon is sublime compared to the other items I've tried so far.  The menu is huge so there are still plenty of items to try on return visits.  For the value and down home atmosphere it's a great alternative to the other high (snooty) and low (scary) Mexican restaurants around town.",
            "The husband and I wanted to hit up a few good buffets during our stay. We received mixed reviews for the Wynn buffet, but found it easy to eat at since we were going to watch le reve. After standing in line for about 20 mins (on a Tuesday around 7pm) we were seated. The entry way is gorg but lead back the buffet area the decor seemed a bit outdated, but still very nice.\\n\\nThe food experience - I just didn't find anything special. The food is all good, but nothing was drool worthy.  They have salads, american, Italian, grilled foods, ramen station, asian and seafood. It was a great variety, but like I said nothing stood out. My favorite was the dessert bar. It had a good variety.",
            "Massage, massage!! I am visiting from out of town and wanted a massage. They were great on getting my sceduled in on last minute. I had a neck and shoulder massage from Lawerence and i highly recommend him! I typically dont like massages because I just don't have luck with finding someone good. He was great and will come back when I visit again!",
            "This review is not about the food but the slamming ultra lounge that is The Cathouse.\\n\\nIf you like house music in a less crowded atmosphere where you can actually socialize with people, this is the lounge for you.\\n\\nDrinks are very fairly priced.  Hostesses are very professional delivering incredible service (yeah they are also hot but this is not one of those clubs).\\n\\nMake some local friends and get in without cover.\\n\\nCheck the Luxor website before you head out to the lounge.  There are different themes during the week including a hip-hop and an \\\"alternative lifestyle\\\" night.",
            "After 24 hours on the Strip, you need to get away. A 15-minute drive out to an anonymous, deserted strip mall on W. Sahara you'll find Rosemary's, whose food can compete bite-for-bite w/ the Michelin 1- and 2-star restaurants at the resorts. We deferred to the prix fixe menus and were not disappointed!",
            "I saw Keith Urban and LIttle Big Town recently, this was my first concert since moving to Phoenix. I've seen Keith up close before and to save money we chose lawn seats, the sound was great, he played in the center for several songs giving us a close up performance, his lighting and video behind the stage was super. i agree the concessions/beer prices are ridiculous but I wasn't surprised. It was a perfect night weather wise, it did run late and we left a few minutes earlier than he stopped performing.\\nI do recommend exiting the I 10 before 83rd, that's where all the traffic was. I will arrive earlier to get a better lawn seat but we had a great time, in fact will be there for Jason Aldean the 17th! For $30 sitting in my own chair in the lawn under the stars is worth it.",
            "I used to love this place. So much so, that I gave them several chances to remind me of that long lost love affair. Last 3 out of 3 times has been terrible. My hot and sour soup came to me about the color of mustard. And it was sickeningly sweet. My fried wontons were virtually meatless, and my combo fried rice didn't have any discerning flavor at all. $20 later and all i can say is that I'm so disappointed.  I will never order from them again. I will stick with Red House for my wonton fix and continue to search for a go to place for fried rice.",
            "Used to like this place now it's sucking more and more each time I go this was my last visit when I ordered country crepes and I got hash and eggs even the coke was flat",
            "One of my favorite taco places. It's super far from me but every time I'm on this side of town I always have to stop by here for a few freshly made tacos.\\n\\nIt's about $2+ per taco. All served with corn tortilla which I personally don't like since I prefer flour tortilla and to get flour tortilla it's an extra $.50 per taco (which sucks bc you would think that it's included, all those $.50s add up haha) \\n\\nWeds is buy 1 ($2) get the 2nd taco free on the pork taco ..in other words a $1 each",
            "It was pretty good. We had the calamari which was excellent. I had the fettuccine with shrimp, it was good.",
            "Atmosphere, Atmosphere, Atmosphere \\n\\nI make a pilgrimage to this place about every three months. The food is average and overpriced. The service is OK. And there is usually one good Pale Ale on tap and overpriced. \\n\\nIt is kinda like going to Disneyland. You know you are going to take in the shorts but you go anyway. You go to live the dream if only for an hour or two. \\n\\nIf you ever went fishing as a kid or wished you had,  grab your wallet or purse and eat here asap.",
            "Horrible happy hour martinis - unless you like pure sugar syrup. Food is not much better. Would not recommend it.",
            "I made appointment prior to coming here but still waited for an hour. The place is nice but looks can be deceiving because of the bad service they provided me. Please don't waste your time coming here totally not worth the wait!!!",
            "I just had a late lunch. The all you can eat sushi was not worth it. The food was not fresh. It was horrible!!! I've been here quite a few times but I don't remember the food tasting like this. First of all, the edamame was not eatable. I couldn't even get the peas out of the pods. The chicken skewers were dried and had a weird smell with it. Perhaps the meat was sitting out too long?? The sushi items we ate didn't taste fresh. Especially the tuna. We also ordered the green mussels which was burnt and ruin the rest of my appetite. Overall for lunch I should of starve.",
            "Totally avoid this place. Spend a few more $$s and go to the one at Bellagio but do so after 12noon as the Japenese and Italian stations do not open until then. The food at Flavor lacked flavor completely. It must take some effort to make simple dishes taste so bad!",
            "Breakfast to die for!!!\\n\\nMy wife and I got in late, and woke up the next day hungry. We wanted breakfast so I yelp for local places.  We have tried Hash House a Go Go, great place when not watching your calories.  I saw other places with comments $40 for breakfast ya da, ya da.  We were staying in the Venezia tower and had eaten at Bouchon's before. \\n\\n I noticed that Bouchon served breakfast so I was game.  I was not disappointed.  French pastry's, European coffee, what could be better.\\n\\nI ordered the omelet of the day, stuffed with artichoke hearts, mushrooms, and cheese.  Perfect eggs, good sausage, with brioche toast.\\n\\nMy wife had the bread pudding French toast with warm Carmel vanilla sauce. \\\"Heaven on a plate\\\" according to my wife.  \\n\\nThe service was great, and for the strip, and an upscale restaurant the $38 dollar breakfast was another great moment.\\n\\nIf you stay anywhere near this place it is a must try for breakfast.",
            "They weren't busy so the server was on the money! I tried the pulled pork fajitas and my girlfriend try the chicken fajitas. The veggies and tortillas were awesome but everything else kind of lacked flavor. The server brought out plenty of chips with three different kinds of salsa. They were unique but none really popped for me. We ordered some fried ice cream, a necessity at a Mexican restaurant, and after about 15 minutes the waitress informed us that they didn't have it. The manager offered to buy us desserts for the inconvenience, which was pretty awesome if u ask me. I had the key lime pie and the kids had the kids Sunday. I will have to try this place again and see if something else on the menu has some Zing.",
            "Disorganized. Ripoffs. Rude, airhead employees that don't clean and freely talk on there cell phones whilst you asking them a simple question. Id rather rub sand in my eyes. Disgusted.",
            "Came here on a Tues night at 6pm. Warning. If your coming after 6pm, make a reservation! We were a party of 5 and were lucky to get in. They did accommodate us, but told us we had to leave by 7.  This place got so crowded at 6pm!! Full house! Legit Japanese place. My folks had the ramen, and I had a chicken egg bowl plus a few skewers on the side. Traditional Japanese recipes coming from someone who is Japanese.My folks came with me. They ordered the ramen, but preferred Monta Ramen better.( see my review on them) \\nService was a bit hectic, but the place was packed so I don't blame them. Foo",
            "I should have reviewed this place long ago but I was too busy eating there to take the time to sit down and write. \\n\\nWe have been going here since they opened, first enticed in by a Groupon and then brought back by Chef Steve's wonderfully inspired dishes. This is a small plates restaurant so do not order one plate and expect to be full. The menu is divided into individual proteins and veggies. Read the descriptions carefully and then order enough to share. My husband and I typically order four or five plates and then hesitate over dessert. Chef Steve did a menu change recently so now we will be enjoying some new items and hope that you also try them out. Go with a group of people, its more fun\\n\\nThe Poke is one of my favorites, but make sure you mix it to get the seasoning all through it. One the new new additions is the Beef Carpaccio, Very flavorful. Also the shrimp dish, I believe its called Mini Mi's but its on a bun with slaw. The slaw is so good I would eat just that. They are so many dishes that it is truly had to remember. Checkout their ode to the Monte Cristo, it will make you weep. The owners work hard to provide good service and are always looking to improve. So.....if you want to eat and not be bothered go for lunch during the day. If you want busy with some music and noise check them out on a Friday night. They have a Facebook page that will tell you if there is something going on before you head out. Since I am all about the food, we go during the daytime. They also apparently have a happy hour but I don't know what that is about, I have just read the sign.\\n\\nThe decor is very basic, as is the plating and utensils. Because we have been coming here since the beginning, we have been able to see the changes they have made to the place over time. I can see where they have spent their money and am able to understand their choices. I would much rather have great food than great decor.",
            "I've been to The Vig a handful of times... for at least 4 lunches, a few times for just drinks / happy hour, and at least 2 dinners.  I think that is a fair amount of visits to justify the 4.5 star review rounded up to 5 stars that I am giving it now!\\n\\nI've always had friendly and attentive service, and I've never had a problem with the food or drinks I've ordered.  Granted, I've probably just ordered beer, iced tea, or water, but still :)\\n\\nI'm adding The Vig to my list of places to go for great sweet potato fries.  They also offer really yummy starters including the Vings (grilled wings), Grilled Veggie Platter, Hummus, and Ceviche.  At lunchtime, I recommend the Cobb salad although several friends of mine consistently order the Vig Azz Burger.  For dinner, I love their \\\"Miso Hungry Salmon.\\\"  \\n\\nAs mentioned in other reviews, their outdoor dining area and bocce court are just what Phoenix needs more of on a beautiful day or evening!  So much fun!\\n\\nIf this beautiful weather continues, I'll be hanging out at The Vig again very soon!",
            "Seemingly popular with the 20-somethings with long lines in the evening, we stopped in BurGR for a late lunch and it seems GR is living on his celebrity, not his cooking or service.  It took 35 minutes to get two burgers and an order of sweet potato fries to the table - cold.  The burgers were absolutely nothing special - except very expensive.  The ground beef was fresh but had sat out long enough not to be even luke-warm. Fries were stone cold.  Something I love: $9 for an order of cold fries.  Service was stretched.  Absolutely nothing special about the burgers or BurGR.  Easier to walk a block down the street to get a hot Quarter-Pounder at McDonald's.  You won't get quite the amount of beef but it will be hot and less than an third the price.  You won't be paying for the fancy curved flame wall at the entrance.  While BurGR is less expensive than other casino eateries, it is still in the category of taking your money for little in return.  Try a Big Mac - you and your pocketbook will be happier.  Don't use the excuse \\\"it's Vegas, Baby.\\\"   Ramsay is there to take your money.  I think I'm older and more experienced at decent dining than many of the reviewers for this place.  Note the reviews that say they are fans of Ramsay - doesn't have a thing to do with the food actually served - and I assure you - Ramsay didn't cook these things.",
            "While everything is fresh, I am still not impressed.  I prefer the true Mediterranean restaurants, like Spices.  This place is just another trendy spin on Mediterranean food.  Examples:  the tzatziki had chunks of cucumber (weird) and the Greek salad didn't have olives.  Won't be back.",
            "I had put off trying this restaurant due to the mixed reviews and the doubtful possibility there was quality BBQ in Pittsburgh having been so badly disapointed repeatedly.  I ordered 1/4 pound pork, 1/4 pound ribs and greens.  1/4 pound ribs were 2 bones, very small but very meaty.  I will say that this is the most expensive BBQ I have ever had anywhere in the country without a doubt.  \\n\\nThe ribs and pork have a nice dry rub.  BBQ is never spicy and this isn't either, thankfully.  It doesn't come out sauced, another blessing.  The sauce on the table is nice and complements the rub.  It's a little fruity and tangy breaking up the richness of the pork.  Please watch the char.  Burnt isn't good food.  Seriously!  The pork was succulent, there was lots of fat melting in my mouth and making me wish there was more.  I got the end piece of the rib rack but it was still fairly moist.  I wish there was more but I was already at $15 so I wasn't going to order anything else for lunch.  The greens were spot on.  Very nicely done and the portion size (for the greens) was ok. \\n\\nThe place isn't much to look at.  The service was friendly.  I don't know if it's ever going to be 5 stars for me but I will definitely be back to try it again.\\n\\nI went back!  Took Miriam just a few days later and it was exactly the same.  A good sign.  This time, in addition, I tried the brussel sprouts and they were delicious.  Bring a friend or 3.  If you order more food, the price gets cheaper.  So a 1/2 pound is less than  2 portions of a 1/4 pound for example and you can save money if you share.  It's still expensive but you can do a bit better with some planning.",

Thanks KJ!  :-)\\n\\nThe check in process was LONG-even in VIP, however I guess I shouldn't complain because it was free...\\n\\nThe room was cute and clean.   I enjoyed the views from the wraparound terrace.\\n\\nRoom service was GREAT!!!  \\n\\nI asked the bartender at the vesper bar  to  Surprise me with a drink that was fruity yet would still give me a buzz, she hooked me up with a SAGE 75!!!   Let's just say I enjoyed it to the fullest!!!  \\n\\nShopping in the hotel  left something to be desired.   \\n\\nI don't think I'll stay here again, however it was nice to experience it -  especially since it was free!  ;-)",
            "I am a big fun of French food and patisserie, I used to go to that  place 3 times a week for breakfast or lunch, but everything change there during this last year, I order Marquez, and they serve it to me almost burned, u cannot taste any thing.  \\nLast Sunday I was there they close at 4pm, I was there  at 3pm, and I want to order omelet, the server there she told me the kitchen is close, we can't cook anything, come on!!\\nI had many bad experiences there, I will never go back, there are many other French bakery in vegas",

            "Republic Ramen looks and sounds like a promising restaurant; unfortunately, my first bite told me otherwise.  While the food is not inedible, it definitely does NOT resemble traditional Japanese ramen.  I ordered an original milk tea boba & a bowl of tonkotsu ramen with pork.  The pork is nothing like the pork that comes with authentic ramen.  Instead, it was pale, tough, and flavorless.  The noodles and soup are fine but way less flavorful than I am used to from a restaurant advertising themselves as a ramen restaurant and not just a plain noodle house.  And the boba I ordered was VERY flavorless and watered down.  However, on the bright side, the boba pearls were the perfect texture and level of chewiness!",
            "No special request is too special for John.  Even a soy allergy can be handled in this awesome sushi restaurant.  Don't eat shell fish, but still want sushi?  No problem.  John's is the best hands down.",
            "Difficult to find.  Annoying bar setup with mostly garbage Bud/Miller/Coors products like Blue Moon, and they had the nerve to serve me a Guinness in a frosty glass.  Service was a bit slow.  Prices were reasonable though.  Old building on the outside but decent inside.",
            "I guess we arrived right after their rush hour because there were no tables readily available when we arrived but about 60% full which can be understandable. But we were seated within 5 minutes, but the menus took another 5 minutes to come.\\nI ordered the 4 course of salad, tandoori chicken, mixed vegetables, banana bread pudding, and a chai latte included in the end. Chicken was very tender and the salad a large order with even more salad placed on the same plate of the entree. Bread pudding very very good to finish. The gf had chicken marsala which was very sweet on its own but went very well with the garlic naan we ordered on the side. Main entrees were a bit on the smaller side.\\nThe server was joking around a little, calling my chicken KFC when it came and saying the bread pudding came with ketchup and mustard. Funny guy.",
            "On our recent one day trip to las vegas we decided to have dinner at this place since we were residing far from the strip blvrd. The menu was very interesting and very confusing, So I let the other order. My favorite was pieces of salmon, and the one with the quail egg.\\nIn general the service was really good, super friendly and very fast. Fish was very fresh.",
            "Horrible food (except the garlic bread, that was actually pretty good!).  It's annoying that they only take cash, I feel like this is 1995 again.   It's also annoying you have to go to two sections to order your drinks, you can't order them with your meal.\\n\\nHOWEVER, it's cheap entertainment.   Have a little kid? Spend $25, take the family here, they will enjoy it.",
            "My husband and I finally checked out this place after hearing about it only a couple weeks ago.  The idea of a cute storefront restaurant on Main Street intrigued us.  We went on a weeknight and found the place surprisingly full - there were only five (of about 15-20) tables available when we arrived.  However, we were quickly seated and provided with our requested drinks.\\n\\nWe had pork bellies and kale chips for our appetizers.  The pork bellies were divine.  The kale chips were a bit lacking in flair.  It was basically dry kale with paprika sprinkled on top.  Not much else.\\n\\nMy husband got the Local Dish burger and declared it good.  The fries he got on the side were great.  I ordered their chicken & peaches sandwich with coleslaw on the side.  The coleslaw was fantastic and I could have eaten more than the serving they gave me.  The chicken sandwich was average - but I loved knowing I was probably eating peaches from just a few blocks away at the Peach Stand.  The chicken itself was a bit dry but was helped by the pesto, spinach and peaches that came on it.\\n\\nWhy did I not give it more than 3 stars?  Because a second visit will be required, with other foods tried, before I decide to bump it up to four stars.  The restaurant was charming enough (and prices decent enough) that we'll most likely go back again the future.",
            "My favorite thing about Stalzy's is that they stick to the basics but they do them really well. The menu may not sound super impressive in comparison to the prices but when you get your meal the quality is superb. These sandwiches are made with quality, local ingredients and with the above average drink selection they really provide the deli experience I expect. Dont let the simple titles fool you this top notch food is worth of your lunch(or breakfast) hour any day.\\n\\nMy sandwich of choice is the ham and swiss, simple, delectable, delicious :)",

The ambiance, the decor, the food presentation were all in keeping with what a high level restaurant should be. The restaurant was not very busy as it was relatively early evening\\nSo the waiter did not rush the servings along enabling us to dine at\\nOur own pace. Our prize fixe meal was $47each plus wine, tax, and tip\\nThe three course meal consisted of a lovely green salad, the entree was salmon for me that was cooked perfectly served with what appeared to be roasted barley mix and green beans. My wife has a veal chop that she liked but what I thought was a little too rare on the inside although\\nWell charred on the outside. Desert was a glorious crime de br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e that was to die for. \\nIn summary we both thought it was a good dining experience and a good value for the price.\\nWe would go back again and recommend to friends.",
