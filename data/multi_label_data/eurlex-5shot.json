The Commission shall inform the Member States of the drawings made.\nArticle 4\nEach Member State shall ensure that importers of the products in question have equal and continuous access to the quotas for as long as the balance of the relevant quota volume so permits.\nArticle 5\nThe Member States and the Commission shall cooperate closely to ensure that this Regulation is complied with.\nArticle 6\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\nDone at Luxembourg, 29 October 1990.",

Each month Member States shall produce HICPs using weightings which reflect consumers' expenditure patterns in a weighting reference period ending no more than seven years before the preceding December.\n2. Each year, Member States shall carry out a review of weightings in order to ensure that they are sufficiently reliable and relevant to meet the comparability requirement established in Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 2494/95. The review may be confined to weightings at the level of sub-indices and their major components.\n3. In the review, Member States shall check whether or not there have been any important changes since the weighting reference period in current use regarding price developments of each major component index relative to the HICP, or sustained market developments in each major component group.\n4.

The Commission must therefore take a decision on such measures in accordance with Article 9(4) of the Decision. The Commission's assessment will depend on the compliance of the measures with the general criteria and objectives laid down in Article 2 and the specific criteria established by Articles 3 and 4 of the Decision, and on their compatibility with the proper functioning of the common market. Additionally, in accordance with Article 9(6) of the Decision, the Commission when conducting its assessment must check whether the measures conform with the modernisation, rationalisation, restructuring and activity-reduction plan which the Commission approved in its Decision 98/637/ECSC(2)).\nII\n(7) By Decision 98/637/ECSC the Commission gave an opinion as to the conformity of the 1998-2002 phase of the plan notified by Spain for the modernisation, rationalisation, restructuring and activity reduction of the coal industry with the general and specific objectives of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC.\n(8) The Commission has verified that the measures taken to modernise, rationalise, restructure and reduce activity in the coal industry during 1998, and those notified for 1999, correspond to the plans which the Commission had approved.\n(9) Spain's coal production of 1625000 tonnes in 1998 is 6,7 % lower than that shown in the plans for 1998 and 6,2 % lower than that which obtained in 1997. The production figure notified by Spain for 1999 is 16300000 tonnes, lower by 6,8 % and 3,3 % than that shown in the plans for 1998 and 1999 respectively.\n(10) The number of workers in the undertakings has fallen, from 22840 at the end of 1997 to 18498 at the end of 1998. A further reduction of 1320 workers is forecast for 1999.\n(11) During 1998 the definitive closure of mines with a production capacity of 1103000 tonnes was begun, and other mines with a total capacity of 700000 tonnes have already announced their closure in 1999.\n(12) These reductions, which are larger than those initially envisaged, are due to the inclusion in the closure plans, in conformity with Article 4 of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC, of undertakings which were unable to meet the conditions which would entitle them to operating aid under Article 3 of the Decision.\n(13) By letter of 25 September 1998 Spain notified the Commission, as required by Commission Decision 98/637/ECSC, of the undertakings' production costs in 1997. The Commission's analysis of the production costs of the undertakings or production units in receipt of operating aid (Article 3 of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC) revealed a mean reduction in the cost of production, at 1992 prices, from 109,2 ECU/tce in 1994 to 81,02 ECU/tce in 1997. This mean reduction of 25,8 % between 1992 and 1997 breaks down into a reduction of more than 30 % for 30,3 % of production, between 30 % and 20 % for 42,5 % of production, between 20 % and 10 % for 16,6 % of production and between 10 % and 0 % for 8,5 % of production. The remaining 2,1 % increased their cost of production.\n(14) The following undertakings or production units: Antracitas de Guillón S.A., Antracitas de Rengos S.A., ENCASUR (underground mines component only), Inversiones Terrales S.A., Minas de Escucha S.A., Ramiro Genuario y otras S.A., Antracitas de Rodrigatos, S.A., with a total annual production of 675800 tonnes, have been included by Spain, according to its notification of 16 October 1998, in a closure plan with a deadline occurring before the date of expiry of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC. The Commission has checked that the conditions laid down in Article 3(2) of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC cannot be achieved by these undertakings, so they do indeed qualify for activity-reduction aid in accordance with Article 4 of the Decision.\n(15) If Spain finds that other undertakings are experiencing difficulties in making further progress towards economic viability it will inform the Commission and, if so, propose activity-reduction measures as provided for in Article 4 of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC.\n(16) Throughout the period from 1999 to 2002 Spain will continue to monitor production cost trends at each of the coal undertakings and, should the undertakings prove unable to achieve the trend downwards in production costs provided for in Article 3(2) of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC, will propose the necessary corrective measures to the Commission.\n(17) One of the conditions laid down by the Commission in its Decision 98/637/ECSC on the conformity of the Spanish coal industry's modernisation, rationalisation, restructuring and activity-reduction plan with the general and specific objectives of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC, is that Spain must ensure that, between 1 January 1998 and the date of closure, no aid is granted to cover the production costs of the mines formerly belonging to Minas de Lieres SA, which were put back into production by Hunosa. The Commission notes that for 1998 and 1999 the mines in question experienced or are set to experience production losses valued respectively at ESP 193300000 (EUR 1161756,40) and ESP 169000000 (EUR 1015710,46). On the basis of the information in the letter of 16 April 1999 from Spain, the Commission notes that the operating losses of the old Minas de Lieres mines were not covered by aid during 1998 and that no aid has been set aside for them for 1999. These mines must close down definitively by 31 December 1999.\n(18) The aid notified by Spain to cover operating losses in 1999 provides for a reduction in production aid compared with 1998, at current currency values, of 4 % for underground mines and 6 % for open-cast mines. The total amount of aid, i.e. aid for current production plus aid to cover exceptional restructuring costs, fell by 8 %. These reductions will help to achieve the objective of degression of aid. The aid to cover the production costs of the undertakings or production units, i.e. the aid under Articles 3 and 4 of the Decision, is intended to cover all or part of the difference between the production costs and the selling price freely agreed between the contracting parties in the light of the conditions prevailing on the world market.\n(19) The reduction in the aid notified for 1999 compared with 1998 is still more notable when the fall in the selling price of coal on the world market is taken into consideration.\n(20) In accordance with Article 2(2) of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC, all the aid which Spain plans to grant to the coal industry under the said Decision in 1999 has been entered in national, regional or local public budgets. Part of this aid to Hunosa could be channelled via SEPI (Sociedad Estatal de Participaciones Industriales).\n(21) In view of the above, the measures notified by Spain for 1999 are deemed to be in line with the modernisation, rationalisation, restructuring and activity-reduction plans approved by the Commission in its Decision 98/637/ECSC, provided all the conditions laid down in the Decision are complied with, particularly those relating to non-discrimination between producers, between purchasers or between users of coal in the Community.\nIII\n(22) The aid of ESP 121030 million (EUR 727404949,94) which Spain plans to grant the coal industry in 1999 is intended to compensate in full or in part for operating losses suffered by coal undertakings.\n(23) It is intended to cover the difference between the production costs and the selling price freely agreed between the contracting parties in the light of the conditions prevailing on the world market.\n(24) The sum notified subdivides into operating aid of ESP 54544 million (EUR 327816042,22) under Article 3 of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC, and activity-reduction aid of ESP 66486 million (EUR 399588907,72) under Article 4 thereof.\n(25) The operating aid of ESP 54544 million (EUR 327816042,22) is intended to cover the operating losses of 57 undertakings with a combined envisaged production of 13335 million tonnes in 1999.\n(26) The Commission notes, after verifying the production costs of these undertakings, at 1992 prices, that the downward trend of production costs observed in the period 1994-1997 will continue in 1999. The reduction envisaged for 1999, compared with 1997, will be 7,2 %.\n(27) In 1997 the mean production cost, at 1992 prices, of the undertakings receiving aid under Article 3 of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC is 81,02 ECU/tce, broken down as follows:\n- 10 %of production at costs between42 and57 ECU/tce;\n- 10 %of production at costs between59 and62 ECU/tce;\n- 10 %of production at costs between63 and71 ECU/tce;\n- 10 %of production at costs between72 and81 ECU/tce;\n- 10 %of production at costs between82 and85 ECU/tce;\n- 10 %of production at costs between86 and87 ECU/tce;\n- 10 %of production at costs between88 and90 ECU/tce;\n- 10 %of production at costs between91 and92 ECU/tce;\n- 10 %of production at costs between93 and95 ECU/tce;\n- 10 %of production at costs between96 and 129 ECU/tce.\n(28) Spain will notify the Commission, by no later than 30 September 1999, of the undertakings' production costs for 1998, to enable the Commission to verify the downward trend of these costs over the period 1994 to 1998.\n(29) The mean selling price to the thermal power stations of the 13335000 tonnes (8476700 tce) of production envisaged in 1999 by the undertakings in receipt of operating aid is ESP 5955/tonne (EUR 35,79/tonne). In the light of the envisaged mean cost of this production in 1999, namely ESP 10046/tonne (EUR 60,38/tonne), the Commission notes that the aid notified corresponds to the difference between the cost of production and the selling price freely agreed between the contracting parties in the light of the conditions prevailing on the world market.\n(30) Of the aid of ESP 66486 million (EUR 399588907,72) to reduce activity, ESP 58442 million (EUR 351243494,04) is intended to cover the operating losses of Hunosa; ESP 5147 million (EUR 30934093,01) the operating losses of Mina la Camocha; ESP 624 million (EUR 3750315,53) the operating losses of the underground workings of Endesa; ESP 533 million (EUR 3203394,52) the operating losses of the Encasur underground workings; ESP 1115 million (EUR 6701284,96) the operating losses of Antracitas de Guillón; ESP 271 million (EUR 1628742,80) the operating losses of Antracitas de Rengos; and ESP 354 million (EUR 2127582,85) the operating losses of Minas de Escucha, with the combined production of these undertakings totalling an envisaged 3 million tonnes in 1999.\n(31) Of the aid of ESP 58442 million (EUR 351243494,04) to Hunosa, ESP 39555 million (EUR 237730337,89) will be granted via SEPI.\n(32) The mean selling price to the thermal power stations of the 3000 million tonnes (2350000 tce) of production envisaged in 1999 by the undertakings in receipt of aid to reduce activity is ESP 5350/tonne (EUR 3215/tonne). In the light of the envisaged mean cost of this production in 1999, namely ESP 27550/tonne (EUR 165,58/tonne), the Commission notes that that the aid notified corresponds to the difference between the cost of production and the selling price freely agreed between the contracting parties in the light of the conditions prevailing on the world market.\n(33) The aid to cover the operating losses suffered by coal undertakings has been entered in the general State budgets for 1999. It is 5 % lower than the aid authorised by the Commission for 1998. Spain sent notification of the Spanish Council of Ministers' decision on the company-by-company allocation of this aid. This decision has been published in Spain's Boletin Official del Estado(3)).\n(34) The inclusion of this measure in the modernisation, rationalisation, restructuring and activity-reduction plan notified by Spain, and the reduction in the aid and quantities envisaged for 1999, are in line with the objectives of the first and second indents of Article 2(1) of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC, and in particular the objective to solve the social and regional problems created by developments in the coal industry.\n(35) In view of the above, and on the basis of the information provided by Spain, this aid is compatible with Articles 3 and 4 of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC and with the proper functioning of the common market.\nIV\n(36) The aid of ESP 44141 million (EUR 265292753) which Spain is proposing to grant is intended to cover, with the exception of the costs for the payment of social-welfare benefits borne by the State as a special contribution pursuant to Article 56 of the Treaty, compensation paid to workers in Spanish coal undertakings who have lost their jobs or have had to or will have to take early retirement under the modernisation, rationalisation, restructuring and activity-reduction plan for the Spanish coal industry.\n(37) Part of this aid, totalling ESP 34046 million (EUR 204620581,06), is to be granted to Hunosa to cover the costs for the workers who took early retirement before 1 January 1999 and the 536 workers who will retire in 1999. This part of the aid will be granted to Hunosa via SEPI.\n(38) The remaining ESP 10095 million (EUR 60672171,94) is intended to cover compensation for the approximately 1000 workers who will lose their jobs in 1999 in the other undertakings affected by modernisation, rationalisation, restructuring and activity-reduction measures.\n(39) This aid, designed to cover exceptional costs that have arisen or are due to arise from restructuring, has been entered in the general State budgets for 1999.\n(40) These financial measures relate to action made necessary by the modernisation, rationalisation and restructuring of the Spanish coal industry and cannot therefore be considered to be related to current production (inherited liabilities).\n(41) Pursuant to Article 5 of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC the aid mentioned explicitly in the Annex to the Decision, namely the cost of paying social-welfare benefits resulting from the pensioning-off of workers before they reach statutory retirement age and other exceptional expenditure on workers who lose their jobs as a result of restructuring and rationalisation, may be considered compatible with the common market provided that the amount paid does not exceed such costs.\n(42) In view of the above and on the basis of the information provided by Spain, this aid is compatible with Article 5 of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC and with the proper functioning of the common market.\nV\n(43) The aid of ESP 13079 million (EUR 78606373,13) which Spain proposes to grant is intended to cover part of the loss of value of the fixed assets of coal undertakings which have to close down totally or partially, and other exceptional costs to enable undertakings to cover the costs that have arisen or are due to arise from the progressive closures connected with the restructuring of the coal industry.\n(44) Part of this aid, totalling ESP 2754 million (EUR 16551873,35), will be granted to Hunosa via SEPI. Since Minas de Lieres S.A. received closure aid in Spain's 1991 to 1993 restructuring plan it is not therefore entitled to receive any other aid to cover the costs of closure, which must be completed by no later than 31 December 1999. The remaining sum, totalling ESP 10325 million (EUR 62054499,78), will be granted to the other undertakings that are restructuring or reducing their activity.\n(45) The aid to cover exceptional costs arising or due to arise from restructuring has been entered in the general State budgets for 1999.\n(46) These financial measures relate to action made necessary by the modernisation, rationalisation and restructuring of the Spanish coal industry and cannot therefore be considered to be related to current production (inherited liabilities).\n(47) Pursuant to Article 5 of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC, the aid mentioned explicitly in the Annex to the Decision, namely exceptional intrinsic depreciation provided that it results from the restructuring of the industry (without taking account of any revaluation which has occurred- since 1 January 1986 and which exceeds the rate of inflation) and other additional work and residual costs arising from closures of installations, can be considered compatible with the common market provided that the amount paid does not exceed such costs.\n(48) Spain must ensure that the aid granted to undertakings to cover exceptional costs is in line with the categories of costs specified in the Annex to Decision No 3632/93/ECSC.\n(49) In view of the above, and on the basis of the information provided by Spain, this aid is compatible with Article 5 of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC and with the proper functioning of the common market.\nVI\n(50) The aid granted by Spain to the coal industry is restricted to coal production destined to be used for electricity production. Spain undertakes to ensure that the coal sold to the industrial and domestic sectors is sold at prices (exempt from compensation) that cover the costs of production.\n(51) Spain must ensure that the aid granted to current production under this Decision does not give rise to any discrimination between coal producers, between purchasers or between users on the Community coal market.\n(52) Spain undertakes to ensure that, within the framework of the provisions of Article 86 of the Treaty, the aid is limited to that which is strictly necessary in the light of the social and regional considerations which characterise the decline of the Community's coal industry. The aid may not give any economic advantage, whether directly or indirectly, to productions for which no aid is authorised or to other activities distinct from coal production.\n(53) In accordance with the second indent of Article 3(1) and with Article 9(2) and (3) of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC the Commission must verify that the aid authorised for current production responds exclusively to the objectives stated in Articles 3 and 4 of the Decision. Spain must notify the Commission, by no later than 30 June 2000, of the amount of aid actually paid during 1999, and declare any corrections made to the amounts originally notified. When submitting this annual statement of aid paid, Spain must also supply the Commission with all the information necessary for verification of the criteria set out in the Articles in question.\n(54) In approving the aid, the Commission has recognised the need to soften, as far as possible, the social and regional impact of the restructuring of the coal industry, given the economic and social situation surrounding the mines affected.\n(55) In view of the above, and on the basis of the information provided by Spain, the measures and the aid proposed for the coal industry are deemed to be compatible with the objectives of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC and with the proper functioning of the common market.\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\nArticle 1\nSpain is hereby authorised to pay the following aid in respect of 1999:\n(a) operating aid of ESP 54544 million (EUR 327816042,22) under Article 3 of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC;\n(b) aid for the reduction of activity of ESP 66486 million (EUR 399588971,72) under Article 4 of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC;\n(c) aid of ESP 44141 million (EUR 265292753), under Article 5 of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC, to cover exceptional welfare aid for workers who lose their jobs as a result of the measures to modernise, rationalise, restructure and reduce the activity of the Spanish coal industry;\n(d) aid of ESP 13079 million (EUR 78606373,13), under Article 5 of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC, to cover the exceptional technical costs of closing down mining installations as a result of the measures to modernise, rationalise, restructure and reduce the activity of the Spanish coal industry.\nArticle 2\nIn accordance with Article 86 of the ECSC Treaty, Spain shall adopt all appropriate measures, whether general or particular, to ensure fulfilment of the obligations resulting from this Decision. It shall ensure that the aid authorised is used for the purposes intended and that any unspent, overestimated or incorrectly used aid for any item covered by this Decision is repaid to it.\nArticle 3\nSpain shall notify the Commission, by 30 June 2000 at the latest, of the amount of aid actually paid in respect of 1999.\nArticle 4\nThis Decision is addressed to the Kingdom of Spain.\nDone at Brussels, 4 May 1999.",

There is a risk that the disease agent might be spread from wild birds to domestic birds, notably poultry, and from one Member State to other Member States and third countries through the international trade in live birds or their products.\n(2)\nCases of highly pathogenic avian influenza of the subtype virus H5NI are suspected or confirmed in several Member States. Taking into account the epidemiological situation, the Commission adopted Decision 2006/115/EC of 17 February 2006 concerning certain protection measures in relation to highly pathogenic avian influenza in wild birds in the Community and repealing Decisions 2006/86/EC, 2006/90/EC, 2006/91/EC, 2006/94/EC, 2006/104/EC and 2006/105/EC (4).\n(3)\nThe specific measures provided for in this Decision should apply without prejudice to the measures to be taken by Member States in the framework of Council Directive 92/40/EEC of 19 May 1992 introducing Community measures for the control of avian influenza (5).\n(4)\nHowever, the measures provided for in Directive 92/40/EEC are minimum control measures and require supplementary provisions notably on the movement of certain birds and of products from poultry and other birds originating in the zone affected by the disease in wild birds.\n(5)\nIt is necessary to clarify the interaction between Community measures taken in relation to highly pathogenic avian influenza caused by an influenza A virus of the serotype H5N1 in wild birds and those to be applied in case of the disease in poultry.\n(6)\nIt appeared also necessary to further specify the starting point for the minimum duration of the measures provided for in this Decision.\n(7)\nIt is appropriate to control and restrict the movement of, in particular, live birds and hatching eggs while allowing the controlled dispatch from the zones of such birds and products of avian origin subject to certain conditions. However certain adjustments are admissible as long as they are in accordance with the relevant provisions of the above Directive.\n(8)\nTransport of hatching eggs from the protection zones should be permitted under certain conditions. Specific derogations should be provided for hatching eggs or SPF-eggs used in specialised laboratories or institutes for scientific, diagnostic or pharmaceutical purposes.\n(9)\nCouncil Directive 2002/99/EC of 16 December 2002 laying down the animal health rules governing the production, processing, distribution and introduction of products of animal origin for human consumption (6), establishes a list of treatments rendering meat from restricted areas safe, and provides for the possibility to establish a specific health mark and the health mark required for meat not authorised for placing on the market for animal health reasons. It is appropriate to permit the dispatch from the protection zones of meat bearing the health mark provided for in that Directive and meat products subjected to treatment referred to therein.\n(10)\nCommission Regulation (EC) No 2076/2005 of 5 December 2005 laying down transitional arrangements for the implementation of Regulations (EC) No 853/2004, (EC) No 854/2004 and (EC) No 882/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council and amending Regulations (EC) No 853/2004 and (EC) No 854/2004 (7), provides for transitional measures allowing the use of a national identification mark for products of animal origin intended for human consumption which may only be marketed in the national territory of the Member State where they are produced.\n(11)\nRegulation (EC) No 1774/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 3 October 2002 laying down health rules concerning animal by-products not intended for human consumption (8), authorises the placing on the market of a range of animal by-products, such as gelatine for technical use, materials for pharmaceutical use and others, originating in areas of the Community under animal health restrictions, because those products are considered safe due to the specific conditions of production, processing and utilisation that effectively inactivate possible pathogens or prevent contact with susceptible animals. However it should also be possible to authorise the transport of such by-products to designated processing plants in order to be treated to the standards mentioned above, or to avail of the derogations provided for in Article 23 of that Regulation.\n(12)\nCommission Decision 2006/115/EC should be amended accordingly.\n(13)\nThe measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\nArticle 1\nDecision 2006/115/EC is amended as follows:\n1.\nthe following paragraph is added to Article 2:\n‘5. The measures laid down in this Decision shall be applied without prejudice to the measures to be applied in the event of an outbreak of avian influenza in poultry taken in accordance with Directive 92/40/EEC or, where applicable, to more stringent Community protective measures in relation to highly pathogenic avian influenza in poultry caused by an influenza virus of the type H5N1.’;\n2.\nthe second paragraph of Article 5 is replaced by the following:\n‘If the presence of a highly pathogenic influenza A virus, in particular of the subtype H5N1, is confirmed in wild birds, the measures provided for in Articles 3 and 4 shall apply for as long as is necessary having regard to the geographical, administrative, ecological and epizootiological factors relating to avian influenza and for at least 21 in the case of the protection zone and 30 days in the case of the surveillance zone after the date of collection from wild birds of the samples on which a highly pathogenic H5 avian influenza virus was confirmed.’;\n3.\nArticle 6(1) is replaced by the following:\n‘1. By way of derogation from Article 3(2)(a), the affected Member State may authorise the transport of\n(a)\npoultry and farmed feathered game to holdings under official control situated either in the protection or in the surveillance zone;\n(b)\nready-to-lay pullets to holdings under official control in the same Member State and the poultry shall remain on the holding of destination for 21 days following the arrival of those pullets.’;\n4.\nArticle 6(2)(b) is replaced by the following:\n‘(b)\nday-old chicks from the protection zone to holdings under official control on its territory provided, that either on the holding of destination there are no other poultry or captive birds, except pet birds referred to in Article 1(2)(c)(i), which are kept separated from poultry, or the transport is carried out under the conditions described in Article 24(1)(a) and (b) of Directive 2005/94/EC and the poultry shall remain on the holding of destination for 21 days following the arrival of those chicks;’\n5.\nthe following is added to Article 7(1):\n‘(c)\nthe dispatch of hatching eggs or SPF-eggs from the protection zone to designated laboratories or institutes for scientific, diagnostic or pharmaceutical uses.’;\n6.\nthe following is added to Article 8(1):\n‘(g)\nfresh meat from poultry or farmed feathered game, minced meat and meat preparations and mechanically separated meat containing such meat, obtained from slaughter poultry or farmed feathered game originating in or outside that zone to the remaining part of its national territory, if such meat:\n(i)\nwas, in accordance with Article 4 of Directive 2002/99/EC, identified either with the mark provided for in Annex II to Directive 2002/99/EC or the national mark established in accordance with Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 2076/2005;\n(ii)\nwas obtained, cut, stored and transported separately from other fresh meat from poultry or farmed feathered game destined for dispatch to other Member States or for exports to third countries; and\n(iii)\nis used in such a way as to avoid it being introduced into meat products or meat preparations intended for placing on the market in other Member States or for export to third countries, unless it has undergone the treatment as required for avian influenza specified in table 1(a), (b) or (c) of Annex III to Directive 2002/99/EC.’\n7.\nArticle 8(2) is deleted.\n8.\nArticle 9(1)(a) is replaced by the following:\n‘(a)\nanimal by-products which\n(i)\ncomply with the conditions set out in Chapters II(A), III(B), IV(A), VI(A and B), VII(A), VIII(A), IX(A) and X(A) of Annex VII, and Chapter II(B) and Chapter III Title (II)(A) of Annex VIII to Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002; or\n(ii)\nare transported under bio-secure conditions to designated processing plants approved in accordance with Chapter III or Chapter IV of Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 for treatment to ensure at least the inactivation of the avian influenza virus; or\n(iii)\nare transported under bio-secure conditions for processing into feed for animals in accordance with the derogation provided for in Article 23(2)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002.’\nArticle 2\nMember States shall immediately adopt and publish the measures necessary to comply with this Decision. They shall immediately inform the Commission thereof.\nArticle 3\nAddressee\nThis Decision is addressed to the Member States.\nDone at Brussels, 7 April 2006.",

whereas, in order to make the free movement of persons fully effective, the social security schemes applicable to them should be coordinated;\n(6) Whereas, for reasons of equity, specific rules applicable to employed and self-employed persons should be applied to students; whereas those rules, for the sake of simplicity and clarity, should supplement the provisions already in force for employed and self-employed persons and members of their families;\n(7) Whereas it is necessary to adapt Regulations (EEC) No 1408/71 and (EEC) No 574/72 as necessary for their provisions to apply to students moving within the Community, taking account of the specific situation of those persons, the special features of the schemes under which they are insured, and the benefits to which they are entitled;\n(8) Whereas, although the specific nature of the situation relating to students may not have enabled rules to be laid down to determine which legislation is applicable, it is nevertheless desirable, as far as possible, to prevent the persons concerned from being subject to a double levy of contributions, or acquiring dual rights to benefits;\n(9) Whereas the adaptations to be made to the enacting terms of Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 require adaptation of Annex VI thereto;\n(10) Whereas the specific situation of Luxembourg, where all students who study abroad are entitled to health care, justifies such students being automatically exempted from the requirement to join a health insurance scheme in the country in which they pursue their studies;\n(11) Whereas, because of the specific situation of students, it has not been possible to set up a comprehensive system for the coordination of the social security rights of students at Community level, in particular in respect of invalidity benefits; whereas social security benefits available to students vary greatly between Member States particularly with regard to special non-contributory benefits designed to help towards the additional costs arising from the care and mobility needs of disabled people; whereas the Court of Justice of the European Communities has recognised that the detailed rules for granting certain benefits are closely linked to a particular economic and social context; whereas a limited derogation from the rules on the coordination of periods applied by Article 10a(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 is therefore justified;\n(12) Whereas the Treaty has not provided the necessary powers to take appropriate measures within the field of social security for students, and therefore having recourse to Article 235, in addition to Article 51, is justified;\n(13) Whereas this Regulation applies without prejudice to the conditions laid down by Directive 93/96/EEC (6) for the right of residence for students,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nRegulation (EEC) No 1408/71 is hereby amended as follows:\n1. Article 1 is hereby amended as follows:\n(a) the following point shall be added after point (c):\n'(ca) \"student\" means any person other than an employed or self-employed person or a member of his family or survivor within the meaning of this Regulation who studies or receives vocational training leading to a qualification officially recognised by the authorities of a Member State, and is insured under a general social security scheme or a special social security scheme applicable to students;`\n(b) in points (f), (i) and (ii), the words 'employed or self-employed person` shall be replaced by the words 'employed or self-employed person or student`;\n2.

This Regulation shall apply to the survivors of employed or self-employed persons and of students who have been subject to the legislation of one or more Member States, irrespective of the nationality of such persons, where their survivors are nationals of one of the Member States, or stateless persons or refugees residing within the territory of one of the Member States.`;\n3. in Article 9a, in the German text, the words 'der Arbeitnehmer oder Selbständige` shall be replaced by the words 'die Person`;\n4. in Article 10(2), the words 'as an employed or self-employed person` shall be deleted;\n5. Article 22c shall be deleted;\n6. in Chapter 1 of Title III, the following Section shall be added:\n'Section 5a\nPersons who study or receive vocational training and members of their families\nArticle 34a\nSpecial provisions for students and members of their families\nThe provisions of Article 18, Article 19, Article 22(1)(a) and (c), the second subparagraph of Article 22(2), Article 22(3), Article 23, Article 24 and of Sections 6 and 7 shall apply by analogy to students and to members of their families, as appropriate.\nArticle 34b\nCommon provisions\nA person, as referred to in Article 22(1) and (3) and in Article 34a, who stays in a Member State other than the competent State to study there or receive vocational training leading to a qualification officially recognised by the authorities of a Member State, and the members of his family accompanying him during his stay, shall be covered by the provisions of Article 22(1)(a) for any conditions necessitating benefits during the stay in the territory of the Member State where such person is studying or in training.`;\n7. in Article 35(3), the words 'shall apply neither to employed or self-employed persons nor to the members of their families` shall be replaced by 'shall not apply to persons`;\n8. in Chapter 4 of Title III, the following Section shall be added:\n'Section 5\nStudents\nArticle 63a\nThe provisions of Sections 1 to 4 shall apply by analogy to students.`;\n9. the following Article shall be inserted:\n'Article 66a\nStudents\nThe provisions of Articles 64 to 66 shall apply by analogy to students and the members of their family.`;\n10. the following Article shall be inserted:\n'Article 76a\nStudents\nThe provisions of Article 72 shall apply by analogy to students.`;\n11. the following Article shall be inserted:\n'Article 95d\nTransitional provisions applicable to students\n1.

Any period of insurance and, where appropriate, any period of employment, self-employment or residence completed under the legislation of a Member State before 1 May 1999 shall be taken into account for the determination of rights acquired in accordance with the provisions of this Regulation.\n3. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 1, a right shall be acquired under this Regulation even if it relates to a contingency arising prior to 1 May 1999.\n4. Any benefit that has not been awarded or that has been suspended on account of the nationality or the residence of the person concerned shall, at the latter's request, be awarded or resumed from 1 May 1999, provided that the rights for which benefits were previously awarded did not give rise to a lump-sum payment.\n5. If the request referred to in paragraph 4 is lodged within two years from 1 May 1999, rights deriving from this Regulation in favour of students, members of their families and their survivors shall be acquired from that date and the provisions of the legislation of any Member State on the forfeiture or lapse of rights may not be applied to the persons concerned.\n6. If the request referred to in paragraph 4 is lodged after expiry of the period of two years following 1 May 1999, rights not forfeited or lapsed shall be acquired from the date of such request, subject to any more favourable provisions of the legislation of any Member State.`;\n12. Annex VI shall be amended as follows:\n(a) in section 'D. SPAIN` the following point shall be added:\n'9. The Spanish special scheme for students (\"Seguro Escolar\") is not based, for the recognition of benefits, on completion of periods of insurance, employment and residence as those expressions are defined in Article 1(r), (s) and (sa) of the Regulation. The Spanish institutions cannot therefore issue the relevant certificates for the purposes of aggregating periods.\nNevertheless, the Spanish special scheme for students will apply to students who are nationals of other Member States and who are studying in Spain, under the same conditions as students of Spanish nationality.`;\n(b) in section 'I. LUXEMBOURG`, the following point shall be added:\n'8.

THE FACTS\nA. Subject matter of the proceeding 1. On 13 December 1978, an agreement was concluded in Brussels, Belgium, called the \"Agreement concerning the use of the NAVEWA-ANSEAU conformity label for washing-machines and dishwashers\", hereinafter referred to as \"the Agreement\". The Agreement seeks to make compulsory, with effect from 1 January 1979, the attachment to washing machines and dishwashers intended for the Belgian market of a conformity label certifying that they conform to the general safety requirements laid down by water companies for the avoidance of contamination of publicly-supplied drinking water.\nB. The relevant market\n2. In 1980, total imports of washing machines into Belgium and Luxembourg were valued at 54 million ECU, including imports worth 51 77 million ECU from EEC Member States ; total imports of dishwashers into Belgium and Luxembourg were valued at 18 78 million ECU, including imports worth 18 73 million ECU from EEC Member States. In 1977, Belgian manufacture of \"white goods\" (washing machines, dishwashers, refrigerators and freezers) accounted for less than 10 % of apparent Belgian consumption of those products.\nC. Parties to the Agreement\n(1) First party:\n3. Manufacturers and sole importers affiliated to one or more of the following organizations: - the Communauté de l'Électricité (CEG) in Brussels, Belgium. This non-profit-making body, founded in 1956, comprises companies which generate and supply electricity, manufacturers and importers of electrical (1) OJ No 13, 21.2.1962, p. 204/62. (2) OJ No 127, 20.8.1963, p. 2268/63. appliances, professional associations and technical bodies concerned with the applications of electricity. Its object is to promote directly and indirectly the development of electricity in all its forms. The CEG consists of groups of members (13 at present), including the two groups, Laundry Care and Dishwashers, whose representatives took part in the discussions with ANSEAU to draw up the Agreement; - the Fédération du Commerce de l'Appareillage Électrique (FCAE-FHEA) in Brussels, Belgium. This non-profit-making body, founded in 1946, comprises manufacturers, importers and distributors of domestic electrical appliances. Its objective is to promote ethical and material improvements in the electrical appliances wholesale, import and export sectors.\n- the Union des Fournisseurs des Artisans de l'alimentation - Division Grandes Cuisines (UFARAL-ULEVO) in Brussels, Belgium. This association comprises manufacturers and importers of cookers and other equipment for use in canteens and restaurants, etc.\n4. The list of firms making up the first party at the time of signature of the Agreement is given in Annex I to this Decision. Moreover, on the basis of Article 4.1 of the Agreement, other manufacturers or sole importers acceded to the Agreement following its signature. The list of these firms is given in Annex II to this Decision. The UFARAL, although not an undertaking, is itself a party to the Agreement and not only through its members.\n(2) Second party:\n5. The Association Nationale des Services d'Eau (ANSEAU-NAVEWA) in Brussels, Belgium.\nThe objective of this non-profit-making body, founded in 1948, is to safeguard the common interests of water-supply companies in Belgium. The 31 water-supply companies which are members of ANSEAU are incorporated in various legal forms (joint local authority undertakings, utilities, associations of public authorities or companies that are partly privately owned companies). They were set up by the public authorities with the aim of providing regular supply and distribution of water under conditions which fully guarantee the protection of public health. In 1965, ANSEAU drew up its general rules on users' equipment for Belgian territory, following the entry into force of a Royal Decree making suppliers liable under criminal law for the quality of water.\nD. The main provisions of the Agreement\n6. The purpose of the Agreement is \"to prevent, in the interests of public health, any deterioration in the quality of the water supplied due to contamination or pollution, particularly when washing machines or dishwashers are connected to the drinking-water supply\" (Article 1 of the Agreement).\n7. \"The Agreement shall govern the use of the NAVEWA-ANSEAU conformity label for washing machines and dishwashers\" (Article 2). A set of special rules is annexed to the Agreement, laying down the technical requirements regarding conformity which such machines must meet. The main provisions of the Agreement are as follows:\n8. - The Agreement, which came into force on 1 January 1979, is to apply for a period of three years. It is automatically extended for a further period of three years at the end of each such period (Article 3).\n9. - For the purposes of implementation of the Agreement, the CEG acts as the representative of the firms comprising the first party (Article 4.1).\n10. - Conformity labels shall be distributed solely by the CEG (Article 5). The CEG obtains the labels from ANSEAU at a charge of Bfrs 3 750 for each label issued (Annex II to the Agreement).\nThe CEG issues the labels to the contracting parties at the following prices: - Bfrs 4 for CEG members in the two groups, Laundry Care and Dishwashers,\n- Bfrs 5 for CEG members who are not in the abovementioned groups,\n- Bfrs 6 for users who are not members of the CEG.\n11. - \"The contracting parties undertake to submit to ANSEAU via the CEG, prior to the placing on the Belgian market of new or modified machines, a complete technical file incorporating the following information: - All the data necessary for identification (...),\n- a detailed technical plan of the complete hydraulic circuit of the machines\" (Article 6).\n12. - \"ANSEAU shall carry out random sampling checks of the market at regular intervals in order to determine whether the machines placed in commercial distribution bear the conformity label and, if so, whether they in fact meet the technical requirements regarding conformity laid down in the special rules. Where there are justifiable grounds for so doing, the CEG may also request that ANSEAU carry out specific checks at a particular location\" (Article 8.1).\n13. - \"Where ANSEAU establishes, in the course of such checks, that a machine does not bear the conformity label, it shall inform the dealer concerned, by registered letter, that the machine in question does not meet the requirements for the connection of washing machines and dishwashers to the supply system\" (Article 8.2).\n14. The main provisions of the special rules annexed to the Agreement, which, as stated in Article 11 of the Agreement, are an integral part of it, are as follows:\n15. - Washing machines and dishwashers shall be regarded as meeting the technical requirements regarding conformity where they completely fulfil the requirements of the general rules on users' equipment, as supplemented by the Rules concerning the construction and inspection of washing machines and dishwashers (Article 1).\n16. - Article 38 of the general rules includes the following provision which laid down the requirements governing conformity inspection prior to the implementation of the new Agreement : \"Washing machines and dishwashers which are not on the list of appliances recognized by ANSEAU as conforming to the requirements may not be connected to the water-supply system. This list may be consulted at the offices of the water services.\"\n17. - The contracting parties themselves shall be responsible for determining whether machines to be placed on the Belgian market meet the abovementioned technical requirements regarding conformity. They may obtain the technical assistance of ANSEAU for this purpose. The first party shall be entitled to obtain ANSEAU's technical assistance 100 times each year, with exemption from payment (Article 2.1). Any further assistance rendered shall be paid for at the rate laid down in Article 1 of Annex II to the Agreement. The cost shall be approximately Bfrs 4 000 for one morning, in the course of which 10 machines may be inspected.\n18. - Where it is found that the conformity label has been affixed to machines which do not meet the abovementionned technical requirements, the labels concerned must be removed within 10 days, unless the machines are made to conform to the requirements within the same period. The contracting party responsible shall, in addition, make a flat-rate payment to ANSEAU of Bfrs 50 000. If the contracting party does not comply with the penalties imposed within the prescribed period, or if he repeats the offence within three years, he shall lose the right to use the conformity label definitively (Article 3).\n19. - Provision is made for the following transitional measures to be applied until 31 December 1979 at the latest: - \"The first party shall add to the ANSEAU list of approved machines, which shall be applicable until 31 December 1978, the most recent manufacturer's serial number issued prior to that date,\n- all machines bearing a subsequent manufacturer's serial number shall fall within the scope of this Agreement,\n- all machines bearing an earlier manufacturer's serial number shall fall within the scope of the former rules. As from 1 April 1979, such machines shall, however, be accompanied by a certificate of conformity, including a detachable label to be affixed to the machine before it is put into service\" (Article 6).\nE. Origins of the Agreement\n20. On 25 July 1978, a meeting was held at ANSEAU's registered office between the representatives of the two CEG groups, Laundry Care and Dishwashers, and the FCAE and the representatives of ANSEAU. The latter stated that the existing arrangements had the following disadvantages:\n\" - both buyers and the water-supply company must consult the list in order to check whether the machine is listed,\n- machines with the same hydraulic system but different numbering must be checked individually, which in some cases adds considerably to the cost of checking.\n\"\nThe FCAE stated that:\n\"certain unofficial importers (known as parallel importers) also benefit from the verification obtained by the official importer without having to share in the costs.\"\n21. At a meeting on 21 September 1978, ANSEAU's working group of legal experts made the following observations on a preliminary draft Agreement submitted on 8 September 1978: - \"The proposed Agreement between ANSEAU and the washing machine and dishwasher distributors concerned would enable 90 % of production to be checked. In order to check the remaining 10 %, \"the possibility might be considered of authorizing the distributors to establish the necessary contacts with those not party to the Agreement, with a view to making the conformity labels available to them also, on condition that they provide the distributors who are parties to the Agreement with the necessary guarantees and undertakings.\"\n- \"The Agreement in question would be provisional only, pending the issue by the EEC of Directives on the subject, which are currently being drafted.\"\n- \"It is advisable to draft the introduction in such a way as to emphasize the objectives of the parties concerned. As far as ANSEAU is concerned, the objective is most definitely to safeguard the quality of the water supplied and protect the health and safety of the consumer.\"\n- \"If the water companies find that a user has a machine which does not bear a conformity label, it will be their responsibility to check whether the machine meets the requirements regarding conformity ; it will not, therefore, be able to claim payment for this service from the user.\"\n22. On 19 September 1978, at a joint meeting of the two CEG groups, Laundry Care and Dishwashers, the chairmen of the two groups reviewed the current negotiations with ANSEAU. They stated that the CEG's objectives were as follows:\n\" - to reduce the costs of granting authorization and link them to CEG members' actual volume of sales,\n- to combat fraudulent practices of which the user is the victim,\n- to obtain for CEG members preferential treatment over non-members (appliances sold by non-members may not bear the authorization label, but they may, of course, have their appliances authorized by ANSEAU).\n\"\nThe following conclusion was drawn : \"The consequence would be that if a water company found a machine without a label connected to its supply system, it could go so far as to cut off the water supply to the user concerned.\"\n23. The text of the Agreement was finalized at meetings on 10 and 13 October 1978 between the representatives of the CEG, the FCAE, UFARAL and ANSEAU. The amendment to Article 4.1 of the Agreement must be emphasized. The text proposed by ANSEAU was as follows : \"It is provided, moreover, that other parties may accede to this Agreement, provided that the CEG shall have sole power of decision in the matter, and subject to the express condition that such other parties shall also be bound by all the terms of this Agreement and shall recognize the CEG as their representative.\"\nAfter \"accede to this Agreement\", the following phrase was added : \"provided that they are also manufacturers or sole importers\".\n24. On 23 October 1978, a joint meeting of the two CEG groups, Laundry Care and Dishwashers, was held, at which the FCAE and UFARAL were represented. The following statements were made by the CEG during this meeting: - \"ANSEAU has now decided to recognize only its own label (conformity label) as proof that a washing machine or dishwasher conforms to its rules, its main objective being to avoid pollution of the water supply.\"\n- \"ANSEAU will inform the general public of this label through inter alia a press conference, leaflets inserted with statements of account and any other appropriate means of promotion.\"\n- \"ANSEAU will cease to publish the lists of authorized appliances which it has published hitherto and the label alone will certify that the appliance conforms to its rules.\"\n- \"There is no question of replacing the system that has been devised with any prohibitions on imports of equipment which does not conform to the ANSEAU rules, which is not within its power or ours ; moreover, the Treaty of Rome, in fact, prohibits technical barriers to trade.\"\n- \"There is no other alternative for resolving the problem of authorization : there is either the old system which is expensive and unproductive ... or the proposed Agreement. The Agreement has the advantage of providing a weapon - albeit imperfect, but by no means negligible - against parallel imports : the CEG, which alone is authorized to issue conformity labels, will do so only to official sole importers.\"\n25. The draft Agreement received overwhelming approval at the end of that meeting, with the exception of two participants ; Indesit and Philips, who had reservations with regard to the technical problems posed by the affixing of labels at the time of manufacture and the higher cost of using the labels for firms which sold a large number of machines from a restricted range of types. The final text of the Agreement was adopted at a meeting on 26 October 1978 between the representatives of the CEG, the FCAE, UFARAL and ANSEAU. It was stressed at the meeting that the new system would have the following advantage:\n\"We are convinced that, thanks to the publicity campaign which both parties will undertake to recommend that customers, in their own interest, should buy henceforth only machines that conform to the rules (i.e. those bearing the conformity label), the sales of other machines will drop, even if they fulfil the requirements of the ANSEAU rules.\"\n26. 26. The final text of the Agreement was communicated prior to its being signed to all the firms referred to in Annex I to this Decision ; on the date of signature of the Agreement, 13 December 1978, all those firms, with the exception of the Despagne company, took part in a meeting to clarify certain points and the practical implementation of the Agreement.\nF. Implementation of the Agreement 27. The implementation of the Agreement was accompanied by a major publicity campaign undertaken by the firms comprising the first party to the Agreement and by ANSEAU. Advertisements warned consumers against purchasing machines which did not bear the conformity label ; some advertisements stated that machines without the ANSEAU label might entail heavy inspection costs and even temporary disconnection from the water supply.\n28. The CEG, which alone is authorized to issue the conformity labels, strictly applied the provisions of the Agreement stating that only manufacturers or sole importers may accede to the Agreement (Article 4.1). The standard letter sent by the CEG to dealers who ask what procedure must be followed in order to obtain the NAVEWA-ANSEAU conformity labels includes the following provisions: - \"You are requested ...\n- (c) to confirm your status as sole importer for the Belgian market, specifying the brand(s) and type(s) of washing machines and/or dishwashers concerned;\n- (d) to forward the certificate from your supplier(s) officially recognizing you as the sole importer, as referred to in (c) above\".\n29. The standard letter was sent on 30 April 1979 in answer to request from S.A. Frabelmar in Ransart (a \"CORA\" store), who stated that the company imported Indesit washing machines direct from Italy. The CEG sent copies of Frabelmar's request and its reply to the head office of Indesit-Belgique to enable it, in the words of the covering letter, to \"defend itself, armed with proof, against at least one of its parallel importers\".\n30. The same letter was sent on 8 August 1979 to Snack en Grootkeukenmateriaal, Koffiebranderij, CRES in Ghent. In its reply of 18 September 1979, the company stated that, in order to obtain information on the procedure to be followed, it had had to apply first to its local water-supply company, then to ANSEAU which had referred it to the CEG, which in turn informed the company that it must first contact UFARAL, since the equipment in question was for industrial catering. The CEG subsequently stated in its letter of 20 September 1979 that the stock of labels had in any event been used up by the firms which had been using them regularly since December 1978 and that it was waiting for further applications before reprinting them to meet requirements up to the end of 1980.\n31. ANSEAU also played an active part in monitoring the implementation of the new system. It was stated at a meeting on 30 October 1979 between the manufacturers and distributors of washing machines and dishwashers and ANSEAU : \"The market is being intensively monitored by ANSEAU in both shops and exhibitions and trade fairs\". Where one or more of the machines displayed does not bear the conformity label, ANSEAU sends the dealer concerned a registered letter listing the machines which do not bear conformity labels and stating : \"We should like to draw your attention in particular to the fact that these machines therefore do not meet the requirements for connection to the water-supply system, which are designed to prevent any contamination or pollution of drinking water. Machines which bear the conformity label are certified as conforming to those requirements. In order to avoid any inconvenience to your customers, we would therefore advise you to request your supplier to remedy this situation without delay\".\n32. A letter on these lines was sent on 25 July 1979 to the CAMPO company in Antwerp. It should be noted that approximately half of the machines which are referred to as not conforming to the requirements (that is, which do not bear the conformity label) appear in the list of machines that conform to the requirements, published by ANSEAU on 15 January 1979.\n33. ANSEAU also answers applications from foreign manufacturers or dealers who wish to export products to Belgium. In its letter of 5 November 1979 to Mr Mario Allieri, an Italian dealer who wanted to know what technical requirements had to be met before washing machines and dishwashers could be exported to Belgium, ANSEAU made the following statements:\n\"It should be noted that you are an exporter and not an importer ; it is essential, therefore, that one of the people with whom you propose to conclude an agreement be appointed by you as the sole importer for Belgium of your make of machines. That person will then fulfil the necessary requirements for membership of the Communauté de l'Electricité (CEG) ..., which acts on behalf of all the manufacturers and importers concerned.\"\n34. Finally, the local water services also carry out checks on users' premises to verify whether the machines installed are on the list of machines that conform to the rules or bear the conformity label. If neither of these requirements is met, the user is advised by letter that, within a period of three months, he must submit a detailed technical plan of the machine's complete hydraulic circuit and permit the water service to make the necessary checks on the machine, for which purpose partial dismantling of the machine must be carried out by the user himself. The user is advised that he may call upon the dealer, manufacturer or importer of the machine for that purpose.\n35. Some manufacturers of washing machines and dishwashers established outside Belgium to whom such a letter had been transmitted told the Commission that they had been induced thereby to appoint a sole importer in Belgium.\n36. Where the conformity check cannot be carried out within the prescribed period, the water service sends a registered letter instructing the user to disconnect the machine in question until it has been possible for the check to be made.\nII. LEGAL ASSESSMENT\nA. Article 85 (1) of the EEC Treaty\n37. The manufacturers and sole importers affiliated to the CEG, the FCAE and the UFARAL, who constitute the first party to the Agreement, are undertakings within the meaning of Article 85 (1). The water supply companies and services affiliated to ANSEAU which constitute the second party to the Agreement are undertakings within the meaning of that Article. The Agreement thus constitutes an agreement between undertakings and an association of undertakings.\n38. Although Article 85 (1) refers only to agreements between undertakings, it also concerns agreements between associations of undertakings. The Court of Justice held in Case 67/63, SOREMA v. High Authority, [1964] ECR 151, that Article 65 of the ECSC Treaty, the terms of which are the same, as regards this point, as those of Article 85 of the EEC Treaty, applied to an agreement concluded by an association of undertakings. The Court reaffirmed this interpretation with regard to Article 85 of the EEC Treaty in Case 71/74, FRUBO v. Commission [1975] ECR 583, in which it held that Article 85 (1) applies to associations in so far as their own activity or that of their members tends to produce the effects which the Article covers.\n39. The Agreement is an agreement which, through ANSEAU, also binds its members. Although ANSEAU does not have the formal power to impose rules on its members, but only to recommend that they implement the rules, the Agreement is in fact binding on the members of ANSEAU. Since the Agreement abolished, in respect of machines manufactured after 31 January 1979, the old system for checking conformity based on a list of authorized appliances, water-supply companies are obliged to recognize the NAVEWA-ANSEAU label as proof of conformity, in order to comply with their statutory obligations as regards water quality control. They would otherwise have to carry out conformity checks on an individual basis, on all washing machines and dishwashers sold in Belgium, which is impossible in practice.\n40. According to its provisions, the purpose of the Agreement is \"to prevent, in the interests of public health, any deterioration in the quality of the water supplied due to contamination or pollution, particularly when washing machines or dishwashers are connected to the drinking-water supply.\"\n41. Both the text of the Agreement and the way in which it is implemented make it clear for the following reasons that, in addition to its formal purpose, it is also the object of the Agreement to prevent competition within the common market within the meaning of Article 85 (1).\n(a) The NAVEWA-ANSEAU conformity label replaced the earlier system for checking conformity, based on the lists of authorized appliances\n42. ANSEAU does not dispute that, while lists of appliances that conform to the rules still exist, they concern only appliances which were manufactured prior to 31 January 1979, as is, moreover, provided in Article 6 of the special rules annexed to the Agreement, which state that the Agreement applies to all machines bearing a manufacturer's serial number issued subsequently.\n43. The only means of checking the conformity of equipment manufactured after 31 January 1979, apart from the affixing of the conformity label, is the examination by ANSEAU or its members of each machine connected to the water supply. The machines must be approved on an individual basis, and approval cannot be given on the basis of the type of machine, since there is no provision for informing all the water-supply companies that a type of equipment has been recognized as conforming to the rules. The cost of this type of examination is disproportionate by comparison with the cost of the checks carried out pursuant to the Agreement (approximately Bfrs 10 000 for each examination).\n44. The terms of the Agreement indicate, moreover, that even this possibility does not exist. It is clear from Article 8.2 of the Agreement that the purpose of the Agreement is to eliminate any possibility of providing proof of conformity other than by the affixing of the label. The general nature of the terms used invalidates unequivocally the argument put forward by the parties to the Agreement that the affixing of the label is only a specific means of carrying out the inspection of washing machines and dishwashers and concerns only machines marketed by manufacturers or sole importers. The abovementioned provision covers checks carried out on premises of all dealers, regardless of the origin of the machines.\n45. In practice, ANSEAU sends a letter indicating that certain machines which do not bear the conformity label therefore do not meet the conformity requirements even in the case of machines that are on the list of machines which conform to the requirements (cf. the letter sent to CAMPO, points 31 and 32 above). ANSEAU also delegates to its members the task of carrying out checks on dealers' premises.\n46. As regards machines already installed on consumers' premises, the local water companies are responsible for checking machines which do not bear the conformity label. For the purpose of such checks, consumers are required to provide a technical plan of the hydraulic circuit and to undertake the partial dismantling of the machine.\n47. The dissuasive effect of these measures was reinforced by the publicity campaign by ANSEAU and the other parties to the Agreement to encourage consumers to buy only machines bearing the conformity label and stressing the disadvantages which might result from purchasing machines which do not bear the label (cf. point 27). Such measures make it difficult if not impossible to sell machines which do not bear the label in Belgium, even where they meet the technical requirements regarding conformity laid down by ANSEAU.\n(b) Only manufacturers or sole importers may obtain the conformity labels\n48. Article 2 of the Agreement states that it governs the use of the NAVEWA-ANSEAU conformity label for washing machines and dishwashers. This general provision precludes anyone other than the signatories of the Agreement from obtaining the said labels. Under Article 1 only manufacturers and sole importers may be signatories. Article 4.1 of the Agreement provides that other parties may accede to the Agreement \"provided that they are also manufacturers or sole importers and that the CEG shall have the sole power of decision in the matter ...\".\n49. The CEG strictly controls the implementation of that provision by requiring firms wishing to obtain conformity labels to confirm their status as sole importers and to forward a certificate from their supplier officially recognizing them as sole importer (cf. point 28).\n50. ANSEAU indicates to firms which request information from it that the labels may be issued only to sole importers and even that the latter must be members of the CEG (cf. the letter to Mr Allieri, point 33 above). Apart from the direct measures taken by ANSEAU, the discriminatory nature of the checks made on machines which can not qualify under the provisions of the Agreement has induced some foreign manufacturers to appoint sole importers in Belgium (cf. point 35 above).\n51. The argument advanced by certain parties to the Agreement that some of them were not manufacturers or sole importers merely indicates that the Agreement has not been properly implemented and does not eliminate the Agreement's object of restricting competition. Moreover, it invalidates the argument that the Agreement can be extended only to other manufacturers or sole importers since they alone provide adequate guarantees.\n52. The fact was not disputed that, except for the specific instance of industrial catering equipment, dealers who were not manufacturers or sole importers could obtain the conformity label only through the manufacturer or sole importer.\n(c) The conformity labels are distributed solely by the CEG, which is authorized for that purpose by all the contracting parties\n53. This condition, laid down in Article 5, and the more general requirement that new parties to the Agreement must recognize the CEG as their representative (last sentence of Article 4.1) reinforce the restrictive object of the Agreement, since it is possible to obtain the conformity labels only on the basis of the provisions of the Agreement. Even if the clause excluding importers other than sole importers were deleted, they would still be able to obtain the conformity labels only through the CEG. This requirement enables an organization comprising only manufacturers and sole importers to check on the sales of importers who are not sole importers.\n54. As regards industrial catering equipment, even though UFARAL states that it is authorized by the CEG to distribute the relevant labels, the fact remains that no distinction is made in the Agreement, and the CEG's exclusive right to distribute the labels applies equally to that type of equipment. In any event, the CEG is still able, in delegating this power, to check on who has the labels and determine whether the applicants are in fact manufacturers or sole importers, by virtue of Article 4.1 of the Agreement. The fact that UFARAL may also distribute labels does not eliminate the restriction, since importers who are not members of UFARAL will normally apply to the CEG.\n55. The fact that the technical data on new or modified machines must be forwarded to ANSEAU \"via the CEG\" (Article 6 of the Agreement) also reinforces the restrictive object of the Agreement.\n56. The combined effect of the provisions of the Agreement mentioned at points 42 to 55 above is that for washing machines and dishwashers imported into Belgium by importers other than sole importers the checking of conformity to ANSEAU requirements is carried out under conditions which discriminate against them by comparison with those which apply to sole importers and manufacturers established in Belgium. The only possibility for importers other than sole importers to obtain the conformity labels is to apply to the sole importer concerned. In the event of a refusal, they or the dealer must then have each machine individually examined, which is prohibitively expensive by comparison with the selling price of the machines. These provisions thus enable sole importers to check parallel imports and to take any other restrictive measures to prevent them (cf. point 29 above).\n57. As regards industrial equipment, the restriction is not eliminated by virtue of the fact that the pattern of demand makes parallel imports difficult. The establishment of discriminatory conditions for authorization in respect of machines imported by importers other than sole importers is directed at all equipment imported by dealers who are able to provide customers with high-quality service but to whom the manufacturer does not wish to grant an exclusive dealing agreement, perhaps because of his selling policy. By tending to make the appointment of sole importers obligatory, while, according to UFARAL, the manufacturers do not pursue an exclusive distribution policy in this sector, the Agreement also restricts competition in this sector by its effect on the pattern of supply.\n58. Therefore, the provisions of the Agreement excluding the possibility for importers other than sole importers to obtain a conformity check for the machines which they import into Belgium under conditions which are not discriminatory in comparison with those applying to sole importers and manufacturers constitute restrictions of competition within the meaning of Article 85 (1) of the Treaty.\n59. These restrictions may affect trade between Member States, since the establishment of discriminatory conditions for the authorization of machines imported by importers other than sole importers may affect trade between the Member States in a manner prejudicial to the attainment of the objectives of a single market. They strengthen the exclusivity granted to sole importers in that they tend to exclude the possibility of other patterns of trade in the relevant products by way of parallel imports.\n60. The Agreement restricts competition and may affect trade between Member States appreciably, not only because of the nature of the restrictions which it contains but also because it concerns all washing machines and dishwashers sold in Belgium and most of these machines are imported from other common market countries.\nB. Article 85 (3) of the EEC Treaty\n61. Before a decision can be taken granting exemption under Article 85 (3), the Agreement must have been notified to the Commission in accordance with Articles 4 (1) or 5 (1) of Regulation No 17, except where this requirement does not apply, pursuant to Articles 4 (2) or 5 (2) of that Regulation.\n62. The Agreement was not notified to the Commission and it is not covered by the exceptions provided for in Article 4 (2) of Regulation No 17. The argument advanced by certain parties to the Agreement that the Agreement is exempt from the requirement of notification on the basis of point (1) of Article 4 (2) of the Regulation is not acceptable. Point (1) provides that \"paragraph 1 shall not apply to agreements ... where the only parties thereto are undertakings from one Member State and the agreements, decisions or practices do not relate either to imports or to exports between Member States\". As the Court of Justice stated in the case Fonderies Roubaix-Wattrelos of 3 February 1976 (Case 63/75, [1976] ECR 111) : \"This second condition must be interpreted with reference to the structure of Article 4 and its aim of simplifying administrative procedure, which it pursues by not requiring undertakings to notify agreements which, whilst they may be covered by Article 85 (1), appear in general, by reason of their peculiar characteristics, to be less harmful from the point of view of the objectives of this provision and which are therefore very likely to be entitled to the benefit of Article 85 (3).\" In the present case, the Agreement restricts the right to obtain the conformity labels to manufacturers and sole importers (the latter forming the great majority of the parties to the Agreement) and may not benefit from any presumed application of Article 85 (3). Therefore the Agreement relates to imports and exports between Member States within the meaning of Article 4 (2) of Regulation No 17.\n63. In any event, even if the Agreement had been notified, the exemption provided for in Article 85 (3) could not be granted, since the barriers to parallel imports tend to isolate the Belgian market in a manner incompatible with the basic principles of the common market. Moreover, while the Agreement may enable the quality of the water supply to be guaranteed, the provisions restricting competition referred to above are certainly not indispensable to that guarantee. There is also no reason to suppose that these provisions may benefit consumers.\nC. Article 90 (2) of the EEC Treaty\n64. Certain parties to the Agreement claimed that the prohibition under Article 85 does not apply to the Agreement by virtue of Article 90 (2) of the Treaty, since the members of ANSEAU are undertakings entrusted with the operation of services of general economic interest, within the meaning of that Article, and the application of the prohibition would obstruct the performance, in law or in fact, of the particular task assigned to them.\n65. The water-supply companies which are members of ANSEAU and which were set up by the public authorities in order to secure regular supply and distribution of water under conditions which fully guarantee the protection of public health are undertakings entrusted with the operation of services of general economic interest, within the meaning of that Article.\n66. Such undertakings are exempt from the requirement of compliance with the rules on competition only in so far as the application of such rules would obstruct the performance, in law or in fact, of the particular task assigned to them. It is not sufficient in this regard that compliance with the provisions of the Treaty makes the performance of the particular task more complicated. A possible limitation of the application of the rules on competition can be envisaged only in the event that the undertaking concerned has no other technically and economically feasible means of performing its particular task.\n67. In the case in point, the establishment of discriminatory conditions for the authorization of machines imported by importers other than sole importers was not necessary, let alone indispensable, to enable the companies which are members of ANSEAU to perform the task assigned to them. The fact of making it possible for importers other than sole importers to obtain labels on non-discriminatory terms, direct from ANSEAU, could not in any case have obstructed the performance of that task. Article 90 (2) does not, therefore, preclude the application of the prohibition under Article 85 to the said provisions of the Agreement, and there is no need to examine whether the development of trade was likely to be affected to such an extent as would be contrary to the interests of the Community.\nD. Article 3 (1) of Regulation No 17\n68. It is clear from the foregoing considerations that the parties to the Agreement have infringed Article 85 of the EEC Treaty. After receiving the statement of objections, they signified their intention to amend the Agreement, but so far as the Commission is aware they have not in fact done so. Therefore these infringements are still current.\n69. It is, therefore, necessary, pursuant to Article 3 of Regulation No 17, to require the parties to the Agreement to bring these infringements to an end forthwith by amending the Agreement in such a way that it does not prevent importers other than sole importers from obtaining the NAVEWA-ANSEAU conformity labels directly. It is also necessary to require ANSEAU to take all the measures necessary to ensure that such importers may obtain the labels direct from ANSEAU itself, without having to recognize the CEG as their representative, and on non-discriminatory terms by comparison with these granted to manufacturers and sole importers. Those measures must be adequately publicized. The amendments to the Agreement and the measures taken by ANSEAU must be communicated to the Commission within two months of the notification of this Decision.\nE. Article 15 (2) of Regulation No 17\n70. The parties to the Agreement have acted in breach of Article 85 since 1 January 1979 in the case of the original signatories and since the date of their accession to the Agreement in the case of the others. The infringements are still current, as is shown at point 68 above.\n71. It is well known that the Community authorities regularly institute proceedings and impose penalties in respect of measures adopted by undertakings to prevent parallel imports and establish artificial barriers within the European Community, thereby prejudicing the unity of the common market. In the present case, restrictions on parallel imports based on a contractual system of checking conformity with technical requirements are serious infringements of Article 85, since the system is binding upon third parties.\n72. It is, moreover, apparent from the statement of the facts that the undertakings which participated in the drawing-up of the Agreement, namely those referred to in Annex I to this Decision, committed these infringements deliberately, because they were aware of the anti-competitive object of the Agreement. Indeed, the chairmen of the two CEG groups, Laundry Care and Dishwashers, stated on 19 September 1978 that one of the aims of the CEG was to obtain for its members preferential treatment over non-members, who had to have their machines individually checked by ANSEAU, while only the members of the CEG could use the conformity label. The CEG, moreover, stated unequivocally at the meeting on 23 October 1978 that the Agreement had the advantage of constituting a weapon against parallel imports. The responsibility of these undertakings results, on the one hand, from their participation in the drawing-up of the Agreement and, on the other hand, from their status as CEG members, because of the active part taken by the latter in the drawing-up and enforcement of the Agreement.\n73. Therefore it is appropriate that fines should be imposed under Article 15 (2) of Regulation No 17 on the undertakings which took part in the drawing-up of the Agreement. It must be noted that, because of their participation in the drawing-up of the Agreement and their status as CEG members, all these undertakings bear the same responsibility. Moreover, the amounts of the fines imposed upon them must take into account the particular context in which the infringement was committed and the individual positions of those undertakings on the relevant market.\n74. On the other hand, the undertakings which became parties to the Agreement after its signature, namely those referred to in Annex II to this Decision, took no initiative in the drawing-up of the Agreement and were practically obliged to participate. Therefore no fine should be imposed upon them.\n75. It must also be noted that the most important part of the responsibility for the infringement lies with ANSEAU. The fact that the members of ANSEAU are entrusted by the public authorities with the operation of services of general economic interest made it possible to present the Agreement as being an obligatory agreement and thus to give it binding force vis-à-vis third parties who were not party to the Agreement. ANSEAU should, therefore, have paid particular attention to ensuring that the system instituted for checking the conformity of washing-machines and dishwashers could not be anti-competitive and discriminatory. ANSEAU did allow the Agreement to have such an objective, even though its group of legal experts had drawn its attention to the fact that the Agreement made it possible to check 90 % of production and that a solution must be found to enable the conformity labels to be made available to the remaining 10 %, which was never done. Moreover, ANSEAU and the representatives of the CEG, the FCAE and UFARAL were present at the meeting on 26 October 1978, at which the participants stated that, thanks to the publicity campaign which would be undertaken to encourage consumers to purchase only machines bearing the conformity label, the sales of other machines would drop, even those which conformed to the ANSEAU rules. Therefore ANSEAU committed the infringements through gross negligence.\n76. It is therefore also appropriate to impose a fine on ANSEAU pursuant to Article 15 (2) of Regulation No 17. Although ANSEAU bears the most important part of the responsibility, as it is a non-profit-making body, the fine must be equal in amount to the largest fines imposed on the undertakings which took part in the drawing-up of the Agreement,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\nArticle 1\nThe provisions of the Agreement concerning the use of the NAVEWA-ANSEAU conformity label concluded on 13 December 1978 in Brussels, Belgium, excluding the possibility for importers other than sole importers to obtain a conformity check for the washing-machines and dishwashers which they import into Belgium under conditions which are not discriminatory by comparison with those which apply to manufacturers and sole importers, constitute infringements of Article 85 (1) of the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community. This applies in particular to Articles 2, 4.1, 5 and 6 of the said Agreement and to Article 6 of the special rules annexed to that Agreement.\nArticle 2\nThe parties to the Agreement shall forthwith bring to an end the infringements established in Article 1. They shall inform the Commission within two months of the notification of this Decision of the measures taken in this regard.\nArticle 3\n1.

If, as the result of a sudden change in the supply of crude oil or petroleum products, it becomes difficult for a Member State to apply the limit on the maximum lead content of leaded petrol, that Member State may, after having informed the Commission, authorize a higher limit within its territory for a period of four months. The Council, acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, may extend this period.\n3. Member States shall, as soon as they consider it appropriate, reduce to 0,15 g Pb/litre the permitted lead-compound content, calculated in terms of lead, of leaded petrol put on their markets.\n4. Member States may prohibit the marketing in their territory of leaded petrol having a motor octane number (MON) lower than 85 at the pump and a research octane number (RON) lower than 95 at the pump if such a measure is justified on grounds of the protection of human health and the environment and promotes the availability and balanced distribution of unleaded petrol within their territory in accordance with Article 3 (1).\n5. If a Member State introduces into its rules the prohibition referred to in paragraph 4, it shall give at least six months' notice to the Commission and to the public. The Commission shall immediately inform the other Member States.

whereas the revenue of the Office should in principle be sufficient to balance the budget of the Office; whereas such revenues should be afforded by the fees to be paid for the official acts set out in the Basic Regulation and in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1239/95 of 31 May 1995 establishing implementing rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 2100/94 as regards proceedings before the Community Plant Variety Office (2) (the Proceedings Regulation) as well as by annual fees payable for the duration of a Community plant variety right;\nWhereas a subsidy from the general budget of the European Communities may cover the expenditure on the initial running phase of the Office for the transitional period defined in Article 113 (3) (b) of the Regulation; whereas an extension of that period by one year is possible by virtue of the same provision;\nWhereas such extension of the transitional period should be considered if sufficient experience has not been gained for setting reasonable levels of fees ensuring the principle of self-financing whilst safeguarding the attractiveness of the Community system of plant variety protection; whereas such experience could only be gained by observing the number of applications for a Community plant variety right, the costs paid to the Examination Offices and the actual duration of Community plant variety rights granted;\nWhereas the level of the fees should be based on the principles of sound financial management within the Office, and in particular economy and cost-effectiveness;\nWhereas, in the interests of a simplified handling by the staff of the Office, the fees should be not only laid down, but also charged and paid in the same currency unit as is used for the budget of the Office;\nWhereas the application fee should be a uniform fee covering only the processing of an application for a Community plant variety right made in respect of any given plant species;\nWhereas the time limit for the payment of the application fee under Article 51 of the Basic Regulation should be considered as the period between the acts necessary for making the payment and the actual receipt of such payment by the Office, in particular in the need for a rapid recovery of costs already incurred by the Office on the one hand and for the facilitating of an effective filing of applications in the light of possibly long distances between applicant and Office, on the other;\nWhereas the total of the examination fees which are charged for a technical examination should, in principle, balance the total fees to be paid by the Office to all Examination Offices; whereas costs for the maintenance of the reference collection should not necessarily be covered entirely by the examination fees charged; whereas the level of examination fee should vary between three groups of plant species in the light of experience available from existing national arrangements for plant variety protection;\nWhereas the annual fees for the duration of a Community plant variety right should constitute an extra source of revenue for the Office, but should, inter alia, cover costs relating to the technical verification of varieties after the grant of a Community plant variety right and, in consequence, should follow the grouping established for the examination fees;\nWhereas the appeal fee should be uniform in order to cover the main cost components relating to appeal proceedings, with the expection of costs relating to a technical examination pursuant to Articles 55 and 56 of the Basic Regulation or to any taking of evidence; whereas two different dates for payment of the application free should serve as an incentive to appellants to reconsider their appeal in the light of the decisions taken by the Office pursuant to Article 70 (2) of the Basic Regulation;\nWhereas other fees in respect of specific requests shall in principle cover costs incurred in their processing by the Office, including the taking of decisions on such requests;\nWhereas to ensure flexibility in the management of costs, the President of the Office should be empowered to lay down the fees payable for examination reports which already exist at the date of application and are not available to the Office, and for specific services rendered;\nWhereas surcharges may be levied in order to reduce unnecessary costs to the Office arising from a lack of cooperation on the part of particular applicants for, or holders of, Community plant variety rights;\nWhereas in the light of Article 117 of the Basic Regulation, this Regulation should enter into force as soon as possible;\nWhereas the Administrative Council of the Office has been consulted;\nWhereas the provisions provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Variety Rights,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nScope\n1. Fees due to the Office, as provided for in the Basic Regulation and the Proceedings Regulation, shall be charged in accordance with this Regulation.\n2. The fees due to the Office shall be laid down, charged and paid in ecus.\n3. Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall apply mutatis mutandis to any surcharge, due to the Office.\n4. Details of the fees which may be charged by authorities of Member States by virtue of provisions of the Basic Regulation or this Regulation shall be governed by the relevant national rules of the Member States concerned.\n5. Where the President of the Office is empowered to take a decision as to the amount of fees and the way in which they are to be paid, such decisions shall be published in the Official Gazette of the Office.\nArticle 2\nGeneral provisions\n1. For each individual matter, a party to proceedings as specified in the Proceedings Regulation shall be liable to pay fees or surcharges. In the case of several parties to proceedings acting in common or on whose behalf a common course of action is pursued, each shall be liable to such payment as joint debtor.\n2. Unless otherwise provided in this Regulation, the provisions relating to proceedings before the Office, including provisions as to languages, as laid down in the Basic Regulation and the Proceedings Regulation, shall apply.\nArticle 3\nManner of payment\n1. Fees and surcharges due to the Office shall be paid by transfer to a bank account held by the Office.\n2. The President of the Office may allow the following alternative forms of payment in accordance with rules on working methods which shall be established pursuant to Article 36 (1) (d) of the Basic Regulation:\n(a) delivery or remittance of certified cheques which are made payable in ecus to the Office;\n(b) transfer in ecus to a giro account held by the Office; or (c) payment into a charge account held in ecus with the Office.\nArticle 4\nDate to be regarded as the date on which payment is received\n1. The date on which a payment of fees and surcharges shall be considered to have been received by the Office shall be the date on which the amount of the transfer referred to in Article 3 (1) is entered in a bank account held by the Office.\n2. Where the President of the Office allows other forms of payment in accordance with Article 3 (2), he shall simultaneously include in the conditions the date to be regarded as the date on which the payment is received.\n3. Where the payment is considered not to have been received by the Office within the requisite time limit, such time limit shall be considered to have been observed vis-à-vis the Office if sufficient documentary evidence is produced within that time-limit to show that the person who made the payment took necessary steps.\n4. It shall be considered to be 'necessary` within the meaning of paragraph 3 if the person making the payment duly gave an order to a banking establishment or a post office to transfer the amount of the payment in ecus to a bank account held by the Office.\n5. Documentary evidence shall be regarded as 'sufficient` within the meaning of paragraph 3 if an acknowledgement of provision of the transfer order, issued by a banking establishment or a post office, is produced.\nArticle 5\nName of the person making the payment and the purpose of payment\n1. A person making a payment of fees or surcharges shall indicate in writing his name and the purpose of such payment.\n2. If the Office cannot establish the purpose of a payment, it shall require the person having made the payment to inform it thereof in writing within two months. If the purpose is not indicated within that period, the payment shall be deemed not to have been made and shall be refunded to the person having made it.\nArticle 6\nUnderpayment\nA time-limit for payment of fees or surcharges shall, in principle, be deemed to have been observed only if the full amount of the fee or surcharge has been paid in due time. If the fees or surcharges are not paid in full, the amount which has been paid shall be refunded after any time-limit for payment has expired. The Office may, however, where this is considered justified, overlook any small deficiencies, without prejudicing the rights of the person making the payment.\nArticle 7\nApplication fee\n1. The applicant for a Community plant variety right (the applicant) shall pay an application fee of ECU 1 000 for the processing of the application under Article 113 (2) (a) of the Basic Regulation.\n2.

            "text": "Regulation (EC) No 450/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council\nof 27 February 2003\nconcerning the labour cost index\n(Text with EEA relevance)\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 285(1) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee(2),\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Central Bank(3),\nActing in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty(4),\nWhereas:\n(1) A range of statistics, of which labour cost indices form an essential part, is relevant for an understanding of the inflationary process and the dynamics of the labour market.\n(2) The Community, and particularly its economic, employment and monetary authorities, need to have regular and timely labour cost indices for the purpose of monitoring changes in labour costs.\n(3) The Action Plan on Economic and Monetary Union statistical requirements, produced by the European Commission (Eurostat) in close collaboration with the European Central Bank, identifies as a priority the development of a legal basis covering short-term labour cost statistics.\n(4) The benefits of collecting, at Community level, complete data on all segments of the economy should be balanced against the reporting possibilities and the response burden on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).\n(5) The Regulation is in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. The creation of common statistical standards for labour cost indices can only be achieved on the basis of a Community legal act because only the Commission can coordinate the necessary harmonisation of statistical information at Community level, while the collection of data and compilation of comparable labour cost indices can be organised by the Member States.\n(6) Council Regulation (EC) No 322/97 of 17 February 1997 on Community statistics(5) provides the general framework for the production of labour cost indices under this Regulation.\n(7) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(6).\n(8) The Statistical Programme Committee (SPC), established by Council Decision 89/382/EEC, Euratom(7), has been consulted in accordance with Article 3 of that Decision,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nObjective\nThe objective of this Regulation is to establish a common framework for the production, transmission and evaluation of comparable labour cost indices in the Community. Member States shall produce labour cost indices for the economic activities defined in Article 4.\nArticle 2\nDefinitions\n1. The labour cost index (LCI) is defined as the Laspeyres index of labour costs per hour worked, chain linked annually and based upon a fixed structure of economic activity at NACE Rev.1 section level, where NACE Rev.1 is the classification established by Council Regulation (EEC) No 3037/90 of 9 October 1990 on the statistical classification of economic activities in the European Community(8). Further disaggregations of NACE Rev.1 sections, to be included in the fixed structure, shall be defined in accordance with Article 4(1). The formula to be used for the calculation of the LCI is defined in the Annex to this Regulation.\n2. The labour costs are the total quarterly costs incurred by the employer in the employment of labour. The labour cost items and total staff employed are defined by reference to Annex II, Sections A and D (items D.1, D.4 and D.5 and their subcomponents, excluding items D.2 and D.3) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1726/1999 of 27 July 1999 implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 530/1999 concerning structural statistics on earnings and on labour costs as regards the definition and transmission of information on labour costs(9).\n3. The hours worked are defined by reference to Council Regulation (EC) No 2223/96 of 25 June 1996 on the European system of national and regional accounts in the Community(10), Annex A, Chapter 11, paragraphs 11.26 to 11.31.\n4. Technical specification of the index, including revisions to the weighting structure, can be redefined in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 12(2).\nArticle 3\nScope\n1. This Regulation shall apply to all activities defined in sections C to O of NACE Rev.1.\n2. The inclusion of economic activities defined by NACE Rev.1 sections L, M, N and O in the scope of this Regulation shall be determined in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 12(2), taking into account the feasibility studies defined in Article 10.\n3. The LCI shall represent all statistical units as defined in Council Regulation (EEC) No 696/93 of 15 March 1993 on the statistical units for the observation and analysis of the production system in the Community(11).\nArticle 4\nBreakdown of variables\n1. The data shall be broken down by economic activities defined by NACE Rev.1 sections and by further disaggregations, not beyond the level of NACE Rev.1 divisions (2 digit level) or groupings of divisions, taking account of contributions to total employment and to labour costs at Community and national levels, defined in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 12(2). Labour cost indices shall be provided separately for the three labour cost categories identified below:\n(a) total labour costs;\n(b) wages and salaries, defined by reference to item D.11 in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1726/1999;\n(c) employers' social contributions plus taxes paid by the employer less subsidies received by the employer, as defined by the sum of items D.12 and D.4 less D.5 in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1726/1999.\n2. An index estimating total labour costs, excluding bonuses, where bonuses are defined by D.11112 in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1726/1999, shall be provided, broken down by economic activities defined in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 12(2), and shall be based on the NACE Rev.1 classification, taking into account the feasibility studies defined in Article 10.\nArticle 5\nFrequency and back data\n1. The data for the LCI shall first be compiled for the first quarter of 2003, and thereafter for each quarter (ending on 31 March, 30 June, 30 September and 31 December of each year).\n2. Back data covering the period from the first quarter of 1996 to the fourth quarter of 2002 shall be made available by the Member States. The back data shall be provided for each of the NACE Rev.1 sections C to K and for the labour cost items mentioned in Article 4(1).\nArticle 6\nTransmission of results\n1. The data referred to in Article 4 shall be supplied in index form. The weights used to calculate the index, defined in the Annex to this Regulation, shall be made available for publication at the same time.\nThe appropriate technical format to be used for the transmission of the results referred to in Article 4, and the adjustment procedures to be applied to the data shall be defined in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 12(2).\n2. Member States shall transmit the data, broken down as specified in Article 4, to the Commission (Eurostat) within 70 days of the end of the reference period. Metadata, defined as the explanations needed to interpret the changes in the data either arising from methodological or technical changes, or due to changes in the labour market, shall be delivered with the data.\n3. The back data referred to in Article 5 shall be transmitted to the Commission (Eurostat) at the same time as the LCI for the first quarter of 2003.\nArticle 7\nSources\nMember States may produce the necessary estimates by using a combination of different sources specified below by applying the principle of administrative simplification:\n(a) surveys, where statistical units, as defined in Regulation (EEC) No 696/93, are asked to give timely, accurate and complete information;\n(b) other appropriate sources, including administrative data if these are appropriate in terms of timeliness and relevance;\n(c) appropriate statistical estimation procedures.\nArticle 8\nQuality\n1. The current data and back data transmitted shall satisfy separate quality criteria to be defined under the procedure referred to in Article 12(2).\n2. The Member States shall provide annual quality reports to the Commission, beginning in 2003. The content of the reports shall be defined under the procedure referred to in Article 12(2).\nArticle 9\nTransition periods and derogations\n1. Transition periods relating to the implementation of this Regulation may be granted under the procedure referred to in Article 12(2), not extending more than two years from the date of entry into force of this Regulation.\n2. During the transition periods, derogations from this Regulation may be accepted by the Commission insofar as the national statistical systems require major adaptations.\nArticle 10\nFeasibility studies\n1. The Commission shall, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 12(2), institute a series of feasibility studies, to be undertaken by the Member States, in particular by those which cannot provide the data for NACE Rev. 1 sections L, M, N, and O (Article 3(2)) or the breakdown of the index estimating total labour costs, excluding bonuses (Article 4(2)).\n2. The feasibility studies shall be carried out, taking into account the benefits of collecting the data in relation to the cost of collection and the burden on business, to assess:\n(a) how the quarterly labour cost indices defined in Article 4(1) can be obtained for NACE sections L, M, N and O; and\n(b) how the index estimating total labour costs, excluding bonuses, defined in Article 4(2) can be obtained.\n3. The Member States undertaking the feasibility studies shall submit an interim report on their results to the Commission no later than 31 December 2004. The participating Member States shall submit a final report on the feasibility studies to the Commission no later than 31 December 2005.\n4. The feasibility studies concerning paragraph 2(a) shall take into account the results of the pilot studies referred to in the Annexes to Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 58/97 of 20 December 1996 concerning structural business statistics(12).\n5. Measures adopted under Article 11(h) pursuant to the results of the feasibility studies shall respect the principle of cost-effectiveness, as defined in Article 10 of Regulation (EC) No 322/97, including the minimisation of the burden on respondents.\n6. The implementation of measures adopted under Article 11(h) pursuant to the results of the feasibility studies shall make possible the transmission of data for the first quarter of 2007, provided that the results of the feasibility studies allow for the cost-effective production of data of sufficient quality.\nArticle 11\nImplementing measures\nThe measures for implementing this Regulation, including measures to take account of economic and technical changes, shall be laid down in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 12(2). Such measures shall concern in particular:\n(a) definition, in accordance with Article 4(1), of the disaggregations to be included in the fixed structure;\n(b) technical specification of the index (Article 2);\n(c) inclusion of NACE Rev.1 sections L, M, N and O (Article 3);\n(d) breakdown of indices by economic activities (Article 4);\n(e) format for transmission of results and the adjustment procedures to be applied (Article 6);\n(f) separate quality criteria for current and back data transmitted and contents of quality reports (Article 8);\n(g) transition period (Article 9);\n(h) the establishment of feasibility studies and decisions pursuant to their results (Article 10); and\n(i) the methodology to be used for chaining the index (Annex).\nArticle 12\nProcedure\n1. The Commission shall be assisted by the Statistical Programme Committee instituted by Article 1 of Decision 89/382/EEC, Euratom.\n2. Where reference is made to this paragraph, Articles 5 and 7 of Decision 1999/468/EC shall apply, having regard to the provisions of Article 8 thereof.\nThe period laid down in Article 5(6) of Decision 1999/468/EC shall be set at three months.\n3. The Committee shall adopt its rules of procedure.\nArticle 13\nReports\nThe Commission shall submit a report on the implementation of this Regulation to the European Parliament and the Council every two years. This report shall evaluate in particular the quality of the transmitted LCI series data and the quality of the transmitted back data.\nThe first report shall be submitted no later than 31 December of the year following the entry into force of this Regulation. It will refer only to the actions executed by Member States to prepare the application of this Regulation.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\nDone at Brussels, 27 February 2003.",

The Community shall make available to Albania a long-term loan facility of a maximum principal amount of up to EUR 20 million with a maximum maturity of 15 years and a grace period of 10 years, with a view to ensuring a sustainable balance of payments situation and consolidating the country's reserve position.\n2. To this end, the Commission shall be empowered to borrow, on behalf of the Community, the necessary resources that will be placed at the disposal of Albania in the form of a loan.\n3. The loan referred to in paragraph 2 will be managed by the Commission in close consultation with the Economic and Financial Committee and in a manner consistent with any agreement reached between the IMF and Albania.\nArticle 2\n1. The Commission shall be empowered to agree with the authorities of Albania, after consultation with the Economic and Financial Committee, the economic and institutional policy conditions attached to the loan. These conditions shall be consistent with any of the agreements referred to in Article 1(3).\n2. The Commission shall verify at regular intervals, in collaboration with the Economic and Financial Committee and in coordination with the IMF, that the economic and institutional policy in Albania is in accordance with the objectives of this macro-financial assistance and that its conditions are being fulfilled.\nArticle 3\n1. The macro-financial assistance shall be made available to Albania in two instalments.\n2. Subject to the provisions of Article 2, the first instalment shall be released on the basis of a successful completion of the mid-term review of the first year of the programme supported by a three-year ESAF arrangement between the IMF and Albania.\n3. Subject to the provisions of Article 2, the second instalment shall be released on the basis of a satisfactory track record in the implementation of the ESAF programme and not before one quarter after the disbursement of the first instalment.\n4. The funds shall be paid to the Central Bank of Albania.\nArticle 4\n1. The borrowing and loan operations referred to in Article 1 shall be carried out using the same value date and must not involve the Community in the transformation of maturities, in any exchange or interest rate risks, or any other commercial risk.\n2. The Commission shall take the necessary steps, should Albania so request, to ensure that an early repayment clause is included in the loan terms and conditions, and that it may be exercised.\n3. At the request of Albania, and where circumstances permit an improvement in the interest rate on the loan, the Commission may refinance all or part of its initial borrowings or restructure the corresponding financial conditions. Refinancing or restructuring operations shall be carried out in accordance with the conditions set out in paragraph 1 and shall not have the effect of extending the average maturity of the borrowing concerned or increasing the amount, expressed at the current exchange rate, of capital outstanding at the date of the refinancing or restructuring.\n4. All related costs incurred by the Community in concluding and carrying out the operation pursuant to this Decision shall be borne by Albania.\n5. The Economic and Financial Committee shall be kept informed of developments in the operations referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3 at least once a year.\nArticle 5\nAt least once a year the Commission shall address to the European Parliament and the Council a report, which will include an evaluation on the implementation of this Decision.\nDone at Luxembourg, 22 April 1999.",

This Directive is a specific Directive within the meaning of Article 3 of Directive 76/893/EEC.\n2. This Directive shall apply to plastic materials and articles, that is to say to materials and articles and parts thereof:\n(a) consisting exclusively of plastics, or\n(b) composed of two or more layers of materials, each consisting exclusively of plastics, which are bound together by means of adhesives or by any other means,\nwhich, in the finished product state, are intended to come into contact or are brought into contact with foodstuffs and are intended for that purpose.\n3. For the purposes of this Directive, 'plastics' shall mean the organic macromolecular compounds obtained by polymerization, polycondensation, polyaddition or any other similar process from molecules with a lower molecular weight or by chemical alteration of natural macromolecules. Silicones and other similar macromolecular compounds shall also be regarded as plastics. Other substances or matter may be added to such macromolecular compounds.\nHowever, the following shall not be regarded as 'plastics':\n(i) varnished or unvarnished regenerated cellulose film;\n(ii) elastomers and natural and synthetic rubber;\n(iii) paper and paperboard, whether modified or not by the addition of plastics;\n(iv) surface coatings obtained from:\n- paraffin waxes, including synthetic paraffin waxes, and/or micro-crystalline waxes,\n- mixtures of the waxes listed in the first indent with each other and/or with plastics.\n4. This Directive shall not apply to materials and articles composed or two or more layers, one or more of which does not consist exclusively of plastics, even if the one intended to come into direct contact with foodstuffs does consist exclusively of plastics.\nA decision on the application of this Directive to the materials and articles referred to in the first subparagraph and on any adaptations to the Directive that may become necessary shall be taken at a later date.\nArticle 2\n1. The migration level of the constituents of the materials and articles referred to in Article 1 into or onto foodstuffs must not exceed the limits laid down in the lists of substances whose use is authorized to the exclusion of any others.\n2. In the absence of methods of analysis determined in accordance with Article 9 of Directive 76/893/EEC which make it possible to determine the level of migration into foodstuffs, that level shall be determined in the simulants listed in Chapter I of the Annex.\n3. The Council, acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 100 of the Treaty and on a proposal from the Commission, shall draw up a list of substances or matter whose use is authorized to the exclusion of any others and a list of simulants to be used for each foodstuff or group of foodstuffs and shall determine the concentration thereof.\nArticle 3\n1. Verification of a migration in the simulants shall be carried out using conventional migration tests, the basic rules for which are laid down in the Annex to this Directive.\n2. (a) However, where a Member State, as a result of new information or of a reassessment of existing information made since this Directive was adopted, has detailed grounds for establishing that for a given plastic material or article the basic rules laid down in the Annex for migration tests are technically unsuitable or because the actual conditions of use are basically different from the test conditions specified in the table in the Annex, that Member State may,\nwithin its territory and only for the particular case, temporarily suspend application of the basic rules referred to in the Annex and permit the use of more appropriate basic rules. It shall immediately inform the other Member States and the Commission thereof and give the reasons for its decision.\n(b) The Commission shall examine, as soon as possible, the reasons given by the Member State concerned and shall consult the Member States within the Standing Committee for Foodstuffs and shall then deliver its opinion forthwith and take the appropriate measures.\n(c) If the Commission considers that amendments to this Directive are necessary in order to alleviate the difficulties mentioned in subparagraph (a), it shall initiate the procedure laid down in Article 10 of Directive 76/893/EEC; in that case, the Member State which has adopted the more appropriate basic rules may retain them until the said amendments enter into force.\nArticle 4\nAdaptations to be made to Chapter II of the Annex to this Directive in the light of progress in scientific and technical knowledge shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 10 of Directive 76/893/EEC.\nArticle 5\nThis Directive shall not affect national provisions relating to the other rules provided for in Article 3 of Directive 76/893/EEC nor the options open to Member States under Article 7 (4) and (5) of that Directive.\nArticle 6\nMember States shall comply with this Directive not later than such time as a specific directive laying down the limits referred to in Article 2 (1) is implemented.\nArticle 7\nThis Directive is addressed to the Member States.\nDone at Luxembourg, 18 October 1982.",

whereas under those quotas the customs duty is limited to 6 % ad valorem; whereas those quotas are to be opened on a multiannual basis and administered by the Commission;\nWhereas it is necessary to maintain a system of administration which ensures that only products originating in the Republic of Indonesia and the People's Republic of China can be imported under the quotas allocated to those countries; whereas, as a result, the issue of import licences should continue to be subject to the presentation of export licences issued by the authorities of those two countries, specimens of which have been sent to the Commission; whereas, as regards products originating in Vietnam, in accordance with the practice followed for several years, import licence applications are subject, in addition to other provisions, to presentation of a certificate issued on the initiative of the exporting country;\nWhereas, since imports of the products concerned into the Community have traditionally been administered on a calendar-year basis, that system should be maintained;\nWhereas imports of products covered by CN codes 0714 10 91, 0714 10 99, 0714 90 11 and 0714 90 19 are subject to presentation of an import licence for which common detailed rules of application are laid down in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3719/88 (2), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2350/96 (3); whereas Commission Regulation (EC) No 1162/95 (4), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1527/96 (5), lays down special detailed rules for the application of the system of licences for cereals and rice;\nWhereas the usual additional rules for the management of such quotas, relating in particular to the submission of applications, issue of licences, and monitoring of imports should be applied;\nWhereas, in particular, the origin of the products should be ascertained by providing that the issue of import licences be subject to the presentation of certificates of origin issued by the countries concerned; whereas, however, certificates of origin should not be required for products originating in the People's Republic of China;\nWhereas, for the sake of sound management of the import arrangements in question, applications for licences may not cover a quantity in excess of that entered on the document certifying loading and shipment to the Community; whereas a maximum quantity per application should also be laid down in certain cases, and it should be stipulated that in no case may applications cover a quantity greater than that for which the aforementioned proof is provided;\nWhereas, in cases where the quantities actually unloaded are slightly in excess of the quantities given in the import licences, measures to ensure the release for free circulation of the surplus quantities should be adopted if the country of origin of the products is able to guarantee that the formalities needed for this purpose can be executed; whereas Indonesia and China appear able to meet this condition;\nWhereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nTITLE I\nQuotas\nArticle 1\nFrom 1 January 1997 the following annual tariff quotas are hereby opened for imports of products covered by CN codes 0714 10 91, 0714 10 99, 0714 90 11 and 0714 90 19 at a customs duty rate of 6 % ad valorem:\n1. a quota of 825 000 tonnes for the products in question originating in the Republic of Indonesia;\n2. a quota of 145 590 tonnes for the products in question originating in other member countries of the World Trade Organization (WTO) other than Thailand;\n3. a quota of 350 000 tonnes for the products in question originating in the People's Republic of China;\n4. a quota of 32 000 tonnes for the products in question originating in other countries not members of the WTO other than China, of which 2 000 tonnes shall be reserved for the importation of products of a kind used for human consumption, in immediate packings of a net content not exceeding 28 kilograms, either fresh and whole or without skin and frozen, whether or not sliced.\nArticle 2\nWith a view to the release for free circulation of the products referred to in Article 1, import licence applications shall be lodged in any Member State and licences issued shall be valid throughout the Community.\nArticle 3\n1. Import licence applications shall be admissible if:\n(a) they are accompanied by the original of a certificate drawn up by the competent authorities of the country concerned certifying the origin of the goods in accordance with the specimen in Annex I; however, such a certificate shall not be necessary for imports of products originating in the People's Republic of China and referred to in Article 1 (3);\n(b) they are accompanied by proof, in the form of a copy of the bill of lading, that the goods have been loaded in the third country of origin and are transported to the Community by the vessel mentioned in the application, and, where the third country does not have direct access to the sea, an international transport document certifying transport of the goods from the country of origin to the port of shipment is also provided;\n(c) in the case of products originating in Indonesia and China, they are accompanied by the relevant export licences as referred to in Title II issued by the authorities, duly completed in accordance with the specimen in Annexes II and III. The originals of such licences shall be kept by the authority issuing them.

Notwithstanding Article 10 of Regulation (EC) No 1162/95, the security against import licences shall be ECU 20 per tonne.\nHowever, in the case of products originating in the People's Republic of China, the security shall be ECU 5 per tonne.\n2. If, pursuant to Article 8 (4), the quantity in respect of which the licence is issued is less than the quantity in respect of which it was applied for, the security corresponding to the difference shall be released.\n3. The fourth indent of Article 5 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 3719/88 shall not apply.\nArticle 8\n1. Licence applications shall be lodged with the competent authorities of the Member States between Monday and Wednesday each week, up to 13.00.\nHowever, the first day each year for lodging applications shall be the first working day in January.\n2.

In the case of products originating in Indonesia, once it has been verified that the quantities actually unloaded for a given consignment are in excess of those covered by the import licence(s) issued for that consignment, the competent authorities which issued the licence(s) concerned shall, at the request of the importer, notify the Commission by telex or fax as quickly as possible, on a case-by-case basis, of the Indonesian export licence number(s), the import licence number(s), the excess quantity and the name of the vessel.\nThe Commission shall contact the Indonesian authorities with a view to the issue of new export licences. Pending their preparation, the surplus quantities may not be released for free circulation as long as the new import licences for the quantities in question cannot be presented. The new import licences shall be issued under the terms laid down in Article 8.\n2. However, notwithstanding paragraph 1, where the quantities unloaded are not more than 2 % in excess of the quantities covered by the import licences issued corresponding to the export licences granted for the vessel concerned, the competent authorities in the Member State where release for free circulation is to take place shall, at the request of the importer, authorize the release for free circulation of the excess quantities provided that the importer pays a customs duty limited to 6 % ad valorem and lodges a security for an amount equal to the difference between the full duty and that paid.\nThe Commission, on receipt of the information referred to in the first subparagraph of paragraph 1, shall contact the Indonesian authorities with a view to the issue of new export licences.\nSecurities shall be released on presentation to the competent authorities of the Member State in which release for free circulation is to take place of a supplementary import licence for the excess quantity in question. Application for such licences shall not be subject to the lodging of a security against the licence as provided for in Article 14 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 3719/88 and Article 7 of this Regulation. Such licences shall be issued under the terms of Article 8 on presentation of one or more new export licences issued by the Indonesian authorities for the excess quantity in question.

Application of paragraphs 1 and 2 may not result in importation of quantities of goods exceeding the overall quota authorized for the year. If, when a supplementary import licence is issued, it is found that the overall quota has been exceeded, the quantity covered by the supplementary licence shall be deducted from the overall quota authorized for the following year.\nArticle 11\nThe quantities of products to which each import licence issued relates shall be deducted from the overall quota for the year of issue of those licences.\nLicences issued pursuant to this Regulation shall be valid throughout the Community for 60 days from the date of actual issue.\nHowever, licences issued for products originating in Indonesia or China shall be valid up to the last day of validity of the export licence plus 30 days.\nArticle 12\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on 1 January 1997.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\nDone at Brussels, 18 December 1996.",
