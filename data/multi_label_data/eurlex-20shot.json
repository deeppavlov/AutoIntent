The Commission shall inform the Member States of the drawings made.\nArticle 4\nEach Member State shall ensure that importers of the products in question have equal and continuous access to the quotas for as long as the balance of the relevant quota volume so permits.\nArticle 5\nThe Member States and the Commission shall cooperate closely to ensure that this Regulation is complied with.\nArticle 6\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\nDone at Luxembourg, 29 October 1990.",

Each month Member States shall produce HICPs using weightings which reflect consumers' expenditure patterns in a weighting reference period ending no more than seven years before the preceding December.\n2. Each year, Member States shall carry out a review of weightings in order to ensure that they are sufficiently reliable and relevant to meet the comparability requirement established in Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 2494/95. The review may be confined to weightings at the level of sub-indices and their major components.\n3. In the review, Member States shall check whether or not there have been any important changes since the weighting reference period in current use regarding price developments of each major component index relative to the HICP, or sustained market developments in each major component group.\n4.

The Commission must therefore take a decision on such measures in accordance with Article 9(4) of the Decision. The Commission's assessment will depend on the compliance of the measures with the general criteria and objectives laid down in Article 2 and the specific criteria established by Articles 3 and 4 of the Decision, and on their compatibility with the proper functioning of the common market. Additionally, in accordance with Article 9(6) of the Decision, the Commission when conducting its assessment must check whether the measures conform with the modernisation, rationalisation, restructuring and activity-reduction plan which the Commission approved in its Decision 98/637/ECSC(2)).\nII\n(7) By Decision 98/637/ECSC the Commission gave an opinion as to the conformity of the 1998-2002 phase of the plan notified by Spain for the modernisation, rationalisation, restructuring and activity reduction of the coal industry with the general and specific objectives of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC.\n(8) The Commission has verified that the measures taken to modernise, rationalise, restructure and reduce activity in the coal industry during 1998, and those notified for 1999, correspond to the plans which the Commission had approved.\n(9) Spain's coal production of 1625000 tonnes in 1998 is 6,7 % lower than that shown in the plans for 1998 and 6,2 % lower than that which obtained in 1997. The production figure notified by Spain for 1999 is 16300000 tonnes, lower by 6,8 % and 3,3 % than that shown in the plans for 1998 and 1999 respectively.\n(10) The number of workers in the undertakings has fallen, from 22840 at the end of 1997 to 18498 at the end of 1998. A further reduction of 1320 workers is forecast for 1999.\n(11) During 1998 the definitive closure of mines with a production capacity of 1103000 tonnes was begun, and other mines with a total capacity of 700000 tonnes have already announced their closure in 1999.\n(12) These reductions, which are larger than those initially envisaged, are due to the inclusion in the closure plans, in conformity with Article 4 of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC, of undertakings which were unable to meet the conditions which would entitle them to operating aid under Article 3 of the Decision.\n(13) By letter of 25 September 1998 Spain notified the Commission, as required by Commission Decision 98/637/ECSC, of the undertakings' production costs in 1997. The Commission's analysis of the production costs of the undertakings or production units in receipt of operating aid (Article 3 of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC) revealed a mean reduction in the cost of production, at 1992 prices, from 109,2 ECU/tce in 1994 to 81,02 ECU/tce in 1997. This mean reduction of 25,8 % between 1992 and 1997 breaks down into a reduction of more than 30 % for 30,3 % of production, between 30 % and 20 % for 42,5 % of production, between 20 % and 10 % for 16,6 % of production and between 10 % and 0 % for 8,5 % of production. The remaining 2,1 % increased their cost of production.\n(14) The following undertakings or production units: Antracitas de Guillón S.A., Antracitas de Rengos S.A., ENCASUR (underground mines component only), Inversiones Terrales S.A., Minas de Escucha S.A., Ramiro Genuario y otras S.A., Antracitas de Rodrigatos, S.A., with a total annual production of 675800 tonnes, have been included by Spain, according to its notification of 16 October 1998, in a closure plan with a deadline occurring before the date of expiry of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC. The Commission has checked that the conditions laid down in Article 3(2) of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC cannot be achieved by these undertakings, so they do indeed qualify for activity-reduction aid in accordance with Article 4 of the Decision.\n(15) If Spain finds that other undertakings are experiencing difficulties in making further progress towards economic viability it will inform the Commission and, if so, propose activity-reduction measures as provided for in Article 4 of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC.\n(16) Throughout the period from 1999 to 2002 Spain will continue to monitor production cost trends at each of the coal undertakings and, should the undertakings prove unable to achieve the trend downwards in production costs provided for in Article 3(2) of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC, will propose the necessary corrective measures to the Commission.\n(17) One of the conditions laid down by the Commission in its Decision 98/637/ECSC on the conformity of the Spanish coal industry's modernisation, rationalisation, restructuring and activity-reduction plan with the general and specific objectives of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC, is that Spain must ensure that, between 1 January 1998 and the date of closure, no aid is granted to cover the production costs of the mines formerly belonging to Minas de Lieres SA, which were put back into production by Hunosa. The Commission notes that for 1998 and 1999 the mines in question experienced or are set to experience production losses valued respectively at ESP 193300000 (EUR 1161756,40) and ESP 169000000 (EUR 1015710,46). On the basis of the information in the letter of 16 April 1999 from Spain, the Commission notes that the operating losses of the old Minas de Lieres mines were not covered by aid during 1998 and that no aid has been set aside for them for 1999. These mines must close down definitively by 31 December 1999.\n(18) The aid notified by Spain to cover operating losses in 1999 provides for a reduction in production aid compared with 1998, at current currency values, of 4 % for underground mines and 6 % for open-cast mines. The total amount of aid, i.e. aid for current production plus aid to cover exceptional restructuring costs, fell by 8 %. These reductions will help to achieve the objective of degression of aid. The aid to cover the production costs of the undertakings or production units, i.e. the aid under Articles 3 and 4 of the Decision, is intended to cover all or part of the difference between the production costs and the selling price freely agreed between the contracting parties in the light of the conditions prevailing on the world market.\n(19) The reduction in the aid notified for 1999 compared with 1998 is still more notable when the fall in the selling price of coal on the world market is taken into consideration.\n(20) In accordance with Article 2(2) of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC, all the aid which Spain plans to grant to the coal industry under the said Decision in 1999 has been entered in national, regional or local public budgets. Part of this aid to Hunosa could be channelled via SEPI (Sociedad Estatal de Participaciones Industriales).\n(21) In view of the above, the measures notified by Spain for 1999 are deemed to be in line with the modernisation, rationalisation, restructuring and activity-reduction plans approved by the Commission in its Decision 98/637/ECSC, provided all the conditions laid down in the Decision are complied with, particularly those relating to non-discrimination between producers, between purchasers or between users of coal in the Community.\nIII\n(22) The aid of ESP 121030 million (EUR 727404949,94) which Spain plans to grant the coal industry in 1999 is intended to compensate in full or in part for operating losses suffered by coal undertakings.\n(23) It is intended to cover the difference between the production costs and the selling price freely agreed between the contracting parties in the light of the conditions prevailing on the world market.\n(24) The sum notified subdivides into operating aid of ESP 54544 million (EUR 327816042,22) under Article 3 of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC, and activity-reduction aid of ESP 66486 million (EUR 399588907,72) under Article 4 thereof.\n(25) The operating aid of ESP 54544 million (EUR 327816042,22) is intended to cover the operating losses of 57 undertakings with a combined envisaged production of 13335 million tonnes in 1999.\n(26) The Commission notes, after verifying the production costs of these undertakings, at 1992 prices, that the downward trend of production costs observed in the period 1994-1997 will continue in 1999. The reduction envisaged for 1999, compared with 1997, will be 7,2 %.\n(27) In 1997 the mean production cost, at 1992 prices, of the undertakings receiving aid under Article 3 of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC is 81,02 ECU/tce, broken down as follows:\n- 10 %of production at costs between42 and57 ECU/tce;\n- 10 %of production at costs between59 and62 ECU/tce;\n- 10 %of production at costs between63 and71 ECU/tce;\n- 10 %of production at costs between72 and81 ECU/tce;\n- 10 %of production at costs between82 and85 ECU/tce;\n- 10 %of production at costs between86 and87 ECU/tce;\n- 10 %of production at costs between88 and90 ECU/tce;\n- 10 %of production at costs between91 and92 ECU/tce;\n- 10 %of production at costs between93 and95 ECU/tce;\n- 10 %of production at costs between96 and 129 ECU/tce.\n(28) Spain will notify the Commission, by no later than 30 September 1999, of the undertakings' production costs for 1998, to enable the Commission to verify the downward trend of these costs over the period 1994 to 1998.\n(29) The mean selling price to the thermal power stations of the 13335000 tonnes (8476700 tce) of production envisaged in 1999 by the undertakings in receipt of operating aid is ESP 5955/tonne (EUR 35,79/tonne). In the light of the envisaged mean cost of this production in 1999, namely ESP 10046/tonne (EUR 60,38/tonne), the Commission notes that the aid notified corresponds to the difference between the cost of production and the selling price freely agreed between the contracting parties in the light of the conditions prevailing on the world market.\n(30) Of the aid of ESP 66486 million (EUR 399588907,72) to reduce activity, ESP 58442 million (EUR 351243494,04) is intended to cover the operating losses of Hunosa; ESP 5147 million (EUR 30934093,01) the operating losses of Mina la Camocha; ESP 624 million (EUR 3750315,53) the operating losses of the underground workings of Endesa; ESP 533 million (EUR 3203394,52) the operating losses of the Encasur underground workings; ESP 1115 million (EUR 6701284,96) the operating losses of Antracitas de Guillón; ESP 271 million (EUR 1628742,80) the operating losses of Antracitas de Rengos; and ESP 354 million (EUR 2127582,85) the operating losses of Minas de Escucha, with the combined production of these undertakings totalling an envisaged 3 million tonnes in 1999.\n(31) Of the aid of ESP 58442 million (EUR 351243494,04) to Hunosa, ESP 39555 million (EUR 237730337,89) will be granted via SEPI.\n(32) The mean selling price to the thermal power stations of the 3000 million tonnes (2350000 tce) of production envisaged in 1999 by the undertakings in receipt of aid to reduce activity is ESP 5350/tonne (EUR 3215/tonne). In the light of the envisaged mean cost of this production in 1999, namely ESP 27550/tonne (EUR 165,58/tonne), the Commission notes that that the aid notified corresponds to the difference between the cost of production and the selling price freely agreed between the contracting parties in the light of the conditions prevailing on the world market.\n(33) The aid to cover the operating losses suffered by coal undertakings has been entered in the general State budgets for 1999. It is 5 % lower than the aid authorised by the Commission for 1998. Spain sent notification of the Spanish Council of Ministers' decision on the company-by-company allocation of this aid. This decision has been published in Spain's Boletin Official del Estado(3)).\n(34) The inclusion of this measure in the modernisation, rationalisation, restructuring and activity-reduction plan notified by Spain, and the reduction in the aid and quantities envisaged for 1999, are in line with the objectives of the first and second indents of Article 2(1) of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC, and in particular the objective to solve the social and regional problems created by developments in the coal industry.\n(35) In view of the above, and on the basis of the information provided by Spain, this aid is compatible with Articles 3 and 4 of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC and with the proper functioning of the common market.\nIV\n(36) The aid of ESP 44141 million (EUR 265292753) which Spain is proposing to grant is intended to cover, with the exception of the costs for the payment of social-welfare benefits borne by the State as a special contribution pursuant to Article 56 of the Treaty, compensation paid to workers in Spanish coal undertakings who have lost their jobs or have had to or will have to take early retirement under the modernisation, rationalisation, restructuring and activity-reduction plan for the Spanish coal industry.\n(37) Part of this aid, totalling ESP 34046 million (EUR 204620581,06), is to be granted to Hunosa to cover the costs for the workers who took early retirement before 1 January 1999 and the 536 workers who will retire in 1999. This part of the aid will be granted to Hunosa via SEPI.\n(38) The remaining ESP 10095 million (EUR 60672171,94) is intended to cover compensation for the approximately 1000 workers who will lose their jobs in 1999 in the other undertakings affected by modernisation, rationalisation, restructuring and activity-reduction measures.\n(39) This aid, designed to cover exceptional costs that have arisen or are due to arise from restructuring, has been entered in the general State budgets for 1999.\n(40) These financial measures relate to action made necessary by the modernisation, rationalisation and restructuring of the Spanish coal industry and cannot therefore be considered to be related to current production (inherited liabilities).\n(41) Pursuant to Article 5 of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC the aid mentioned explicitly in the Annex to the Decision, namely the cost of paying social-welfare benefits resulting from the pensioning-off of workers before they reach statutory retirement age and other exceptional expenditure on workers who lose their jobs as a result of restructuring and rationalisation, may be considered compatible with the common market provided that the amount paid does not exceed such costs.\n(42) In view of the above and on the basis of the information provided by Spain, this aid is compatible with Article 5 of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC and with the proper functioning of the common market.\nV\n(43) The aid of ESP 13079 million (EUR 78606373,13) which Spain proposes to grant is intended to cover part of the loss of value of the fixed assets of coal undertakings which have to close down totally or partially, and other exceptional costs to enable undertakings to cover the costs that have arisen or are due to arise from the progressive closures connected with the restructuring of the coal industry.\n(44) Part of this aid, totalling ESP 2754 million (EUR 16551873,35), will be granted to Hunosa via SEPI. Since Minas de Lieres S.A. received closure aid in Spain's 1991 to 1993 restructuring plan it is not therefore entitled to receive any other aid to cover the costs of closure, which must be completed by no later than 31 December 1999. The remaining sum, totalling ESP 10325 million (EUR 62054499,78), will be granted to the other undertakings that are restructuring or reducing their activity.\n(45) The aid to cover exceptional costs arising or due to arise from restructuring has been entered in the general State budgets for 1999.\n(46) These financial measures relate to action made necessary by the modernisation, rationalisation and restructuring of the Spanish coal industry and cannot therefore be considered to be related to current production (inherited liabilities).\n(47) Pursuant to Article 5 of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC, the aid mentioned explicitly in the Annex to the Decision, namely exceptional intrinsic depreciation provided that it results from the restructuring of the industry (without taking account of any revaluation which has occurred- since 1 January 1986 and which exceeds the rate of inflation) and other additional work and residual costs arising from closures of installations, can be considered compatible with the common market provided that the amount paid does not exceed such costs.\n(48) Spain must ensure that the aid granted to undertakings to cover exceptional costs is in line with the categories of costs specified in the Annex to Decision No 3632/93/ECSC.\n(49) In view of the above, and on the basis of the information provided by Spain, this aid is compatible with Article 5 of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC and with the proper functioning of the common market.\nVI\n(50) The aid granted by Spain to the coal industry is restricted to coal production destined to be used for electricity production. Spain undertakes to ensure that the coal sold to the industrial and domestic sectors is sold at prices (exempt from compensation) that cover the costs of production.\n(51) Spain must ensure that the aid granted to current production under this Decision does not give rise to any discrimination between coal producers, between purchasers or between users on the Community coal market.\n(52) Spain undertakes to ensure that, within the framework of the provisions of Article 86 of the Treaty, the aid is limited to that which is strictly necessary in the light of the social and regional considerations which characterise the decline of the Community's coal industry. The aid may not give any economic advantage, whether directly or indirectly, to productions for which no aid is authorised or to other activities distinct from coal production.\n(53) In accordance with the second indent of Article 3(1) and with Article 9(2) and (3) of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC the Commission must verify that the aid authorised for current production responds exclusively to the objectives stated in Articles 3 and 4 of the Decision. Spain must notify the Commission, by no later than 30 June 2000, of the amount of aid actually paid during 1999, and declare any corrections made to the amounts originally notified. When submitting this annual statement of aid paid, Spain must also supply the Commission with all the information necessary for verification of the criteria set out in the Articles in question.\n(54) In approving the aid, the Commission has recognised the need to soften, as far as possible, the social and regional impact of the restructuring of the coal industry, given the economic and social situation surrounding the mines affected.\n(55) In view of the above, and on the basis of the information provided by Spain, the measures and the aid proposed for the coal industry are deemed to be compatible with the objectives of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC and with the proper functioning of the common market.\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\nArticle 1\nSpain is hereby authorised to pay the following aid in respect of 1999:\n(a) operating aid of ESP 54544 million (EUR 327816042,22) under Article 3 of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC;\n(b) aid for the reduction of activity of ESP 66486 million (EUR 399588971,72) under Article 4 of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC;\n(c) aid of ESP 44141 million (EUR 265292753), under Article 5 of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC, to cover exceptional welfare aid for workers who lose their jobs as a result of the measures to modernise, rationalise, restructure and reduce the activity of the Spanish coal industry;\n(d) aid of ESP 13079 million (EUR 78606373,13), under Article 5 of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC, to cover the exceptional technical costs of closing down mining installations as a result of the measures to modernise, rationalise, restructure and reduce the activity of the Spanish coal industry.\nArticle 2\nIn accordance with Article 86 of the ECSC Treaty, Spain shall adopt all appropriate measures, whether general or particular, to ensure fulfilment of the obligations resulting from this Decision. It shall ensure that the aid authorised is used for the purposes intended and that any unspent, overestimated or incorrectly used aid for any item covered by this Decision is repaid to it.\nArticle 3\nSpain shall notify the Commission, by 30 June 2000 at the latest, of the amount of aid actually paid in respect of 1999.\nArticle 4\nThis Decision is addressed to the Kingdom of Spain.\nDone at Brussels, 4 May 1999.",

There is a risk that the disease agent might be spread from wild birds to domestic birds, notably poultry, and from one Member State to other Member States and third countries through the international trade in live birds or their products.\n(2)\nCases of highly pathogenic avian influenza of the subtype virus H5NI are suspected or confirmed in several Member States. Taking into account the epidemiological situation, the Commission adopted Decision 2006/115/EC of 17 February 2006 concerning certain protection measures in relation to highly pathogenic avian influenza in wild birds in the Community and repealing Decisions 2006/86/EC, 2006/90/EC, 2006/91/EC, 2006/94/EC, 2006/104/EC and 2006/105/EC (4).\n(3)\nThe specific measures provided for in this Decision should apply without prejudice to the measures to be taken by Member States in the framework of Council Directive 92/40/EEC of 19 May 1992 introducing Community measures for the control of avian influenza (5).\n(4)\nHowever, the measures provided for in Directive 92/40/EEC are minimum control measures and require supplementary provisions notably on the movement of certain birds and of products from poultry and other birds originating in the zone affected by the disease in wild birds.\n(5)\nIt is necessary to clarify the interaction between Community measures taken in relation to highly pathogenic avian influenza caused by an influenza A virus of the serotype H5N1 in wild birds and those to be applied in case of the disease in poultry.\n(6)\nIt appeared also necessary to further specify the starting point for the minimum duration of the measures provided for in this Decision.\n(7)\nIt is appropriate to control and restrict the movement of, in particular, live birds and hatching eggs while allowing the controlled dispatch from the zones of such birds and products of avian origin subject to certain conditions. However certain adjustments are admissible as long as they are in accordance with the relevant provisions of the above Directive.\n(8)\nTransport of hatching eggs from the protection zones should be permitted under certain conditions. Specific derogations should be provided for hatching eggs or SPF-eggs used in specialised laboratories or institutes for scientific, diagnostic or pharmaceutical purposes.\n(9)\nCouncil Directive 2002/99/EC of 16 December 2002 laying down the animal health rules governing the production, processing, distribution and introduction of products of animal origin for human consumption (6), establishes a list of treatments rendering meat from restricted areas safe, and provides for the possibility to establish a specific health mark and the health mark required for meat not authorised for placing on the market for animal health reasons. It is appropriate to permit the dispatch from the protection zones of meat bearing the health mark provided for in that Directive and meat products subjected to treatment referred to therein.\n(10)\nCommission Regulation (EC) No 2076/2005 of 5 December 2005 laying down transitional arrangements for the implementation of Regulations (EC) No 853/2004, (EC) No 854/2004 and (EC) No 882/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council and amending Regulations (EC) No 853/2004 and (EC) No 854/2004 (7), provides for transitional measures allowing the use of a national identification mark for products of animal origin intended for human consumption which may only be marketed in the national territory of the Member State where they are produced.\n(11)\nRegulation (EC) No 1774/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 3 October 2002 laying down health rules concerning animal by-products not intended for human consumption (8), authorises the placing on the market of a range of animal by-products, such as gelatine for technical use, materials for pharmaceutical use and others, originating in areas of the Community under animal health restrictions, because those products are considered safe due to the specific conditions of production, processing and utilisation that effectively inactivate possible pathogens or prevent contact with susceptible animals. However it should also be possible to authorise the transport of such by-products to designated processing plants in order to be treated to the standards mentioned above, or to avail of the derogations provided for in Article 23 of that Regulation.\n(12)\nCommission Decision 2006/115/EC should be amended accordingly.\n(13)\nThe measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\nArticle 1\nDecision 2006/115/EC is amended as follows:\n1.\nthe following paragraph is added to Article 2:\n‘5. The measures laid down in this Decision shall be applied without prejudice to the measures to be applied in the event of an outbreak of avian influenza in poultry taken in accordance with Directive 92/40/EEC or, where applicable, to more stringent Community protective measures in relation to highly pathogenic avian influenza in poultry caused by an influenza virus of the type H5N1.’;\n2.\nthe second paragraph of Article 5 is replaced by the following:\n‘If the presence of a highly pathogenic influenza A virus, in particular of the subtype H5N1, is confirmed in wild birds, the measures provided for in Articles 3 and 4 shall apply for as long as is necessary having regard to the geographical, administrative, ecological and epizootiological factors relating to avian influenza and for at least 21 in the case of the protection zone and 30 days in the case of the surveillance zone after the date of collection from wild birds of the samples on which a highly pathogenic H5 avian influenza virus was confirmed.’;\n3.\nArticle 6(1) is replaced by the following:\n‘1. By way of derogation from Article 3(2)(a), the affected Member State may authorise the transport of\n(a)\npoultry and farmed feathered game to holdings under official control situated either in the protection or in the surveillance zone;\n(b)\nready-to-lay pullets to holdings under official control in the same Member State and the poultry shall remain on the holding of destination for 21 days following the arrival of those pullets.’;\n4.\nArticle 6(2)(b) is replaced by the following:\n‘(b)\nday-old chicks from the protection zone to holdings under official control on its territory provided, that either on the holding of destination there are no other poultry or captive birds, except pet birds referred to in Article 1(2)(c)(i), which are kept separated from poultry, or the transport is carried out under the conditions described in Article 24(1)(a) and (b) of Directive 2005/94/EC and the poultry shall remain on the holding of destination for 21 days following the arrival of those chicks;’\n5.\nthe following is added to Article 7(1):\n‘(c)\nthe dispatch of hatching eggs or SPF-eggs from the protection zone to designated laboratories or institutes for scientific, diagnostic or pharmaceutical uses.’;\n6.\nthe following is added to Article 8(1):\n‘(g)\nfresh meat from poultry or farmed feathered game, minced meat and meat preparations and mechanically separated meat containing such meat, obtained from slaughter poultry or farmed feathered game originating in or outside that zone to the remaining part of its national territory, if such meat:\n(i)\nwas, in accordance with Article 4 of Directive 2002/99/EC, identified either with the mark provided for in Annex II to Directive 2002/99/EC or the national mark established in accordance with Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 2076/2005;\n(ii)\nwas obtained, cut, stored and transported separately from other fresh meat from poultry or farmed feathered game destined for dispatch to other Member States or for exports to third countries; and\n(iii)\nis used in such a way as to avoid it being introduced into meat products or meat preparations intended for placing on the market in other Member States or for export to third countries, unless it has undergone the treatment as required for avian influenza specified in table 1(a), (b) or (c) of Annex III to Directive 2002/99/EC.’\n7.\nArticle 8(2) is deleted.\n8.\nArticle 9(1)(a) is replaced by the following:\n‘(a)\nanimal by-products which\n(i)\ncomply with the conditions set out in Chapters II(A), III(B), IV(A), VI(A and B), VII(A), VIII(A), IX(A) and X(A) of Annex VII, and Chapter II(B) and Chapter III Title (II)(A) of Annex VIII to Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002; or\n(ii)\nare transported under bio-secure conditions to designated processing plants approved in accordance with Chapter III or Chapter IV of Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 for treatment to ensure at least the inactivation of the avian influenza virus; or\n(iii)\nare transported under bio-secure conditions for processing into feed for animals in accordance with the derogation provided for in Article 23(2)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002.’\nArticle 2\nMember States shall immediately adopt and publish the measures necessary to comply with this Decision.

THE FACTS\nA. Subject matter of the proceeding 1. On 13 December 1978, an agreement was concluded in Brussels, Belgium, called the \"Agreement concerning the use of the NAVEWA-ANSEAU conformity label for washing-machines and dishwashers\", hereinafter referred to as \"the Agreement\". The Agreement seeks to make compulsory, with effect from 1 January 1979, the attachment to washing machines and dishwashers intended for the Belgian market of a conformity label certifying that they conform to the general safety requirements laid down by water companies for the avoidance of contamination of publicly-supplied drinking water.\nB. The relevant market\n2. In 1980, total imports of washing machines into Belgium and Luxembourg were valued at 54 million ECU, including imports worth 51 77 million ECU from EEC Member States ; total imports of dishwashers into Belgium and Luxembourg were valued at 18 78 million ECU, including imports worth 18 73 million ECU from EEC Member States. In 1977, Belgian manufacture of \"white goods\" (washing machines, dishwashers, refrigerators and freezers) accounted for less than 10 % of apparent Belgian consumption of those products.\nC. Parties to the Agreement\n(1) First party:\n3. Manufacturers and sole importers affiliated to one or more of the following organizations: - the Communauté de l'Électricité (CEG) in Brussels, Belgium. This non-profit-making body, founded in 1956, comprises companies which generate and supply electricity, manufacturers and importers of electrical (1) OJ No 13, 21.2.1962, p. 204/62. (2) OJ No 127, 20.8.1963, p. 2268/63. appliances, professional associations and technical bodies concerned with the applications of electricity. Its object is to promote directly and indirectly the development of electricity in all its forms. The CEG consists of groups of members (13 at present), including the two groups, Laundry Care and Dishwashers, whose representatives took part in the discussions with ANSEAU to draw up the Agreement; - the Fédération du Commerce de l'Appareillage Électrique (FCAE-FHEA) in Brussels, Belgium. This non-profit-making body, founded in 1946, comprises manufacturers, importers and distributors of domestic electrical appliances. Its objective is to promote ethical and material improvements in the electrical appliances wholesale, import and export sectors.\n- the Union des Fournisseurs des Artisans de l'alimentation - Division Grandes Cuisines (UFARAL-ULEVO) in Brussels, Belgium. This association comprises manufacturers and importers of cookers and other equipment for use in canteens and restaurants, etc.\n4. The list of firms making up the first party at the time of signature of the Agreement is given in Annex I to this Decision. Moreover, on the basis of Article 4.1 of the Agreement, other manufacturers or sole importers acceded to the Agreement following its signature. The list of these firms is given in Annex II to this Decision. The UFARAL, although not an undertaking, is itself a party to the Agreement and not only through its members.\n(2) Second party:\n5. The Association Nationale des Services d'Eau (ANSEAU-NAVEWA) in Brussels, Belgium.\nThe objective of this non-profit-making body, founded in 1948, is to safeguard the common interests of water-supply companies in Belgium. The 31 water-supply companies which are members of ANSEAU are incorporated in various legal forms (joint local authority undertakings, utilities, associations of public authorities or companies that are partly privately owned companies). They were set up by the public authorities with the aim of providing regular supply and distribution of water under conditions which fully guarantee the protection of public health. In 1965, ANSEAU drew up its general rules on users' equipment for Belgian territory, following the entry into force of a Royal Decree making suppliers liable under criminal law for the quality of water.\nD. The main provisions of the Agreement\n6. The purpose of the Agreement is \"to prevent, in the interests of public health, any deterioration in the quality of the water supplied due to contamination or pollution, particularly when washing machines or dishwashers are connected to the drinking-water supply\" (Article 1 of the Agreement).\n7. \"The Agreement shall govern the use of the NAVEWA-ANSEAU conformity label for washing machines and dishwashers\" (Article 2). A set of special rules is annexed to the Agreement, laying down the technical requirements regarding conformity which such machines must meet. The main provisions of the Agreement are as follows:\n8. - The Agreement, which came into force on 1 January 1979, is to apply for a period of three years. It is automatically extended for a further period of three years at the end of each such period (Article 3).\n9. - For the purposes of implementation of the Agreement, the CEG acts as the representative of the firms comprising the first party (Article 4.1).\n10. - Conformity labels shall be distributed solely by the CEG (Article 5). The CEG obtains the labels from ANSEAU at a charge of Bfrs 3 750 for each label issued (Annex II to the Agreement).\nThe CEG issues the labels to the contracting parties at the following prices: - Bfrs 4 for CEG members in the two groups, Laundry Care and Dishwashers,\n- Bfrs 5 for CEG members who are not in the abovementioned groups,\n- Bfrs 6 for users who are not members of the CEG.\n11. - \"The contracting parties undertake to submit to ANSEAU via the CEG, prior to the placing on the Belgian market of new or modified machines, a complete technical file incorporating the following information: - All the data necessary for identification (...),\n- a detailed technical plan of the complete hydraulic circuit of the machines\" (Article 6).\n12. - \"ANSEAU shall carry out random sampling checks of the market at regular intervals in order to determine whether the machines placed in commercial distribution bear the conformity label and, if so, whether they in fact meet the technical requirements regarding conformity laid down in the special rules. Where there are justifiable grounds for so doing, the CEG may also request that ANSEAU carry out specific checks at a particular location\" (Article 8.1).\n13. - \"Where ANSEAU establishes, in the course of such checks, that a machine does not bear the conformity label, it shall inform the dealer concerned, by registered letter, that the machine in question does not meet the requirements for the connection of washing machines and dishwashers to the supply system\" (Article 8.2).\n14. The main provisions of the special rules annexed to the Agreement, which, as stated in Article 11 of the Agreement, are an integral part of it, are as follows:\n15. - Washing machines and dishwashers shall be regarded as meeting the technical requirements regarding conformity where they completely fulfil the requirements of the general rules on users' equipment, as supplemented by the Rules concerning the construction and inspection of washing machines and dishwashers (Article 1).\n16. - Article 38 of the general rules includes the following provision which laid down the requirements governing conformity inspection prior to the implementation of the new Agreement : \"Washing machines and dishwashers which are not on the list of appliances recognized by ANSEAU as conforming to the requirements may not be connected to the water-supply system. This list may be consulted at the offices of the water services.\"\n17. - The contracting parties themselves shall be responsible for determining whether machines to be placed on the Belgian market meet the abovementioned technical requirements regarding conformity. They may obtain the technical assistance of ANSEAU for this purpose. The first party shall be entitled to obtain ANSEAU's technical assistance 100 times each year, with exemption from payment (Article 2.1). Any further assistance rendered shall be paid for at the rate laid down in Article 1 of Annex II to the Agreement. The cost shall be approximately Bfrs 4 000 for one morning, in the course of which 10 machines may be inspected.\n18. - Where it is found that the conformity label has been affixed to machines which do not meet the abovementionned technical requirements, the labels concerned must be removed within 10 days, unless the machines are made to conform to the requirements within the same period. The contracting party responsible shall, in addition, make a flat-rate payment to ANSEAU of Bfrs 50 000. If the contracting party does not comply with the penalties imposed within the prescribed period, or if he repeats the offence within three years, he shall lose the right to use the conformity label definitively (Article 3).\n19. - Provision is made for the following transitional measures to be applied until 31 December 1979 at the latest: - \"The first party shall add to the ANSEAU list of approved machines, which shall be applicable until 31 December 1978, the most recent manufacturer's serial number issued prior to that date,\n- all machines bearing a subsequent manufacturer's serial number shall fall within the scope of this Agreement,\n- all machines bearing an earlier manufacturer's serial number shall fall within the scope of the former rules. As from 1 April 1979, such machines shall, however, be accompanied by a certificate of conformity, including a detachable label to be affixed to the machine before it is put into service\" (Article 6).\nE. Origins of the Agreement\n20. On 25 July 1978, a meeting was held at ANSEAU's registered office between the representatives of the two CEG groups, Laundry Care and Dishwashers, and the FCAE and the representatives of ANSEAU. The latter stated that the existing arrangements had the following disadvantages:\n\" - both buyers and the water-supply company must consult the list in order to check whether the machine is listed,\n- machines with the same hydraulic system but different numbering must be checked individually, which in some cases adds considerably to the cost of checking.\n\"\nThe FCAE stated that:\n\"certain unofficial importers (known as parallel importers) also benefit from the verification obtained by the official importer without having to share in the costs.\"\n21. At a meeting on 21 September 1978, ANSEAU's working group of legal experts made the following observations on a preliminary draft Agreement submitted on 8 September 1978: - \"The proposed Agreement between ANSEAU and the washing machine and dishwasher distributors concerned would enable 90 % of production to be checked. In order to check the remaining 10 %, \"the possibility might be considered of authorizing the distributors to establish the necessary contacts with those not party to the Agreement, with a view to making the conformity labels available to them also, on condition that they provide the distributors who are parties to the Agreement with the necessary guarantees and undertakings.\"\n- \"The Agreement in question would be provisional only, pending the issue by the EEC of Directives on the subject, which are currently being drafted.\"\n- \"It is advisable to draft the introduction in such a way as to emphasize the objectives of the parties concerned. As far as ANSEAU is concerned, the objective is most definitely to safeguard the quality of the water supplied and protect the health and safety of the consumer.\"\n- \"If the water companies find that a user has a machine which does not bear a conformity label, it will be their responsibility to check whether the machine meets the requirements regarding conformity ; it will not, therefore, be able to claim payment for this service from the user.\"\n22. On 19 September 1978, at a joint meeting of the two CEG groups, Laundry Care and Dishwashers, the chairmen of the two groups reviewed the current negotiations with ANSEAU. They stated that the CEG's objectives were as follows:\n\" - to reduce the costs of granting authorization and link them to CEG members' actual volume of sales,\n- to combat fraudulent practices of which the user is the victim,\n- to obtain for CEG members preferential treatment over non-members (appliances sold by non-members may not bear the authorization label, but they may, of course, have their appliances authorized by ANSEAU).\n\"\nThe following conclusion was drawn : \"The consequence would be that if a water company found a machine without a label connected to its supply system, it could go so far as to cut off the water supply to the user concerned.\"\n23. The text of the Agreement was finalized at meetings on 10 and 13 October 1978 between the representatives of the CEG, the FCAE, UFARAL and ANSEAU. The amendment to Article 4.1 of the Agreement must be emphasized. The text proposed by ANSEAU was as follows : \"It is provided, moreover, that other parties may accede to this Agreement, provided that the CEG shall have sole power of decision in the matter, and subject to the express condition that such other parties shall also be bound by all the terms of this Agreement and shall recognize the CEG as their representative.\"\nAfter \"accede to this Agreement\", the following phrase was added : \"provided that they are also manufacturers or sole importers\".\n24. On 23 October 1978, a joint meeting of the two CEG groups, Laundry Care and Dishwashers, was held, at which the FCAE and UFARAL were represented. The following statements were made by the CEG during this meeting: - \"ANSEAU has now decided to recognize only its own label (conformity label) as proof that a washing machine or dishwasher conforms to its rules, its main objective being to avoid pollution of the water supply.\"\n- \"ANSEAU will inform the general public of this label through inter alia a press conference, leaflets inserted with statements of account and any other appropriate means of promotion.\"\n- \"ANSEAU will cease to publish the lists of authorized appliances which it has published hitherto and the label alone will certify that the appliance conforms to its rules.\"\n- \"There is no question of replacing the system that has been devised with any prohibitions on imports of equipment which does not conform to the ANSEAU rules, which is not within its power or ours ; moreover, the Treaty of Rome, in fact, prohibits technical barriers to trade.\"\n- \"There is no other alternative for resolving the problem of authorization : there is either the old system which is expensive and unproductive ... or the proposed Agreement. The Agreement has the advantage of providing a weapon - albeit imperfect, but by no means negligible - against parallel imports : the CEG, which alone is authorized to issue conformity labels, will do so only to official sole importers.\"\n25. The draft Agreement received overwhelming approval at the end of that meeting, with the exception of two participants ; Indesit and Philips, who had reservations with regard to the technical problems posed by the affixing of labels at the time of manufacture and the higher cost of using the labels for firms which sold a large number of machines from a restricted range of types. The final text of the Agreement was adopted at a meeting on 26 October 1978 between the representatives of the CEG, the FCAE, UFARAL and ANSEAU. It was stressed at the meeting that the new system would have the following advantage:\n\"We are convinced that, thanks to the publicity campaign which both parties will undertake to recommend that customers, in their own interest, should buy henceforth only machines that conform to the rules (i.e. those bearing the conformity label), the sales of other machines will drop, even if they fulfil the requirements of the ANSEAU rules.\"\n26. 26. The final text of the Agreement was communicated prior to its being signed to all the firms referred to in Annex I to this Decision ; on the date of signature of the Agreement, 13 December 1978, all those firms, with the exception of the Despagne company, took part in a meeting to clarify certain points and the practical implementation of the Agreement.\nF. Implementation of the Agreement 27. The implementation of the Agreement was accompanied by a major publicity campaign undertaken by the firms comprising the first party to the Agreement and by ANSEAU. Advertisements warned consumers against purchasing machines which did not bear the conformity label ; some advertisements stated that machines without the ANSEAU label might entail heavy inspection costs and even temporary disconnection from the water supply.\n28. The CEG, which alone is authorized to issue the conformity labels, strictly applied the provisions of the Agreement stating that only manufacturers or sole importers may accede to the Agreement (Article 4.1). The standard letter sent by the CEG to dealers who ask what procedure must be followed in order to obtain the NAVEWA-ANSEAU conformity labels includes the following provisions: - \"You are requested ...\n- (c) to confirm your status as sole importer for the Belgian market, specifying the brand(s) and type(s) of washing machines and/or dishwashers concerned;\n- (d) to forward the certificate from your supplier(s) officially recognizing you as the sole importer, as referred to in (c) above\".\n29. The standard letter was sent on 30 April 1979 in answer to request from S.A. Frabelmar in Ransart (a \"CORA\" store), who stated that the company imported Indesit washing machines direct from Italy. The CEG sent copies of Frabelmar's request and its reply to the head office of Indesit-Belgique to enable it, in the words of the covering letter, to \"defend itself, armed with proof, against at least one of its parallel importers\".\n30. The same letter was sent on 8 August 1979 to Snack en Grootkeukenmateriaal, Koffiebranderij, CRES in Ghent. In its reply of 18 September 1979, the company stated that, in order to obtain information on the procedure to be followed, it had had to apply first to its local water-supply company, then to ANSEAU which had referred it to the CEG, which in turn informed the company that it must first contact UFARAL, since the equipment in question was for industrial catering. The CEG subsequently stated in its letter of 20 September 1979 that the stock of labels had in any event been used up by the firms which had been using them regularly since December 1978 and that it was waiting for further applications before reprinting them to meet requirements up to the end of 1980.\n31. ANSEAU also played an active part in monitoring the implementation of the new system. It was stated at a meeting on 30 October 1979 between the manufacturers and distributors of washing machines and dishwashers and ANSEAU : \"The market is being intensively monitored by ANSEAU in both shops and exhibitions and trade fairs\". Where one or more of the machines displayed does not bear the conformity label, ANSEAU sends the dealer concerned a registered letter listing the machines which do not bear conformity labels and stating : \"We should like to draw your attention in particular to the fact that these machines therefore do not meet the requirements for connection to the water-supply system, which are designed to prevent any contamination or pollution of drinking water. Machines which bear the conformity label are certified as conforming to those requirements. In order to avoid any inconvenience to your customers, we would therefore advise you to request your supplier to remedy this situation without delay\".\n32. A letter on these lines was sent on 25 July 1979 to the CAMPO company in Antwerp. It should be noted that approximately half of the machines which are referred to as not conforming to the requirements (that is, which do not bear the conformity label) appear in the list of machines that conform to the requirements, published by ANSEAU on 15 January 1979.\n33. ANSEAU also answers applications from foreign manufacturers or dealers who wish to export products to Belgium. In its letter of 5 November 1979 to Mr Mario Allieri, an Italian dealer who wanted to know what technical requirements had to be met before washing machines and dishwashers could be exported to Belgium, ANSEAU made the following statements:\n\"It should be noted that you are an exporter and not an importer ; it is essential, therefore, that one of the people with whom you propose to conclude an agreement be appointed by you as the sole importer for Belgium of your make of machines. That person will then fulfil the necessary requirements for membership of the Communauté de l'Electricité (CEG) ..., which acts on behalf of all the manufacturers and importers concerned.\"\n34. Finally, the local water services also carry out checks on users' premises to verify whether the machines installed are on the list of machines that conform to the rules or bear the conformity label. If neither of these requirements is met, the user is advised by letter that, within a period of three months, he must submit a detailed technical plan of the machine's complete hydraulic circuit and permit the water service to make the necessary checks on the machine, for which purpose partial dismantling of the machine must be carried out by the user himself. The user is advised that he may call upon the dealer, manufacturer or importer of the machine for that purpose.\n35. Some manufacturers of washing machines and dishwashers established outside Belgium to whom such a letter had been transmitted told the Commission that they had been induced thereby to appoint a sole importer in Belgium.\n36. Where the conformity check cannot be carried out within the prescribed period, the water service sends a registered letter instructing the user to disconnect the machine in question until it has been possible for the check to be made.\nII. LEGAL ASSESSMENT\nA. Article 85 (1) of the EEC Treaty\n37. The manufacturers and sole importers affiliated to the CEG, the FCAE and the UFARAL, who constitute the first party to the Agreement, are undertakings within the meaning of Article 85 (1). The water supply companies and services affiliated to ANSEAU which constitute the second party to the Agreement are undertakings within the meaning of that Article. The Agreement thus constitutes an agreement between undertakings and an association of undertakings.\n38. Although Article 85 (1) refers only to agreements between undertakings, it also concerns agreements between associations of undertakings. The Court of Justice held in Case 67/63, SOREMA v. High Authority, [1964] ECR 151, that Article 65 of the ECSC Treaty, the terms of which are the same, as regards this point, as those of Article 85 of the EEC Treaty, applied to an agreement concluded by an association of undertakings. The Court reaffirmed this interpretation with regard to Article 85 of the EEC Treaty in Case 71/74, FRUBO v. Commission [1975] ECR 583, in which it held that Article 85 (1) applies to associations in so far as their own activity or that of their members tends to produce the effects which the Article covers.\n39. The Agreement is an agreement which, through ANSEAU, also binds its members. Although ANSEAU does not have the formal power to impose rules on its members, but only to recommend that they implement the rules, the Agreement is in fact binding on the members of ANSEAU. Since the Agreement abolished, in respect of machines manufactured after 31 January 1979, the old system for checking conformity based on a list of authorized appliances, water-supply companies are obliged to recognize the NAVEWA-ANSEAU label as proof of conformity, in order to comply with their statutory obligations as regards water quality control. They would otherwise have to carry out conformity checks on an individual basis, on all washing machines and dishwashers sold in Belgium, which is impossible in practice.\n40. According to its provisions, the purpose of the Agreement is \"to prevent, in the interests of public health, any deterioration in the quality of the water supplied due to contamination or pollution, particularly when washing machines or dishwashers are connected to the drinking-water supply.\"\n41. Both the text of the Agreement and the way in which it is implemented make it clear for the following reasons that, in addition to its formal purpose, it is also the object of the Agreement to prevent competition within the common market within the meaning of Article 85 (1).\n(a) The NAVEWA-ANSEAU conformity label replaced the earlier system for checking conformity, based on the lists of authorized appliances\n42. ANSEAU does not dispute that, while lists of appliances that conform to the rules still exist, they concern only appliances which were manufactured prior to 31 January 1979, as is, moreover, provided in Article 6 of the special rules annexed to the Agreement, which state that the Agreement applies to all machines bearing a manufacturer's serial number issued subsequently.\n43. The only means of checking the conformity of equipment manufactured after 31 January 1979, apart from the affixing of the conformity label, is the examination by ANSEAU or its members of each machine connected to the water supply. The machines must be approved on an individual basis, and approval cannot be given on the basis of the type of machine, since there is no provision for informing all the water-supply companies that a type of equipment has been recognized as conforming to the rules. The cost of this type of examination is disproportionate by comparison with the cost of the checks carried out pursuant to the Agreement (approximately Bfrs 10 000 for each examination).\n44. The terms of the Agreement indicate, moreover, that even this possibility does not exist. It is clear from Article 8.2 of the Agreement that the purpose of the Agreement is to eliminate any possibility of providing proof of conformity other than by the affixing of the label. The general nature of the terms used invalidates unequivocally the argument put forward by the parties to the Agreement that the affixing of the label is only a specific means of carrying out the inspection of washing machines and dishwashers and concerns only machines marketed by manufacturers or sole importers. The abovementioned provision covers checks carried out on premises of all dealers, regardless of the origin of the machines.\n45. In practice, ANSEAU sends a letter indicating that certain machines which do not bear the conformity label therefore do not meet the conformity requirements even in the case of machines that are on the list of machines which conform to the requirements (cf. the letter sent to CAMPO, points 31 and 32 above). ANSEAU also delegates to its members the task of carrying out checks on dealers' premises.\n46. As regards machines already installed on consumers' premises, the local water companies are responsible for checking machines which do not bear the conformity label. For the purpose of such checks, consumers are required to provide a technical plan of the hydraulic circuit and to undertake the partial dismantling of the machine.\n47. The dissuasive effect of these measures was reinforced by the publicity campaign by ANSEAU and the other parties to the Agreement to encourage consumers to buy only machines bearing the conformity label and stressing the disadvantages which might result from purchasing machines which do not bear the label (cf. point 27). Such measures make it difficult if not impossible to sell machines which do not bear the label in Belgium, even where they meet the technical requirements regarding conformity laid down by ANSEAU.\n(b) Only manufacturers or sole importers may obtain the conformity labels\n48. Article 2 of the Agreement states that it governs the use of the NAVEWA-ANSEAU conformity label for washing machines and dishwashers. This general provision precludes anyone other than the signatories of the Agreement from obtaining the said labels. Under Article 1 only manufacturers and sole importers may be signatories. Article 4.1 of the Agreement provides that other parties may accede to the Agreement \"provided that they are also manufacturers or sole importers and that the CEG shall have the sole power of decision in the matter ...\".\n49. The CEG strictly controls the implementation of that provision by requiring firms wishing to obtain conformity labels to confirm their status as sole importers and to forward a certificate from their supplier officially recognizing them as sole importer (cf. point 28).\n50. ANSEAU indicates to firms which request information from it that the labels may be issued only to sole importers and even that the latter must be members of the CEG (cf. the letter to Mr Allieri, point 33 above). Apart from the direct measures taken by ANSEAU, the discriminatory nature of the checks made on machines which can not qualify under the provisions of the Agreement has induced some foreign manufacturers to appoint sole importers in Belgium (cf. point 35 above).\n51. The argument advanced by certain parties to the Agreement that some of them were not manufacturers or sole importers merely indicates that the Agreement has not been properly implemented and does not eliminate the Agreement's object of restricting competition. Moreover, it invalidates the argument that the Agreement can be extended only to other manufacturers or sole importers since they alone provide adequate guarantees.\n52. The fact was not disputed that, except for the specific instance of industrial catering equipment, dealers who were not manufacturers or sole importers could obtain the conformity label only through the manufacturer or sole importer.\n(c) The conformity labels are distributed solely by the CEG, which is authorized for that purpose by all the contracting parties\n53. This condition, laid down in Article 5, and the more general requirement that new parties to the Agreement must recognize the CEG as their representative (last sentence of Article 4.1) reinforce the restrictive object of the Agreement, since it is possible to obtain the conformity labels only on the basis of the provisions of the Agreement. Even if the clause excluding importers other than sole importers were deleted, they would still be able to obtain the conformity labels only through the CEG. This requirement enables an organization comprising only manufacturers and sole importers to check on the sales of importers who are not sole importers.\n54. As regards industrial catering equipment, even though UFARAL states that it is authorized by the CEG to distribute the relevant labels, the fact remains that no distinction is made in the Agreement, and the CEG's exclusive right to distribute the labels applies equally to that type of equipment. In any event, the CEG is still able, in delegating this power, to check on who has the labels and determine whether the applicants are in fact manufacturers or sole importers, by virtue of Article 4.1 of the Agreement. The fact that UFARAL may also distribute labels does not eliminate the restriction, since importers who are not members of UFARAL will normally apply to the CEG.\n55. The fact that the technical data on new or modified machines must be forwarded to ANSEAU \"via the CEG\" (Article 6 of the Agreement) also reinforces the restrictive object of the Agreement.\n56. The combined effect of the provisions of the Agreement mentioned at points 42 to 55 above is that for washing machines and dishwashers imported into Belgium by importers other than sole importers the checking of conformity to ANSEAU requirements is carried out under conditions which discriminate against them by comparison with those which apply to sole importers and manufacturers established in Belgium. The only possibility for importers other than sole importers to obtain the conformity labels is to apply to the sole importer concerned. In the event of a refusal, they or the dealer must then have each machine individually examined, which is prohibitively expensive by comparison with the selling price of the machines. These provisions thus enable sole importers to check parallel imports and to take any other restrictive measures to prevent them (cf. point 29 above).\n57. As regards industrial equipment, the restriction is not eliminated by virtue of the fact that the pattern of demand makes parallel imports difficult. The establishment of discriminatory conditions for authorization in respect of machines imported by importers other than sole importers is directed at all equipment imported by dealers who are able to provide customers with high-quality service but to whom the manufacturer does not wish to grant an exclusive dealing agreement, perhaps because of his selling policy. By tending to make the appointment of sole importers obligatory, while, according to UFARAL, the manufacturers do not pursue an exclusive distribution policy in this sector, the Agreement also restricts competition in this sector by its effect on the pattern of supply.\n58. Therefore, the provisions of the Agreement excluding the possibility for importers other than sole importers to obtain a conformity check for the machines which they import into Belgium under conditions which are not discriminatory in comparison with those applying to sole importers and manufacturers constitute restrictions of competition within the meaning of Article 85 (1) of the Treaty.\n59. These restrictions may affect trade between Member States, since the establishment of discriminatory conditions for the authorization of machines imported by importers other than sole importers may affect trade between the Member States in a manner prejudicial to the attainment of the objectives of a single market. They strengthen the exclusivity granted to sole importers in that they tend to exclude the possibility of other patterns of trade in the relevant products by way of parallel imports.\n60. The Agreement restricts competition and may affect trade between Member States appreciably, not only because of the nature of the restrictions which it contains but also because it concerns all washing machines and dishwashers sold in Belgium and most of these machines are imported from other common market countries.\nB. Article 85 (3) of the EEC Treaty\n61. Before a decision can be taken granting exemption under Article 85 (3), the Agreement must have been notified to the Commission in accordance with Articles 4 (1) or 5 (1) of Regulation No 17, except where this requirement does not apply, pursuant to Articles 4 (2) or 5 (2) of that Regulation.\n62. The Agreement was not notified to the Commission and it is not covered by the exceptions provided for in Article 4 (2) of Regulation No 17. The argument advanced by certain parties to the Agreement that the Agreement is exempt from the requirement of notification on the basis of point (1) of Article 4 (2) of the Regulation is not acceptable. Point (1) provides that \"paragraph 1 shall not apply to agreements ... where the only parties thereto are undertakings from one Member State and the agreements, decisions or practices do not relate either to imports or to exports between Member States\". As the Court of Justice stated in the case Fonderies Roubaix-Wattrelos of 3 February 1976 (Case 63/75, [1976] ECR 111) : \"This second condition must be interpreted with reference to the structure of Article 4 and its aim of simplifying administrative procedure, which it pursues by not requiring undertakings to notify agreements which, whilst they may be covered by Article 85 (1), appear in general, by reason of their peculiar characteristics, to be less harmful from the point of view of the objectives of this provision and which are therefore very likely to be entitled to the benefit of Article 85 (3).\" In the present case, the Agreement restricts the right to obtain the conformity labels to manufacturers and sole importers (the latter forming the great majority of the parties to the Agreement) and may not benefit from any presumed application of Article 85 (3). Therefore the Agreement relates to imports and exports between Member States within the meaning of Article 4 (2) of Regulation No 17.\n63. In any event, even if the Agreement had been notified, the exemption provided for in Article 85 (3) could not be granted, since the barriers to parallel imports tend to isolate the Belgian market in a manner incompatible with the basic principles of the common market. Moreover, while the Agreement may enable the quality of the water supply to be guaranteed, the provisions restricting competition referred to above are certainly not indispensable to that guarantee. There is also no reason to suppose that these provisions may benefit consumers.\nC. Article 90 (2) of the EEC Treaty\n64. Certain parties to the Agreement claimed that the prohibition under Article 85 does not apply to the Agreement by virtue of Article 90 (2) of the Treaty, since the members of ANSEAU are undertakings entrusted with the operation of services of general economic interest, within the meaning of that Article, and the application of the prohibition would obstruct the performance, in law or in fact, of the particular task assigned to them.\n65. The water-supply companies which are members of ANSEAU and which were set up by the public authorities in order to secure regular supply and distribution of water under conditions which fully guarantee the protection of public health are undertakings entrusted with the operation of services of general economic interest, within the meaning of that Article.\n66. Such undertakings are exempt from the requirement of compliance with the rules on competition only in so far as the application of such rules would obstruct the performance, in law or in fact, of the particular task assigned to them. It is not sufficient in this regard that compliance with the provisions of the Treaty makes the performance of the particular task more complicated. A possible limitation of the application of the rules on competition can be envisaged only in the event that the undertaking concerned has no other technically and economically feasible means of performing its particular task.\n67. In the case in point, the establishment of discriminatory conditions for the authorization of machines imported by importers other than sole importers was not necessary, let alone indispensable, to enable the companies which are members of ANSEAU to perform the task assigned to them. The fact of making it possible for importers other than sole importers to obtain labels on non-discriminatory terms, direct from ANSEAU, could not in any case have obstructed the performance of that task. Article 90 (2) does not, therefore, preclude the application of the prohibition under Article 85 to the said provisions of the Agreement, and there is no need to examine whether the development of trade was likely to be affected to such an extent as would be contrary to the interests of the Community.\nD. Article 3 (1) of Regulation No 17\n68. It is clear from the foregoing considerations that the parties to the Agreement have infringed Article 85 of the EEC Treaty. After receiving the statement of objections, they signified their intention to amend the Agreement, but so far as the Commission is aware they have not in fact done so. Therefore these infringements are still current.\n69. It is, therefore, necessary, pursuant to Article 3 of Regulation No 17, to require the parties to the Agreement to bring these infringements to an end forthwith by amending the Agreement in such a way that it does not prevent importers other than sole importers from obtaining the NAVEWA-ANSEAU conformity labels directly. It is also necessary to require ANSEAU to take all the measures necessary to ensure that such importers may obtain the labels direct from ANSEAU itself, without having to recognize the CEG as their representative, and on non-discriminatory terms by comparison with these granted to manufacturers and sole importers. Those measures must be adequately publicized. The amendments to the Agreement and the measures taken by ANSEAU must be communicated to the Commission within two months of the notification of this Decision.\nE. Article 15 (2) of Regulation No 17\n70. The parties to the Agreement have acted in breach of Article 85 since 1 January 1979 in the case of the original signatories and since the date of their accession to the Agreement in the case of the others. The infringements are still current, as is shown at point 68 above.\n71. It is well known that the Community authorities regularly institute proceedings and impose penalties in respect of measures adopted by undertakings to prevent parallel imports and establish artificial barriers within the European Community, thereby prejudicing the unity of the common market. In the present case, restrictions on parallel imports based on a contractual system of checking conformity with technical requirements are serious infringements of Article 85, since the system is binding upon third parties.\n72. It is, moreover, apparent from the statement of the facts that the undertakings which participated in the drawing-up of the Agreement, namely those referred to in Annex I to this Decision, committed these infringements deliberately, because they were aware of the anti-competitive object of the Agreement. Indeed, the chairmen of the two CEG groups, Laundry Care and Dishwashers, stated on 19 September 1978 that one of the aims of the CEG was to obtain for its members preferential treatment over non-members, who had to have their machines individually checked by ANSEAU, while only the members of the CEG could use the conformity label. The CEG, moreover, stated unequivocally at the meeting on 23 October 1978 that the Agreement had the advantage of constituting a weapon against parallel imports. The responsibility of these undertakings results, on the one hand, from their participation in the drawing-up of the Agreement and, on the other hand, from their status as CEG members, because of the active part taken by the latter in the drawing-up and enforcement of the Agreement.\n73. Therefore it is appropriate that fines should be imposed under Article 15 (2) of Regulation No 17 on the undertakings which took part in the drawing-up of the Agreement. It must be noted that, because of their participation in the drawing-up of the Agreement and their status as CEG members, all these undertakings bear the same responsibility. Moreover, the amounts of the fines imposed upon them must take into account the particular context in which the infringement was committed and the individual positions of those undertakings on the relevant market.\n74. On the other hand, the undertakings which became parties to the Agreement after its signature, namely those referred to in Annex II to this Decision, took no initiative in the drawing-up of the Agreement and were practically obliged to participate. Therefore no fine should be imposed upon them.\n75. It must also be noted that the most important part of the responsibility for the infringement lies with ANSEAU. The fact that the members of ANSEAU are entrusted by the public authorities with the operation of services of general economic interest made it possible to present the Agreement as being an obligatory agreement and thus to give it binding force vis-à-vis third parties who were not party to the Agreement. ANSEAU should, therefore, have paid particular attention to ensuring that the system instituted for checking the conformity of washing-machines and dishwashers could not be anti-competitive and discriminatory. ANSEAU did allow the Agreement to have such an objective, even though its group of legal experts had drawn its attention to the fact that the Agreement made it possible to check 90 % of production and that a solution must be found to enable the conformity labels to be made available to the remaining 10 %, which was never done. Moreover, ANSEAU and the representatives of the CEG, the FCAE and UFARAL were present at the meeting on 26 October 1978, at which the participants stated that, thanks to the publicity campaign which would be undertaken to encourage consumers to purchase only machines bearing the conformity label, the sales of other machines would drop, even those which conformed to the ANSEAU rules. Therefore ANSEAU committed the infringements through gross negligence.\n76. It is therefore also appropriate to impose a fine on ANSEAU pursuant to Article 15 (2) of Regulation No 17. Although ANSEAU bears the most important part of the responsibility, as it is a non-profit-making body, the fine must be equal in amount to the largest fines imposed on the undertakings which took part in the drawing-up of the Agreement,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\nArticle 1\nThe provisions of the Agreement concerning the use of the NAVEWA-ANSEAU conformity label concluded on 13 December 1978 in Brussels, Belgium, excluding the possibility for importers other than sole importers to obtain a conformity check for the washing-machines and dishwashers which they import into Belgium under conditions which are not discriminatory by comparison with those which apply to manufacturers and sole importers, constitute infringements of Article 85 (1) of the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community. This applies in particular to Articles 2, 4.1, 5 and 6 of the said Agreement and to Article 6 of the special rules annexed to that Agreement.\nArticle 2\nThe parties to the Agreement shall forthwith bring to an end the infringements established in Article 1.

By reason of the amendments of Regulation (EC) No 1868/94 by the Treaty of Accession of the Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia, and by the Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 of 29 September 2003 establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers and amending Regulations (EEC) No 2019/93, (EC) No 1452/2001, (EC) No 1453/2001, (EC) No 1454/2001, (EC) 1868/94, (EC) No 1251/1999, (EC) No 1254/1999, (EC) No 1673/2000, (EEC) No 2358/71 and (EC) No 2529/2001, Regulation (EC) No 97/95 should be adapted in order to take into account those amendments. For the sake of clarity and legal certainty, it is therefore necessary to repeal Regulation (EC) No 97/95 and to replace it by a new text.\n(2) In order to benefit from the Community aid under the system of quotas laid down by Regulation (EC) No 1868/94, undertakings producing potato starch should conclude cultivation contracts with potato producers.\n(3) It is necessary to specify what matters should be covered by a cultivation contract between an undertaking producing potato starch and a producer so as to prevent the conclusion of contracts in excess of the undertaking's subquota. Such undertakings should be prohibited from accepting delivery of potatoes not covered by a cultivation contract, as this would put at risk the effectiveness of the quota system and the requirement that the minimum price set out in Article 4a of Regulation (EC) No 1868/94 be paid for all potatoes intended for starch production. Nevertheless, it should be possible, where climatic reasons lead to production in the areas covered by the cultivation contract of a larger quantity of potatoes or of potatoes with a higher starch content than was originally foreseen, for an undertaking producing potato starch to accept such potatoes provided that it pays the minimum price.\n(4) Potatoes having a starch content of less than 13 % cannot be considered potatoes intended for the manufacture of potato starch. Potatoes with a starch content of less than 13 % should not be accepted by starch-producing undertakings. The Commission should, where climatic reasons lead to a lower starch content, and at the request of a Member State, be able to authorise the acceptance of potatoes having a starch content lower than 13 % under certain conditions.\n(5) It is necessary to define acceptable methods for determining the underwater weight of potatoes and to provide a table showing the corresponding starch content and aid payable.\n(6) Inspection measures should be introduced to ensure that only starch produced in accordance with the provisions of this Regulation gives rise to payment of the premium. In order to protect producers of potatoes intended for the production of starch, it is essential for the minimum price set out in Article 4(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1868/94 to be paid for all potatoes. It is therefore necessary to provide for sanctions where the minimum price has not been paid, or where starch-producing undertakings have accepted potatoes not covered by a cultivation contract.\n(7) Rules are necessary to ensure that potato starch produced in excess of a starch-producing undertaking's subquota is exported without export refund, as is required by Article 6(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1868/94. Sanctions should be applied in the event of any breach.\n(8) It is necessary to specify what will happen to the subquota of starch-producing undertakings which merge, change ownership or cease trading.\n(9) It is necessary to enable the Member States and the Commission to control the operation of the quota system. The information to be communicated by undertakings producing potato starch to the Member State, and by the Member State to the Commission, should be specified.\n(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I DEFINITIONS - QUOTA SYSTEM\nArticle 1\nFor the purposes of this Regulation, the following definitions shall apply:\n(a) quota: the quota laid down for each Member State by Article 2(1) and (3) of Regulation (EC) No 1868/94;\n(b) subquota: that part of the quota allocated by the Member State to a starch-producing undertaking;\n(c) starch-producing undertaking: any natural or legal person established on the territory of the Member State concerned which receives the subquota and premium referred to in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1868/94;\n(d) producer: any natural or legal person or group of such persons, which delivers to a starch-producing undertaking potatoes produced by itself or its members, in its own name and on its own behalf under a cultivation contract concluded by itself or in its own name;\n(e) cultivation contract: any contract concluded between a producer or group of producers and the starch-producing undertaking;\n(f) potatoes: potatoes intended for the manufacture of potato starch as referred to in Article 93 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 and having a starch content of at least 13 %;\n(g) unprocessed starch: starch produced under CN code 1108 13 00 which has not undergone any processing;\n(h) merger of starch-producing undertakings: the consolidation into a single undertaking of two or more starch-producing undertakings;\n(i) transfer of ownership of a starch-producing undertaking: the assignment or absorption of the assets of an undertaking holding a subquota, to one or more starch-producing undertakings;\n(j) transfer of ownership of a starch factory: the assignment of ownership of a technical unit, including all the plant required to manufacture starch, to one or more undertakings, resulting in the partial or total absorption of the outpost of the undertaking making the assignment;\n(k) lease of a factory: the leasehold contract of a technical unit including all the plant required for the manufacture of starch, with a view to its operation, concluded for a period of at least three consecutive marketing years with an undertaking which is established within the same Member State as the factory in question, if, after the lease takes effect, the undertaking which rents the factory can be considered a single starch-producing undertaking for its entire production;\n(l) aid for starch potato: aid established for farmers producing potatoes intended for the manufacturing of potato starch referred to in Article 93 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003.\nArticle 2\nWhere Article 6(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1868/94 applies, the subquotas allocated shall be adjusted accordingly at the beginning of the marketing year following that in which the quota was exceeded.\nCHAPTER II PRICE AND PAYMENT SYSTEM\nArticle 3\n1. A cultivation contract shall be concluded for each marketing year. Each contract shall have an identification number and include at least the following information:\n(a) the name and address of the producer or group of producers;\n(b) the name and address of the starch-producing undertaking;\n(c) the areas cultivated, expressed in hectares with two decimals and identified in conformity with Commission Regulation (EC) No 2419/2001(3) on the integrated administration and control system (IACS);\n(d) the foreseen quantity of potatoes in tonnes to be harvested there and delivered to the starch-producing undertaking;\n(e) the foreseen average starch content of the potatoes, based on the average starch content of the potatoes delivered by the producer to the starch-producing undertaking over the last three marketing years or, if such information is not available, on the average content for the area of supply;\n(f) a commitment by the starch-producing undertaking to pay the producer the minimum price referred to in Article 4a of Regulation (EC) No 1868/94.\n2. Each starch-producing undertaking shall forward to the competent authority before the beginning of the marketing year a summary of the contracts, including for each contract, the identification number, the name of the producer, the areas cultivated, and the tonnage contracted, expressed in terms of starch equivalent, before a date to be fixed by the Member State before the beginning of the marketing year, in order to ensure the necessary controls.\n3. The total in starch equivalent of the quantities listed in the cultivation contracts shall not exceed the subquota established for that starch-producing undertaking.\n4. Where the quantity actually produced under the cultivation contract in starch equivalent exceeds the quantity stated in the contract, that quantity may be delivered, if the starch-producing undertaking so chooses, provided the minimum price referred to in Article 4a of Regulation (EC) No 1868/94 is paid for it.\n5. A starch-producing undertaking may not take delivery of potatoes not covered by a cultivation contract.\nArticle 4\n1. Delivery of potatoes shall take place either at the starch-producing undertakings themselves or at their delivery points.\n2. The determination the weight of the potatoes and the starch content, in conformity with Articles 5 and 7, shall be carried out at the time of delivery and under the authority of an inspector approved by the Member State.\nArticle 5\n1. Where so required for the purposes of one of the methods referred to in Annex I of Regulation (EC) No 2235/2003(4), the gross weight of the potatoes shall be determined for each load at the time of delivery by comparative weighing of the means of transport used, loaded and empty.\n2. The net weight of the potatoes shall be determined by one of the methods described in Annex I of Regulation (EC) No 2235/2003.\n3. Accepted consignments must have a starch content of not less than 13 %.\nHowever, starch-producing undertakings may accept consignments of potatoes with a starch content below 13 %, provided that the quantity of starch that can be manufactured from these potatoes does not exceed 1 % of the subquota. The minimum price to be paid in this case shall be that valid for a starch content of 13 %.\nArticle 6\nThe starch content of the potatoes shall be determined on the basis of an underwater weight valid for 5050 grams of potatoes supplied.\nThe water used shall be clean and without additives and its temperature shall be less than 18 °C.\nArticle 7\n1. The premium shall be granted to starch-producing undertakings in respect of starch produced from potatoes of sound and fair marketable quality, on the basis of the quantity of potatoes used and their starch content, at the rates laid down in Annex II of Regulation (EC) No 2235/2003 up to the quantity of starch for which they hold a subquota. No premium shall be granted for starch produced from potatoes that are not of sound and fair marketable quality nor for starch produced from potatoes whose starch content is below 13 %, except where the second subparagraph of Article 5(3) applies.\nWhere the starch content of the potatoes is calculated by Reimann's or Parrow's scale and corresponds to a figure appearing on two or three lines in the second column in Annex II of Regulation (EC) No 2235/2003, the rates applicable shall be those for the second or third line.\n2. Where the batches delivered contain 25 % or more of potatoes which can pass through a screen with a square mesh of 28 mm (hereinafter described as \"tailings\"), the net weight used for determining the minimum price to be paid by the starch manufacturer shall be reduced as follows:\nTABLE\nIf the batches contain more than 50 % of tailings, they shall be dealt with by mutual agreement and no premium shall be paid thereon.\nThe percentage of tailings shall be determined at the same time as the net weight.\n3. Observance of the limits of the subquota by the starch-producing undertakings shall be determined on the basis of the quantity and starch content of the potatoes used, in accordance with the rates laid down in Annex II of Regulation (EC) No 2235/2003.\nArticle 8\n1. A receipt form shall be drawn up under the joint responsibility of the starch-producing undertaking, the approved inspector and the supplier. The starch-producing undertaking shall deliver a copy to the producer and retain the original so that it may, if necessary, be submitted to the agency responsible for the monitoring of premiums.\n2. The receipt form shall contain at least the following information where this appears from operations carried out pursuant to Articles 4 to 7:\n(a) date of delivery;\n(b) delivery number;\n(c) number of the cultivation contract;\n(d) name and address of the potato producer;\n(e) weight of the means of transport on arrival at the starch factory or delivery point;\n(f) weight of the means of transport after unloading and removal of residual earth;\n(g) gross weight of the delivery;\n(h) reduction for extraneous matter and weight of water absorbed during washing, expressed as a percentage and applied to the gross weight of the delivery;\n(i) reduction, expressed in weight, applied to the gross weight of the delivery as a result of extraneous matter;\n(j) percentage of tailings;\n(k) total net weight of the delivery (gross weight less the reduction, including the correction for tailings);\n(l) starch content, expressed as a percentage or underwater weight;\n(m) unit price to be paid.\nArticle 9\nFor each producer, the starch-producing undertaking shall draw up a summary payment slip containing the following particulars:\n(a) business name of the starch-producing undertaking;\n(b) name and address of the potato producer;\n(c) cultivation contract number;\n(d) date and number of the receipt forms;\n(e) net weight of each delivery after any reductions as provided for in Article 8(2);\n(f) unit price per delivery;\n(g) total amount due to the grower;\n(h) sums paid to the potato producer and date of payments;\n(i) signature and stamp of the starch manufacturer.\nCHAPTER III PAYMENTS - PENALTIES\nArticle 10\n1.

The proof referred to in paragraph 1 shall be furnished by submission of the summary payment slip provided for in Article 9, accompanied either by certification of payment by the producer or by a voucher issued by the financial undertaking that made the payment on the order of the starch manufacturer, certifying that such payment has been made.\n3. The premium for starch producing undertakings shall be paid by the Member State on whose territory the potato starch was manufactured within four months following the date on which the proof referred to in paragraph 1 was furnished.\nArticle 11\n1. The Member States shall introduce inspection arrangements for on-the-spot verification of the operations conferring entitlement to the premium and compliance with the subquota laid down for each starch-producing undertaking. In order to carry out such checks, inspectors shall have access to the stock records and accounts of undertakings and to manufacturing and storage premises.\nDuring each processing period, inspection shall cover the entire processing of at least 10 % of the potatoes supplied to the starch-producing undertaking.\n2. Member States shall inform each starch-producing undertaking, as appropriate, of the amounts of starch by which it has exceeded its subquota.\n3. Should the competent body establish that the requirement specified in the second indent of Article 10(1) has not been respected by the starch-producing undertaking, that undertaking shall, in the absence of force majeure, lose entitlement to premiums, in whole or in part, as follows:\n- if the requirement has not been observed in respect of a quantity of starch less than 20 % of the total quantity of starch produced by the undertaking, the premium granted shall be reduced by five times the percentage in question,\n- if the percentage in question is 20 or more, no premium shall be granted.\n4.

When the unprocessed starch produced by a starch-producing undertaking is stored for export in a silo, warehouse or bin outside the factory of the manufacturer in the Member State of production, or in any other Member State, where other unprocessed starch produced by other undertakings or by the same one is also stored so that the products so stored cannot be physically distinguished, all such products shall be placed under administrative supervision offering guarantees equivalent to those of the customs services until the export declaration referred to in Article 12(1)(b) has been accepted, and shall be placed under customs supervision as soon as the declaration is accepted.\nIn the circumstances referred to in the first subparagraph when withdrawal from stock occurs before acceptance of the export declaration referred to in Article 12(1)(b), a proof shall be provided by the competent authorities of the Member State where storage took place.\nWhen withdrawal from stock occurs after acceptance of the export declaration referred to in Article 12(1)(b), a proof within the meaning of Article 33(2)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 shall be provided by the customs authorities of the Member State where storage took place.\nThe proof referred to in the second and third subparagraphs shall testify to the withdrawal from stock of the product in question or the corresponding substitute quantity within the meaning of the first subparagraph.\nArticle 14\nWhere unprocessed starch produced by a starch-producing undertaking is stored loose under the customs warehousing or free-zone procedure for the advance refund as defined in Council Regulation (EEC) No 565/80(9), that starch may, in addition to the operations referred to in Article 29(4) of Regulation (EC) No 800/1999, also be mixed in the same storage place with other starches falling within the same subheading of the nomenclature used for the refunds, which have the same technical characteristics and fulfil the conditions required for the granting of export refunds and are also placed under the arrangements provided for by Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 or Regulation (EEC) No 565/80.\nArticle 15\n1.

The Member State concerned shall, before 1 May following 1 January as specified in Article 12(1)(b), notify the starch-producing undertakings of the total amount to be paid.\nThat total amount shall be paid by the starch-producing undertakings in question no later than 20 May of that year.\nArticle 16\n1. In the event of the merger of starch-producing undertakings, the Member State shall allocate to the undertaking resulting from the merger a subquota equal to the sum of the subquotas allocated prior to the merger to the starch-producing undertakings concerned;\nIn the event of the transfer of ownership of a starch-producing undertaking, the Member State shall allocate to the transferee undertaking the subquota of the undertaking transferred. Where there is more than one transferee undertaking, the subquota shall be allocated in proportion to the production of starch which each has absorbed;\nIn the event of the transfer ownership of a starch factory, the Member State shall reduce the subquota of the undertaking transferring ownership of the factory and increase the subquota of the starch-producing undertaking or undertakings purchasing the factory in question by the quantity deducted, in proportion to the production absorbed.\n2. In the event of the closure, in circumstances other than those referred to in paragraph 1, of a starch-producing undertaking, or of one or more factories of a starch-producing undertaking, the Member State may allocate the subquotas involved by such closure to one or more starch-producing undertakings.\n3. In the event of the lease of a factory belonging to a starch-producing undertaking, the Member State shall reduce the subquota of the undertaking which offers the factory for rent and shall allocate the portion by which the subquota was reduced to the undertaking which rents the factory in order to produce starch in it.\nIf the lease is terminated before the term referred to in Article 1(k), the adjustment of the subquota pursuant to the preceding subparagraph shall be cancelled retroactively by the Member State as from the date on which the lease took effect.\n4. If following the application of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1 production ceases in the factories of one or more of the starch-producing undertakings that have merged, thus seriously threatening the continuing production of potatoes for the manufacture of starch in the area which had previously supplied this undertaking or these undertakings, the Member State may direct the merged undertaking to transfer to the Member State the subquota initially allocated to the enterprise whose factories have since ceased production. Any quota transferred in accordance with the first subparagraph may be reallocated by the Member State to any starch-producing undertaking that undertakes to manufacture the starch in the area concerned.\nArticle 17\nWhen the closure of the undertaking or factory, the merger or transfer occurs between 1 July and 31 March of the following year, the measures referred to in Article 16 shall take effect for the marketing year current during that period.\nWhen the closure of the undertaking or factory, the merger or transfer occurs between 1 April and 30 June of the same year, the measures referred to in Article 16 shall take effect for the marketing year following that period.\nCHAPTER IV NOTIFICATIONS\nArticle 18\nBy 30 April of each marketing year at the latest, the starch-producing undertakings shall notify the competent authorities of:\n- the quantities of starch potatoes which have benefited from the aid provided for in Article 93 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003,\n- the quantities of potato starch on which the premium provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1868/94 has been paid.\nArticle 19\n1.

These derogations relate to the entry/exit schemes referred to in Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002, and the aid for the renewal and modernisation of the fleet referred to in Council Regulation (EC) No 2792/1999 (3).\n(2)\nUnder Regulation (EC) No 639/2004, for France and Portugal the specific reference levels for the fleet segments registered in the outermost regions are the multiannual guidance programme (MAGP IV) objectives at the end of 2002.\n(3)\nFor the Canary Islands, the specific reference levels are to be fixed using an approach similar to that used to fix the MAGP IV objectives, taking into account the limits of the fishing opportunities available to the fleets in question. To this end the Scientific Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF) delivered an opinion in its March/April 2004 session report on the fishing opportunities of fleets registered in the Canary Islands. Spain and the Commission have also examined the fishing opportunities of fleets registered to the Canary Islands and active under bilateral and multilateral agreements. According to the Commission, none of these examinations or reports has revealed any possibility of expansion of the fleets currently registered in the Canary Islands.\n(4)\nThe Member States must report on changes in the fleets registered in the outermost regions in the annual report referred to in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1438/2003 of 12 August 2003 laying down implementing rules on the Community Fleet Policy as defined in Chapter III of Council Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 (4).\n(5)\nThe Commission has taken account of its declaration in the margins of the Council of 30 March 2004 (5) on the detailed implementing rules for Regulation (EC) No 639/2004, in particular as regards the most appropriate segmentation in relation to types of fishing, scientific opinions on the state of targeted stocks and similar treatment of fleets operating on the same fisheries.\n(6)\nThis Regulation must apply from the date of application of Regulation (EC) No 639/2004.\n(7)\nThe measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Fisheries and Aquaculture,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nSpecific reference levels\nThe specific reference levels for the fleets registered in the outermost regions of France, Portugal and Spain are fixed in the Annex hereto for each fleet segment.\nThese specific reference levels are the maximum capacity levels, in GT and in kW, that the Member States shall be authorised to accept through entries to the fleet by way of derogation from Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002.\nArticle 2\nMonitoring specific reference levels\nFor each of the segments referred to in Article 1, the reference level in terms of tonnage and power on any date after 31 December 2002 shall be equal to the reference level for that segment, as fixed in the Annex hereto, minus the tonnage and power of the vessels in that segment leaving the fleet after 31 December 2002 as a result of public aid.\nArticle 3\nConsolidation of reference levels\nOn 31 December 2006, the Commission shall calculate for each Member State the total capacities in terms of GT and kW of the fleets registered in the outermost regions and of the entries into these fleets decided in accordance with the provisions of Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 639/2004 which are not yet registered on that date.\nThis figure shall be added to the reference levels of the mainland fleet.

To this end the Commission is empowered to borrow, on behalf of the Community, the necessary resources that will be placed at the disposal of the Slovak Republic in the form of a loan.\n3. This loan will be managed by the Commission in close consultation with the Monetary Committee and in a manner consistent with any agreement reached between the IMF and the Slovak Republic.\nArticle 2\n1.

one is intended to take account of the quantity of milk products and is calculated by multiplying the basic amount by the milk products content in the product concerned; the other is intended to take account of the quantity of added sucrose and is calculated by multiplying the sucrose content of the entire product by the basic amount of the refund valid on the day of exportation for the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector (3), however, this second component is applied only if the added sucrose has been produced using sugar beet or cane harvested in the Community.\n(7)\nCommission Regulation (EEC) No 896/84 (4) laid down additional provisions concerning the granting of refunds on the change from one milk year to another; those provisions provide for the possibility of varying refunds according to the date of manufacture of the products.\n(8)\nFor the calculation of the refund for processed cheese provision must be made where casein or caseinates are added for that quantity not to be taken into account.\n(9)\nIt follows from applying the rules set out above to the present situation on the market in milk and in particular to quotations or prices for milk products within the Community and on the world market that the refund should be as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.\n(10)\nThe Management Committee for Milk and Milk Products has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its chairman,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nThe export refunds referred to in Article 31 of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 on products exported in the natural state shall be as set out in the Annex.\nArticle 2\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on 15 April 2005.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\nDone at Brussels, 14 April 2005.",

In order to qualify for this scheme, their annual turnover must not exceed SEK 3 000 000 for Sweden and GBP 1 350 000 for the United Kingdom.\n(2)\nSweden and the United Kingdom have requested authorisation to extend this special derogating measure by letters registered by the Commission’s Secretariat-General on 3 March 2009 for Sweden and on 15 January 2009 for the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom has also asked that the ceiling for the annual turnover for the scheme be raised to GBP 1 500 000.\n(3)\nIn accordance with Article 395(2) of Directive 2006/112/EC, by letters of 9 July 2009, the Commission informed the other Member States of the request made by Sweden and the United Kingdom and, by letters of 13 July 2009 the Commission notified Sweden and the United Kingdom that it had all the information it considered necessary for appraisal of the request.\n(4)\nThe cash accounting scheme is a simplified optional scheme intended for small undertakings which do not qualify for tax exemption. It enables such taxable persons to apply a simple rule based on the date of payment for their input and output transactions, to determine at what point they must exercise their right to deduct VAT and pay the tax to the revenue authorities. This scheme thus constitutes for those taxable persons a simplification measure which can, furthermore, create a cash-flow advantage for them.\n(5)\nOn 28 January 2009, the Commission presented a directive aimed at amending Directive 2006/112/EC as regards the rules on invoicing and enabling the Member States to postpone the right to deduct VAT arising until it has been paid to the supplier in respect of taxable persons with an annual turnover not exceeding a ceiling, which could be fixed by Member States at up to EUR 2 000 000, and accordingly entitled to use an optional scheme under which the VAT to which their transactions are liable does not become chargeable until they have received the payment.\n(6)\nThe special derogating measure does not affect the amount of VAT revenue collected by Sweden or the United Kingdom at the final consumption stage and has no impact on the European Union’s own resources accruing from VAT,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\nArticle 1\nBy way of derogation from Article 167 of Directive 2006/112/EC, Sweden and the United Kingdom are authorised to postpone the right of deduction of value added tax (VAT) in respect of taxable persons, as defined in the second paragraph, until it has been paid to the supplier of goods or of services.\nThe taxable persons concerned must have opted for a scheme under which the VAT on their supplies of goods and of services becomes chargeable on receipt of the payment. Under the scheme, their annual turnover must not exceed SEK 3 000 000 for Sweden and GBP 1 500 000 for the United Kingdom.\nArticle 2\nThis Decision shall apply from 1 January 2010 until the date of entry into force of a directive authorising the Member States to postpone the right of deduction of VAT until it has been paid to the supplier of goods or of services in respect of taxable persons whose annual turnover does not exceed a certain ceiling and who therefore benefit from an optional scheme according to which the tax on their supplies of goods and of services becomes chargeable when they have received the payment. In any event, this Decision shall apply until 31 December 2012 at the latest.\nArticle 3\nThis Decision is addressed to the Kingdom of Sweden and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\nDone at Brussels, 7 December 2009.",

The Council, acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, may extend this period.\n3.

Member States may prohibit the marketing in their territory of leaded petrol having a motor octane number (MON) lower than 85 at the pump and a research octane number (RON) lower than 95 at the pump if such a measure is justified on grounds of the protection of human health and the environment and promotes the availability and balanced distribution of unleaded petrol within their territory in accordance with Article 3 (1).\n5. If a Member State introduces into its rules the prohibition referred to in paragraph 4, it shall give at least six months' notice to the Commission and to the public. The Commission shall immediately inform the other Member States.

whereas the revenue of the Office should in principle be sufficient to balance the budget of the Office; whereas such revenues should be afforded by the fees to be paid for the official acts set out in the Basic Regulation and in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1239/95 of 31 May 1995 establishing implementing rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 2100/94 as regards proceedings before the Community Plant Variety Office (2) (the Proceedings Regulation) as well as by annual fees payable for the duration of a Community plant variety right;\nWhereas a subsidy from the general budget of the European Communities may cover the expenditure on the initial running phase of the Office for the transitional period defined in Article 113 (3) (b) of the Regulation; whereas an extension of that period by one year is possible by virtue of the same provision;\nWhereas such extension of the transitional period should be considered if sufficient experience has not been gained for setting reasonable levels of fees ensuring the principle of self-financing whilst safeguarding the attractiveness of the Community system of plant variety protection; whereas such experience could only be gained by observing the number of applications for a Community plant variety right, the costs paid to the Examination Offices and the actual duration of Community plant variety rights granted;\nWhereas the level of the fees should be based on the principles of sound financial management within the Office, and in particular economy and cost-effectiveness;\nWhereas, in the interests of a simplified handling by the staff of the Office, the fees should be not only laid down, but also charged and paid in the same currency unit as is used for the budget of the Office;\nWhereas the application fee should be a uniform fee covering only the processing of an application for a Community plant variety right made in respect of any given plant species;\nWhereas the time limit for the payment of the application fee under Article 51 of the Basic Regulation should be considered as the period between the acts necessary for making the payment and the actual receipt of such payment by the Office, in particular in the need for a rapid recovery of costs already incurred by the Office on the one hand and for the facilitating of an effective filing of applications in the light of possibly long distances between applicant and Office, on the other;\nWhereas the total of the examination fees which are charged for a technical examination should, in principle, balance the total fees to be paid by the Office to all Examination Offices; whereas costs for the maintenance of the reference collection should not necessarily be covered entirely by the examination fees charged; whereas the level of examination fee should vary between three groups of plant species in the light of experience available from existing national arrangements for plant variety protection;\nWhereas the annual fees for the duration of a Community plant variety right should constitute an extra source of revenue for the Office, but should, inter alia, cover costs relating to the technical verification of varieties after the grant of a Community plant variety right and, in consequence, should follow the grouping established for the examination fees;\nWhereas the appeal fee should be uniform in order to cover the main cost components relating to appeal proceedings, with the expection of costs relating to a technical examination pursuant to Articles 55 and 56 of the Basic Regulation or to any taking of evidence; whereas two different dates for payment of the application free should serve as an incentive to appellants to reconsider their appeal in the light of the decisions taken by the Office pursuant to Article 70 (2) of the Basic Regulation;\nWhereas other fees in respect of specific requests shall in principle cover costs incurred in their processing by the Office, including the taking of decisions on such requests;\nWhereas to ensure flexibility in the management of costs, the President of the Office should be empowered to lay down the fees payable for examination reports which already exist at the date of application and are not available to the Office, and for specific services rendered;\nWhereas surcharges may be levied in order to reduce unnecessary costs to the Office arising from a lack of cooperation on the part of particular applicants for, or holders of, Community plant variety rights;\nWhereas in the light of Article 117 of the Basic Regulation, this Regulation should enter into force as soon as possible;\nWhereas the Administrative Council of the Office has been consulted;\nWhereas the provisions provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Variety Rights,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nScope\n1. Fees due to the Office, as provided for in the Basic Regulation and the Proceedings Regulation, shall be charged in accordance with this Regulation.\n2. The fees due to the Office shall be laid down, charged and paid in ecus.\n3. Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall apply mutatis mutandis to any surcharge, due to the Office.\n4. Details of the fees which may be charged by authorities of Member States by virtue of provisions of the Basic Regulation or this Regulation shall be governed by the relevant national rules of the Member States concerned.\n5. Where the President of the Office is empowered to take a decision as to the amount of fees and the way in which they are to be paid, such decisions shall be published in the Official Gazette of the Office.\nArticle 2\nGeneral provisions\n1.

Documentary evidence shall be regarded as 'sufficient` within the meaning of paragraph 3 if an acknowledgement of provision of the transfer order, issued by a banking establishment or a post office, is produced.\nArticle 5\nName of the person making the payment and the purpose of payment\n1. A person making a payment of fees or surcharges shall indicate in writing his name and the purpose of such payment.\n2. If the Office cannot establish the purpose of a payment, it shall require the person having made the payment to inform it thereof in writing within two months. If the purpose is not indicated within that period, the payment shall be deemed not to have been made and shall be refunded to the person having made it.\nArticle 6\nUnderpayment\nA time-limit for payment of fees or surcharges shall, in principle, be deemed to have been observed only if the full amount of the fee or surcharge has been paid in due time. If the fees or surcharges are not paid in full, the amount which has been paid shall be refunded after any time-limit for payment has expired. The Office may, however, where this is considered justified, overlook any small deficiencies, without prejudicing the rights of the person making the payment.\nArticle 7\nApplication fee\n1.

The creation of common statistical standards for labour cost indices can only be achieved on the basis of a Community legal act because only the Commission can coordinate the necessary harmonisation of statistical information at Community level, while the collection of data and compilation of comparable labour cost indices can be organised by the Member States.\n(6) Council Regulation (EC) No 322/97 of 17 February 1997 on Community statistics(5) provides the general framework for the production of labour cost indices under this Regulation.\n(7) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(6).\n(8) The Statistical Programme Committee (SPC), established by Council Decision 89/382/EEC, Euratom(7), has been consulted in accordance with Article 3 of that Decision,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nObjective\nThe objective of this Regulation is to establish a common framework for the production, transmission and evaluation of comparable labour cost indices in the Community. Member States shall produce labour cost indices for the economic activities defined in Article 4.\nArticle 2\nDefinitions\n1. The labour cost index (LCI) is defined as the Laspeyres index of labour costs per hour worked, chain linked annually and based upon a fixed structure of economic activity at NACE Rev.1 section level, where NACE Rev.1 is the classification established by Council Regulation (EEC) No 3037/90 of 9 October 1990 on the statistical classification of economic activities in the European Community(8). Further disaggregations of NACE Rev.1 sections, to be included in the fixed structure, shall be defined in accordance with Article 4(1). The formula to be used for the calculation of the LCI is defined in the Annex to this Regulation.\n2. The labour costs are the total quarterly costs incurred by the employer in the employment of labour. The labour cost items and total staff employed are defined by reference to Annex II, Sections A and D (items D.1, D.4 and D.5 and their subcomponents, excluding items D.2 and D.3) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1726/1999 of 27 July 1999 implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 530/1999 concerning structural statistics on earnings and on labour costs as regards the definition and transmission of information on labour costs(9).\n3. The hours worked are defined by reference to Council Regulation (EC) No 2223/96 of 25 June 1996 on the European system of national and regional accounts in the Community(10), Annex A, Chapter 11, paragraphs 11.26 to 11.31.\n4. Technical specification of the index, including revisions to the weighting structure, can be redefined in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 12(2).\nArticle 3\nScope\n1. This Regulation shall apply to all activities defined in sections C to O of NACE Rev.1.\n2. The inclusion of economic activities defined by NACE Rev.1 sections L, M, N and O in the scope of this Regulation shall be determined in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 12(2), taking into account the feasibility studies defined in Article 10.\n3. The LCI shall represent all statistical units as defined in Council Regulation (EEC) No 696/93 of 15 March 1993 on the statistical units for the observation and analysis of the production system in the Community(11).\nArticle 4\nBreakdown of variables\n1. The data shall be broken down by economic activities defined by NACE Rev.1 sections and by further disaggregations, not beyond the level of NACE Rev.1 divisions (2 digit level) or groupings of divisions, taking account of contributions to total employment and to labour costs at Community and national levels, defined in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 12(2). Labour cost indices shall be provided separately for the three labour cost categories identified below:\n(a) total labour costs;\n(b) wages and salaries, defined by reference to item D.11 in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1726/1999;\n(c) employers' social contributions plus taxes paid by the employer less subsidies received by the employer, as defined by the sum of items D.12 and D.4 less D.5 in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1726/1999.\n2. An index estimating total labour costs, excluding bonuses, where bonuses are defined by D.11112 in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1726/1999, shall be provided, broken down by economic activities defined in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 12(2), and shall be based on the NACE Rev.1 classification, taking into account the feasibility studies defined in Article 10.\nArticle 5\nFrequency and back data\n1. The data for the LCI shall first be compiled for the first quarter of 2003, and thereafter for each quarter (ending on 31 March, 30 June, 30 September and 31 December of each year).\n2. Back data covering the period from the first quarter of 1996 to the fourth quarter of 2002 shall be made available by the Member States. The back data shall be provided for each of the NACE Rev.1 sections C to K and for the labour cost items mentioned in Article 4(1).\nArticle 6\nTransmission of results\n1. The data referred to in Article 4 shall be supplied in index form. The weights used to calculate the index, defined in the Annex to this Regulation, shall be made available for publication at the same time.\nThe appropriate technical format to be used for the transmission of the results referred to in Article 4, and the adjustment procedures to be applied to the data shall be defined in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 12(2).\n2. Member States shall transmit the data, broken down as specified in Article 4, to the Commission (Eurostat) within 70 days of the end of the reference period. Metadata, defined as the explanations needed to interpret the changes in the data either arising from methodological or technical changes, or due to changes in the labour market, shall be delivered with the data.\n3. The back data referred to in Article 5 shall be transmitted to the Commission (Eurostat) at the same time as the LCI for the first quarter of 2003.\nArticle 7\nSources\nMember States may produce the necessary estimates by using a combination of different sources specified below by applying the principle of administrative simplification:\n(a) surveys, where statistical units, as defined in Regulation (EEC) No 696/93, are asked to give timely, accurate and complete information;\n(b) other appropriate sources, including administrative data if these are appropriate in terms of timeliness and relevance;\n(c) appropriate statistical estimation procedures.\nArticle 8\nQuality\n1. The current data and back data transmitted shall satisfy separate quality criteria to be defined under the procedure referred to in Article 12(2).\n2. The Member States shall provide annual quality reports to the Commission, beginning in 2003. The content of the reports shall be defined under the procedure referred to in Article 12(2).\nArticle 9\nTransition periods and derogations\n1. Transition periods relating to the implementation of this Regulation may be granted under the procedure referred to in Article 12(2), not extending more than two years from the date of entry into force of this Regulation.\n2. During the transition periods, derogations from this Regulation may be accepted by the Commission insofar as the national statistical systems require major adaptations.\nArticle 10\nFeasibility studies\n1. The Commission shall, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 12(2), institute a series of feasibility studies, to be undertaken by the Member States, in particular by those which cannot provide the data for NACE Rev. 1 sections L, M, N, and O (Article 3(2)) or the breakdown of the index estimating total labour costs, excluding bonuses (Article 4(2)).\n2. The feasibility studies shall be carried out, taking into account the benefits of collecting the data in relation to the cost of collection and the burden on business, to assess:\n(a) how the quarterly labour cost indices defined in Article 4(1) can be obtained for NACE sections L, M, N and O; and\n(b) how the index estimating total labour costs, excluding bonuses, defined in Article 4(2) can be obtained.\n3.

The minimum price referred to in Article 1 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 1035/77 shall be 20,60 ECU per 100 kilograms net for the 1985/86 marketing year.\n2. The said minimum price shall be in respect of products ex-producer's packaging station.\nArticle 2\nThe amount of the financial compensation referred to in Article 2 of Regulation (EEC) No 1035/77 shall be 12,25 ECU per 100 kilograms net for the 1985/86 marketing year.\nArticle 3\n1. By way of derogation from Article 1 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1045/77, contracts for the first part of the 1985/86 marketing year may be concluded until 31 July 1985.\n2. By way of derogation from Article 1 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 1045/77, supplementary agreements to the contracts referred to in paragraph 1 may be concluded until 30 September 1985.\nArticle 4\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nIt shall apply from 1 June 1985.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\nDone at Brussels, 5 June 1985.",

The concept of universal service should evolve to reflect advances in technology, market developments and changes in user demand. The regulatory framework established for the full liberalisation of the telecommunications market in 1998 in the Community defined the minimum scope of universal service obligations and established rules for its costing and financing.\n(2) Under Article 153 of the Treaty, the Community is to contribute to the protection of consumers.\n(3) The Community and its Member States have undertaken commitments on the regulatory framework of telecommunications networks and services in the context of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) agreement on basic telecommunications. Any member of the WTO has the right to define the kind of universal service obligation it wishes to maintain. Such obligations will not be regarded as anti-competitive per se, provided they are administered in a transparent, non-discriminatory and competitively neutral manner and are not more burdensome than necessary for the kind of universal service defined by the member.\n(4) Ensuring universal service (that is to say, the provision of a defined minimum set of services to all end-users at an affordable price) may involve the provision of some services to some end-users at prices that depart from those resulting from normal market conditions. However, compensating undertakings designated to provide such services in such circumstances need not result in any distortion of competition, provided that designated undertakings are compensated for the specific net cost involved and provided that the net cost burden is recovered in a competitively neutral way.\n(5) In a competitive market, certain obligations should apply to all undertakings providing publicly available telephone services at fixed locations and others should apply only to undertakings enjoying significant market power or which have been designated as a universal service operator.\n(6) The network termination point represents a boundary for regulatory purposes between the regulatory framework for electronic communication networks and services and the regulation of telecommunication terminal equipment. Defining the location of the network termination point is the responsibility of the national regulatory authority, where necessary on the basis of a proposal by the relevant undertakings.\n(7) Member States should continue to ensure that the services set out in Chapter II are made available with the quality specified to all end-users in their territory, irrespective of their geographical location, and, in the light of specific national conditions, at an affordable price. Member States may, in the context of universal service obligations and in the light of national conditions, take specific measures for consumers in rural or geographically isolated areas to ensure their access to the services set out in the Chapter II and the affordability of those services, as well as ensure under the same conditions this access, in particular for the elderly, the disabled and for people with special social needs. Such measures may also include measures directly targeted at consumers with special social needs providing support to identified consumers, for example by means of specific measures, taken after the examination of individual requests, such as the paying off of debts.\n(8) A fundamental requirement of universal service is to provide users on request with a connection to the public telephone network at a fixed location, at an affordable price. The requirement is limited to a single narrowband network connection, the provision of which may be restricted by Member States to the end-user's primary location/residence, and does not extend to the Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) which provides two or more connections capable of being used simultaneously. There should be no constraints on the technical means by which the connection is provided, allowing for wired or wireless technologies, nor any constraints on which operators provide part or all of universal service obligations. Connections to the public telephone network at a fixed location should be capable of supporting speech and data communications at rates sufficient for access to online services such as those provided via the public Internet. The speed of Internet access experienced by a given user may depend on a number of factors including the provider(s) of Internet connectivity as well as the given application for which a connection is being used. The data rate that can be supported by a single narrowband connection to the public telephone network depends on the capabilities of the subscriber's terminal equipment as well as the connection. For this reason it is not appropriate to mandate a specific data or bit rate at Community level. Currently available voice band modems typically offer a data rate of 56 kbit/s and employ automatic data rate adaptation to cater for variable line quality, with the result that the achieved data rate may be lower than 56 kbit/s. Flexibility is required on the one hand to allow Member States to take measures where necessary to ensure that connections are capable of supporting such a data rate, and on the other hand to allow Member States where relevant to permit data rates below this upper limit of 56 kbits/s in order, for example, to exploit the capabilities of wireless technologies (including cellular wireless networks) to deliver universal service to a higher proportion of the population. This may be of particular importance in some accession countries where household penetration of traditional telephone connections remains relatively low. In specific cases where the connection to the public telephony network at a fixed location is clearly insufficient to support satisfactory Internet access, Member States should be able to require the connection to be brought up to the level enjoyed by the majority of subscribers so that it supports data rates sufficient for access to the Internet. Where such specific measures produce a net cost burden for those consumers concerned, the net effect may be included in any net cost calculation of universal service obligations.\n(9) The provisions of this Directive do not preclude Member States from designating different undertakings to provide the network and service elements of universal service. Designated undertakings providing network elements may be required to ensure such construction and maintenance as are necessary and proportionate to meet all reasonable requests for connection at a fixed location to the public telephone network and for access to publicly available telephone services at a fixed location.\n(10) Affordable price means a price defined by Member States at national level in the light of specific national conditions, and may involve setting common tariffs irrespective of location or special tariff options to deal with the needs of low-income users. Affordability for individual consumers is related to their ability to monitor and control their expenditure.\n(11) Directory information and a directory enquiry service constitute an essential access tool for publicly available telephone services and form part of the universal service obligation. Users and consumers desire comprehensive directories and a directory enquiry service covering all listed telephone subscribers and their numbers (including fixed and mobile numbers) and want this information to be presented in a non-preferential fashion. Directive 97/66/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 December 1997 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the telecommunications sector(5) ensures the subscribers' right to privacy with regard to the inclusion of their personal information in a public directory.\n(12) For the citizen, it is important for there to be adequate provision of public pay telephones, and for users to be able to call emergency telephone numbers and, in particular, the single European emergency call number (\"112\") free of charge from any telephone, including public pay telephones, without the use of any means of payment. Insufficient information about the existence of \"112\" deprives citizens of the additional safety ensured by the existence of this number at European level especially during their travel in other Member States.\n(13) Member States should take suitable measures in order to guarantee access to and affordability of all publicly available telephone services at a fixed location for disabled users and users with special social needs. Specific measures for disabled users could include, as appropriate, making available accessible public telephones, public text telephones or equivalent measures for deaf or speech-impaired people, providing services such as directory enquiry services or equivalent measures free of charge for blind or partially sighted people, and providing itemised bills in alternative format on request for blind or partially sighted people. Specific measures may also need to be taken to enable disabled users and users with special social needs to access emergency services \"112\" and to give them a similar possibility to choose between different operators or service providers as other consumers. Quality of service standards have been developed for a range of parameters to assess the quality of services received by subscribers and how well undertakings designated with universal service obligations perform in achieving these standards. Quality of service standards do not yet exist in respect of disabled users. Performance standards and relevant parameters should be developed for disabled users and are provided for in Article 11 of this Directive. Moreover, national regulatory authorities should be enabled to require publication of quality of service performance data if and when such standards and parameters are developed. The provider of universal service should not take measures to prevent users from benefiting fully from services offered by different operators or service providers, in combination with its own services offered as part of universal service.\n(14) The importance of access to and use of the public telephone network at a fixed location is such that it should be available to anyone reasonably requesting it. In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, it is for Member States to decide on the basis of objective criteria which undertakings have universal service obligations for the purposes of this Directive, where appropriate taking into account the ability and the willingness of undertakings to accept all or part of the universal service obligations. It is important that universal service obligations are fulfilled in the most efficient fashion so that users generally pay prices that correspond to efficient cost provision. It is likewise important that universal service operators maintain the integrity of the network as well as service continuity and quality. The development of greater competition and choice provide more possibilities for all or part of the universal service obligations to be provided by undertakings other than those with significant market power. Therefore, universal service obligations could in some cases be allocated to operators demonstrating the most cost-effective means of delivering access and services, including by competitive or comparative selection procedures. Corresponding obligations could be included as conditions in authorisations to provide publicly available services.\n(15) Member States should monitor the situation of consumers with respect to their use of publicly available telephone services and in particular with respect to affordability. The affordability of telephone service is related to the information which users receive regarding telephone usage expenses as well as the relative cost of telephone usage compared to other services, and is also related to their ability to control expenditure. Affordability therefore means giving power to consumers through obligations imposed on undertakings designated as having universal service obligations. These obligations include a specified level of itemised billing, the possibility for consumers selectively to block certain calls (such as high-priced calls to premium services), the possibility for consumers to control expenditure via pre-payment means and the possibility for consumers to offset up-front connection fees. Such measures may need to be reviewed and changed in the light of market developments. Current conditions do not warrant a requirement for operators with universal service obligations to alert subscribers where a predetermined limit of expenditure is exceeded or an abnormal calling pattern occurs. Review of the relevant legislative provisions in future should consider whether there is a possible need to alert subscribers for these reasons.\n(16) Except in cases of persistent late payment or non-payment of bills, consumers should be protected from immediate disconnection from the network on the grounds of an unpaid bill and, particularly in the case of disputes over high bills for premium rate services, should continue to have access to essential telephone services pending resolution of the dispute. Member States may decide that such access may continue to be provided only if the subscriber continues to pay line rental charges.\n(17) Quality and price are key factors in a competitive market and national regulatory authorities should be able to monitor achieved quality of service for undertakings which have been designated as having universal service obligations. In relation to the quality of service attained by such undertakings, national regulatory authorities should be able to take appropriate measures where they deem it necessary. National regulatory authorities should also be able to monitor the achieved quality of services of other undertakings providing public telephone networks and/or publicly available telephone services to users at fixed locations.\n(18) Member States should, where necessary, establish mechanisms for financing the net cost of universal service obligations in cases where it is demonstrated that the obligations can only be provided at a loss or at a net cost which falls outside normal commercial standards. It is important to ensure that the net cost of universal service obligations is properly calculated and that any financing is undertaken with minimum distortion to the market and to undertakings, and is compatible with the provisions of Articles 87 and 88 of the Treaty.\n(19) Any calculation of the net cost of universal service should take due account of costs and revenues, as well as the intangible benefits resulting from providing universal service, but should not hinder the general aim of ensuring that pricing structures reflect costs. Any net costs of universal service obligations should be calculated on the basis of transparent procedures.\n(20) Taking into account intangible benefits means that an estimate in monetary terms, of the indirect benefits that an undertaking derives by virtue of its position as provider of universal service, should be deducted from the direct net cost of universal service obligations in order to determine the overall cost burden.\n(21) When a universal service obligation represents an unfair burden on an undertaking, it is appropriate to allow Member States to establish mechanisms for efficiently recovering net costs. Recovery via public funds constitutes one method of recovering the net costs of universal service obligations. It is also reasonable for established net costs to be recovered from all users in a transparent fashion by means of levies on undertakings. Member States should be able to finance the net costs of different elements of universal service through different mechanisms, and/or to finance the net costs of some or all elements from either of the mechanisms or a combination of both. In the case of cost recovery by means of levies on undertakings, Member States should ensure that that the method of allocation amongst them is based on objective and non-discriminatory criteria and is in accordance with the principle of proportionality. This principle does not prevent Member States from exempting new entrants which have not yet achieved any significant market presence. Any funding mechanism should ensure that market participants only contribute to the financing of universal service obligations and not to other activities which are not directly linked to the provision of the universal service obligations. Recovery mechanisms should in all cases respect the principles of Community law, and in particular in the case of sharing mechanisms those of non-discrimination and proportionality. Any funding mechanism should ensure that users in one Member State do not contribute to universal service costs in another Member State, for example when making calls from one Member State to another.\n(22) Where Member States decide to finance the net cost of universal service obligations from public funds, this should be understood to comprise funding from general government budgets including other public financing sources such as state lotteries.\n(23) The net cost of universal service obligations may be shared between all or certain specified classes of undertaking. Member States should ensure that the sharing mechanism respects the principles of transparency, least market distortion, non-discrimination and proportionality. Least market distortion means that contributions should be recovered in a way that as far as possible minimises the impact of the financial burden falling on end-users, for example by spreading contributions as widely as possible.\n(24) National regulatory authorities should satisfy themselves that those undertakings benefiting from universal service funding provide a sufficient level of detail of the specific elements requiring such funding in order to justify their request. Member States' schemes for the costing and financing of universal service obligations should be communicated to the Commission for verification of compatibility with the Treaty. There are incentives for designated operators to raise the assessed net cost of universal service obligations. Therefore Member States should ensure effective transparency and control of amounts charged to finance universal service obligations.\n(25) Communications markets continue to evolve in terms of the services used and the technical means used to deliver them to users. The universal service obligations, which are defined at a Community level, should be periodically reviewed with a view to proposing that the scope be changed or redefined. Such a review should take account of evolving social, commercial and technological conditions and the fact that any change of scope should be subject to the twin test of services that become available to a substantial majority of the population, with a consequent risk of social exclusion for those who can not afford them. Care should be taken in any change of the scope of universal service obligations to ensure that certain technological choices are not artificially promoted above others, that a disproportionate financial burden is not imposed on sector undertakings (thereby endangering market developments and innovation) and that any financing burden does not fall unfairly on consumers with lower incomes. Any change of scope automatically means that any net cost can be financed via the methods permitted in this Directive. Member States are not permitted to impose on market players financial contributions which relate to measures which are not part of universal service obligations. Individual Member States remain free to impose special measures (outside the scope of universal service obligations) and finance them in conformity with Community law but not by means of contributions from market players.\n(26) More effective competition across all access and service markets will give greater choice for users. The extent of effective competition and choice varies across the Community and varies within Member States between geographical areas and between access and service markets. Some users may be entirely dependent on the provision of access and services by an undertaking with significant market power. In general, for reasons of efficiency and to encourage effective competition, it is important that the services provided by an undertaking with significant market power reflect costs. For reasons of efficiency and social reasons, end-user tariffs should reflect demand conditions as well as cost conditions, provided that this does not result in distortions of competition. There is a risk that an undertaking with significant market power may act in various ways to inhibit entry or distort competition, for example by charging excessive prices, setting predatory prices, compulsory bundling of retail services or showing undue preference to certain customers. Therefore, national regulatory authorities should have powers to impose, as a last resort and after due consideration, retail regulation on an undertaking with significant market power. Price cap regulation, geographical averaging or similar instruments, as well as non-regulatory measures such as publicly available comparisons of retail tariffs, may be used to achieve the twin objectives of promoting effective competition whilst pursuing public interest needs, such as maintaining the affordability of publicly available telephone services for some consumers. Access to appropriate cost accounting information is necessary, in order for national regulatory authorities to fulfil their regulatory duties in this area, including the imposition of any tariff controls. However, regulatory controls on retail services should only be imposed where national regulatory authorities consider that relevant wholesale measures or measures regarding carrier selection or pre-selection would fail to achieve the objective of ensuring effective competition and public interest.\n(27) Where a national regulatory authority imposes obligations to implement a cost accounting system in order to support price controls, it may itself undertake an annual audit to ensure compliance with that cost accounting system, provided that it has the necessary qualified staff, or it may require the audit to be carried out by another qualified body, independent of the operator concerned.\n(28) It is considered necessary to ensure the continued application of the existing provisions relating to the minimum set of leased line services in Community telecommunications legislation, in particular in Council Directive 92/44/EEC of 5 June 1992 on the application of open network provision to leased lines(6), until such time as national regulatory authorities determine, in accordance with the market analysis procedures laid down in Directive 2002/21/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on a common regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services (Framework Directive)(7), that such provisions are no longer needed because a sufficiently competitive market has developed in their territory. The degree of competition is likely to vary between different markets of leased lines in the minimum set, and in different parts of the territory. In undertaking the market analysis, national regulatory authorities should make separate assessments for each market of leased lines in the minimum set, taking into account their geographic dimension. Leased lines services constitute mandatory services to be provided without recourse to any compensation mechanisms. The provision of leased lines outside of the minimum set of leased lines should be covered by general retail regulatory provisions rather than specific requirements covering the supply of the minimum set.\n(29) National regulatory authorities may also, in the light of an analysis of the relevant market, require mobile operators with significant market power to enable their subscribers to access the services of any interconnected provider of publicly available telephone services on a call-by-call basis or by means of pre-selection.\n(30) Contracts are an important tool for users and consumers to ensure a minimum level of transparency of information and legal security. Most service providers in a competitive environment will conclude contracts with their customers for reasons of commercial desirability. In addition to the provisions of this Directive, the requirements of existing Community consumer protection legislation relating to contracts, in particular Council Directive 93/13/EEC of 5 April 1993 on unfair terms in consumer contracts(8) and Directive 97/7/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 1997 on the protection of consumers in respect of distance contracts(9), apply to consumer transactions relating to electronic networks and services. Specifically, consumers should enjoy a minimum level of legal certainty in respect of their contractual relations with their direct telephone service provider, such that the contractual terms, conditions, quality of service, condition for termination of the contract and the service, compensation measures and dispute resolution are specified in their contracts. Where service providers other than direct telephone service providers conclude contracts with consumers, the same information should be included in those contracts as well. The measures to ensure transparency on prices, tariffs, terms and conditions will increase the ability of consumers to optimise their choices and thus to benefit fully from competition.\n(31) End-users should have access to publicly available information on communications services. Member States should be able to monitor the quality of services which are offered in their territories. National regulatory authorities should be able systematically to collect information on the quality of services offered in their territories on the basis of criteria which allow comparability between service providers and between Member States. Undertakings providing communications services, operating in a competitive environment, are likely to make adequate and up-to-date information on their services publicly available for reasons of commercial advantage. National regulatory authorities should nonetheless be able to require publication of such information where it is demonstrated that such information is not effectively available to the public.\n(32) End-users should be able to enjoy a guarantee of interoperability in respect of all equipment sold in the Community for the reception of digital television. Member States should be able to require minimum harmonised standards in respect of such equipment. Such standards could be adapted from time to time in the light of technological and market developments.\n(33) It is desirable to enable consumers to achieve the fullest connectivity possible to digital television sets. Interoperability is an evolving concept in dynamic markets. Standards bodies should do their utmost to ensure that appropriate standards evolve along with the technologies concerned. It is likewise important to ensure that connectors are available on television sets that are capable of passing all the necessary elements of a digital signal, including the audio and video streams, conditional access information, service information, application program interface (API) information and copy protection information. This Directive therefore ensures that the functionality of the open interface for digital television sets is not limited by network operators, service providers or equipment manufacturers and continues to evolve in line with technological developments. For display and presentation of digital interactive television services, the realisation of a common standard through a market-driven mechanism is recognised as a consumer benefit. Member States and the Commission may take policy initiatives, consistent with the Treaty, to encourage this development.\n(34) All end-users should continue to enjoy access to operator assistance services whatever organisation provides access to the public telephone network.\n(35) The provision of directory enquiry services and directories is already open to competition. The provisions of this Directive complement the provisions of Directive 97/66/EC by giving subscribers a right to have their personal data included in a printed or electronic directory. All service providers which assign telephone numbers to their subscribers are obliged to make relevant information available in a fair, cost-oriented and non-discriminatory manner.\n(36) It is important that users should be able to call the single European emergency number \"112\", and any other national emergency telephone numbers, free of charge, from any telephone, including public pay telephones, without the use of any means of payment. Member States should have already made the necessary organisational arrangements best suited to the national organisation of the emergency systems, in order to ensure that calls to this number are adequately answered and handled. Caller location information, to be made available to the emergency services, will improve the level of protection and the security of users of \"112\" services and assist the emergency services, to the extent technically feasible, in the discharge of their duties, provided that the transfer of calls and associated data to the emergency services concerned is guaranteed. The reception and use of such information should comply with relevant Community law on the processing of personal data. Steady information technology improvements will progressively support the simultaneous handling of several languages over the networks at a reasonable cost. This in turn will ensure additional safety for European citizens using the \"112\" emergency call number.\n(37) Easy access to international telephone services is vital for European citizens and European businesses. \"00\" has already been established as the standard international telephone access code for the Community. Special arrangements for making calls between adjacent locations across borders between Member States may be established or continued. The ITU has assigned, in accordance with ITU Recommendation E.164, code \"3883\" to the European Telephony Numbering Space (ETNS). In order to ensure connection of calls to the ETNS, undertakings operating public telephone networks should ensure that calls using \"3883\" are directly or indirectly interconnected to ETNS serving networks specified in the relevant European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) standards. Such interconnection arrangements should be governed by the provisions of Directive 2002/19/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on access to, and interconnection of, electronic communications networks and associated facilities (Access Directive)(10).\n(38) Access by end-users to all numbering resources in the Community is a vital pre-condition for a single market. It should include freephone, premium rate, and other non-geographic numbers, except where the called subscriber has chosen, for commercial reasons, to limit access from certain geographical areas. Tariffs charged to parties calling from outside the Member State concerned need not be the same as for those parties calling from inside that Member State.\n(39) Tone dialling and calling line identification facilities are normally available on modern telephone exchanges and can therefore increasingly be provided at little or no expense. Tone dialling is increasingly being used for user interaction with special services and facilities, including value added services, and the absence of this facility can prevent the user from making use of these services. Member States are not required to impose obligations to provide these facilities when they are already available. Directive 97/66/EC safeguards the privacy of users with regard to itemised billing, by giving them the means to protect their right to privacy when calling line identification is implemented. The development of these services on a pan-European basis would benefit consumers and is encouraged by this Directive.\n(40) Number portability is a key facilitator of consumer choice and effective competition in a competitive telecommunications environment such that end-users who so request should be able to retain their number(s) on the public telephone network independently of the organisation providing service. The provision of this facility between connections to the public telephone network at fixed and non-fixed locations is not covered by this Directive. However, Member States may apply provisions for porting numbers between networks providing services at a fixed location and mobile networks.\n(41) The impact of number portability is considerably strengthened when there is transparent tariff information, both for end-users who port their numbers and also for end-users who call those who have ported their numbers. National regulatory authorities should, where feasible, facilitate appropriate tariff transparency as part of the implementation of number portability.\n(42) When ensuring that pricing for interconnection related to the provision of number portability is cost-oriented, national regulatory authorities may also take account of prices available in comparable markets.\n(43) Currently, Member States impose certain \"must carry\" obligations on networks for the distribution of radio or television broadcasts to the public. Member States should be able to lay down proportionate obligations on undertakings under their jurisdiction, in the interest of legitimate public policy considerations, but such obligations should only be imposed where they are necessary to meet general interest objectives clearly defined by Member States in conformity with Community law and should be proportionate, transparent and subject to periodical review. \"Must carry\" obligations imposed by Member States should be reasonable, that is they should be proportionate and transparent in the light of clearly defined general interest objectives, and could, where appropriate, entail a provision for proportionate remuneration. Such \"must carry\" obligations may include the transmission of services specifically designed to enable appropriate access by disabled users.\n(44) Networks used for the distribution of radio or television broadcasts to the public include cable, satellite and terrestrial broadcasting networks. They might also include other networks to the extent that a significant number of end-users use such networks as their principal means to receive radio and television broadcasts.\n(45) Services providing content such as the offer for sale of a package of sound or television broadcasting content are not covered by the common regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services. Providers of such services should not be subject to universal service obligations in respect of these activities. This Directive is without prejudice to measures taken at national level, in compliance with Community law, in respect of such services.\n(46) Where a Member State seeks to ensure the provision of other specific services throughout its national territory, such obligations should be implemented on a cost efficient basis and outside the scope of universal service obligations. Accordingly, Member States may undertake additional measures (such as facilitating the development of infrastructure or services in circumstances where the market does not satisfactorily address the requirements of end-users or consumers), in conformity with Community law. As a reaction to the Commission's e-Europe initiative, the Lisbon European Council of 23 and 24 March 2000 called on Member States to ensure that all schools have access to the Internet and to multimedia resources.\n(47) In the context of a competitive environment, the views of interested parties, including users and consumers, should be taken into account by national regulatory authorities when dealing with issues related to end-users' rights. Effective procedures should be available to deal with disputes between consumers, on the one hand, and undertakings providing publicly available communications services, on the other. Member States should take full account of Commission Recommendation 98/257/EC of 30 March 1998 on the principles applicable to the bodies responsible for out-of-court settlement of consumer disputes(11).\n(48) Co-regulation could be an appropriate way of stimulating enhanced quality standards and improved service performance. Co-regulation should be guided by the same principles as formal regulation, i.e. it should be objective, justified, proportional, non-discriminatory and transparent.\n(49) This Directive should provide for elements of consumer protection, including clear contract terms and dispute resolution, and tariff transparency for consumers. It should also encourage the extension of such benefits to other categories of end-users, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises.\n(50) The provisions of this Directive do not prevent a Member State from taking measures justified on grounds set out in Articles 30 and 46 of the Treaty, and in particular on grounds of public security, public policy and public morality.\n(51) Since the objectives of the proposed action, namely setting a common level of universal service for telecommunications for all European users and of harmonising conditions for access to and use of public telephone networks at a fixed location and related publicly available telephone services and also achieving a harmonised framework for the regulation of electronic communications services, electronic communications networks and associated facilities, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore by reason of the scale or effects of the action be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures in accordance with the principles of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.\n(52) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(12),\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nCHAPTER I\nSCOPE, AIMS AND DEFINITIONS\nArticle 1\nScope and aims\n1. Within the framework of Directive 2002/21/EC (Framework Directive), this Directive concerns the provision of electronic communications networks and services to end-users. The aim is to ensure the availability throughout the Community of good quality publicly available services through effective competition and choice and to deal with circumstances in which the needs of end-users are not satisfactorily met by the market.\n2. This Directive establishes the rights of end-users and the corresponding obligations on undertakings providing publicly available electronic communications networks and services. With regard to ensuring provision of universal service within an environment of open and competitive markets, this Directive defines the minimum set of services of specified quality to which all end-users have access, at an affordable price in the light of specific national conditions, without distorting competition. This Directive also sets out obligations with regard to the provision of certain mandatory services such as the retail provision of leased lines.\nArticle 2\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Directive, the definitions set out in Article 2 of Directive 2002/21/EC (Framework Directive) shall apply.\nThe following definitions shall also apply:\n(a) \"public pay telephone\" means a telephone available to the general public, for the use of which the means of payment may include coins and/or credit/debit cards and/or pre-payment cards, including cards for use with dialling codes;\n(b) \"public telephone network\" means an electronic communications network which is used to provide publicly available telephone services; it supports the transfer between network termination points of speech communications, and also other forms of communication, such as facsimile and data;\n(c) \"publicly available telephone service\" means a service available to the public for originating and receiving national and international calls and access to emergency services through a number or numbers in a national or international telephone numbering plan, and in addition may, where relevant, include one or more of the following services: the provision of operator assistance, directory enquiry services, directories, provision of public pay phones, provision of service under special terms, provision of special facilities for customers with disabilities or with special social needs and/or the provision of non-geographic services;\n(d) \"geographic number\" means a number from the national numbering plan where part of its digit structure contains geographic significance used for routing calls to the physical location of the network termination point (NTP);\n(e) \"network termination point\" (NTP) means the physical point at which a subscriber is provided with access to a public communications network; in the case of networks involving switching or routing, the NTP is identified by means of a specific network address, which may be linked to a subscriber number or name;\n(f) \"non-geographic numbers\" means a number from the national numbering plan that is not a geographic number. It includes inter alia mobile, freephone and premium rate numbers.\nCHAPTER II\nUNIVERSAL SERVICE OBLIGATIONS INCLUDING SOCIAL OBLIGATIONS\nArticle 3\nAvailability of universal service\n1. Member States shall ensure that the services set out in this Chapter are made available at the quality specified to all end-users in their territory, independently of geographical location, and, in the light of specific national conditions, at an affordable price.\n2. Member States shall determine the most efficient and appropriate approach for ensuring the implementation of universal service, whilst respecting the principles of objectivity, transparency, non-discrimination and proportionality. They shall seek to minimise market distortions, in particular the provision of services at prices or subject to other terms and conditions which depart from normal commercial conditions, whilst safeguarding the public interest.\nArticle 4\nProvision of access at a fixed location\n1. Member States shall ensure that all reasonable requests for connection at a fixed location to the public telephone network and for access to publicly available telephone services at a fixed location are met by at least one undertaking.\n2. The connection provided shall be capable of allowing end-users to make and receive local, national and international telephone calls, facsimile communications and data communications, at data rates that are sufficient to permit functional Internet access, taking into account prevailing technologies used by the majority of subscribers and technological feasibility.\nArticle 5\nDirectory enquiry services and directories\n1. Member States shall ensure that:\n(a) at least one comprehensive directory is available to end-users in a form approved by the relevant authority, whether printed or electronic, or both, and is updated on a regular basis, and at least once a year;\n(b) at least one comprehensive telephone directory enquiry service is available to all end-users, including users of public pay telephones.\n2. The directories in paragraph 1 shall comprise, subject to the provisions of Article 11 of Directive 97/66/EC, all subscribers of publicly available telephone services.\n3. Member States shall ensure that the undertaking(s) providing the services referred to in paragraph 1 apply the principle of non-discrimination to the treatment of information that has been provided to them by other undertakings.\nArticle 6\nPublic pay telephones\n1. Member States shall ensure that national regulatory authorities can impose obligations on undertakings in order to ensure that public pay telephones are provided to meet the reasonable needs of end-users in terms of the geographical coverage, the number of telephones, the accessibility of such telephones to disabled users and the quality of services.\n2. A Member State shall ensure that its national regulatory authority can decide not to impose obligations under paragraph 1 in all or part of its territory, if it is satisfied that these facilities or comparable services are widely available, on the basis of a consultation of interested parties as referred to in Article 33.\n3. Member States shall ensure that it is possible to make emergency calls from public pay telephones using the single European emergency call number \"112\" and other national emergency numbers, all free of charge and without having to use any means of payment.\nArticle 7\nSpecial measures for disabled users\n1. Member States shall, where appropriate, take specific measures for disabled end-users in order to ensure access to and affordability of publicly available telephone services, including access to emergency services, directory enquiry services and directories, equivalent to that enjoyed by other end-users.\n2. Member States may take specific measures, in the light of national conditions, to ensure that disabled end-users can also take advantage of the choice of undertakings and service providers available to the majority of end-users.\nArticle 8\nDesignation of undertakings\n1. Member States may designate one or more undertakings to guarantee the provision of universal service as identified in Articles 4, 5, 6 and 7 and, where applicable, Article 9(2) so that the whole of the national territory can be covered. Member States may designate different undertakings or sets of undertakings to provide different elements of universal service and/or to cover different parts of the national territory.\n2. When Member States designate undertakings in part or all of the national territory as having universal service obligations, they shall do so using an efficient, objective, transparent and non-discriminatory designation mechanism, whereby no undertaking is a priori excluded from being designated. Such designation methods shall ensure that universal service is provided in a cost-effective manner and may be used as a means of determining the net cost of the universal service obligation in accordance with Article 12.\nArticle 9\nAffordability of tariffs\n1. National regulatory authorities shall monitor the evolution and level of retail tariffs of the services identified in Articles 4, 5, 6 and 7 as falling under the universal service obligations and provided by designated undertakings, in particular in relation to national consumer prices and income.\n2. Member States may, in the light of national conditions, require that designated undertakings provide tariff options or packages to consumers which depart from those provided under normal commercial conditions, in particular to ensure that those on low incomes or with special social needs are not prevented from accessing or using the publicly available telephone service.\n3. Member States may, besides any provision for designated undertakings to provide special tariff options or to comply with price caps or geographical averaging or other similar schemes, ensure that support is provided to consumers identified as having low incomes or special social needs.\n4. Member States may require undertakings with obligations under Articles 4, 5, 6 and 7 to apply common tariffs, including geographical averaging, throughout the territory, in the light of national conditions or to comply with price caps.\n5. National regulatory authorities shall ensure that, where a designated undertaking has an obligation to provide special tariff options, common tariffs, including geographical averaging, or to comply with price caps, the conditions are fully transparent and are published and applied in accordance with the principle of non-discrimination. National regulatory authorities may require that specific schemes be modified or withdrawn.\nArticle 10\nControl of expenditure\n1. Member States shall ensure that designated undertakings, in providing facilities and services additional to those referred to in Articles 4, 5, 6, 7 and 9(2), establish terms and conditions in such a way that the subscriber is not obliged to pay for facilities or services which are not necessary or not required for the service requested.\n2. Member States shall ensure that designated undertakings with obligations under Articles 4, 5, 6, 7 and 9(2) provide the specific facilities and services set out in Annex I, Part A, in order that subscribers can monitor and control expenditure and avoid unwarranted disconnection of service.\n3. Member States shall ensure that the relevant authority is able to waive the requirements of paragraph 2 in all or part of its national territory if it is satisfied that the facility is widely available.\nArticle 11\nQuality of service of designated undertakings\n1. National regulatory authorities shall ensure that all designated undertakings with obligations under Articles 4, 5, 6, 7 and 9(2) publish adequate and up-to-date information concerning their performance in the provision of universal service, based on the quality of service parameters, definitions and measurement methods set out in Annex III. The published information shall also be supplied to the national regulatory authority.\n2. National regulatory authorities may specify, inter alia, additional quality of service standards, where relevant parameters have been developed, to assess the performance of undertakings in the provision of services to disabled end-users and disabled consumers. National regulatory authorities shall ensure that information concerning the performance of undertakings in relation to these parameters is also published and made available to the national regulatory authority.\n3. National regulatory authorities may, in addition, specify the content, form and manner of information to be published, in order to ensure that end-users and consumers have access to comprehensive, comparable and user-friendly information.\n4. National regulatory authorities shall be able to set performance targets for those undertakings with universal service obligations at least under Article 4. In so doing, national regulatory authorities shall take account of views of interested parties, in particular as referred to in Article 33.\n5. Member States shall ensure that national regulatory authorities are able to monitor compliance with these performance targets by designated undertakings.\n6. Persistent failure by an undertaking to meet performance targets may result in specific measures being taken in accordance with Directive 2002/20/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on the authorisation of electronic communications networks and services (Authorisation Directive)(13). National regulatory authorities shall be able to order independent audits or similar reviews of the performance data, paid for by the undertaking concerned, in order to ensure the accuracy and comparability of the data made available by undertakings with universal service obligations.\nArticle 12\nCosting of universal service obligations\n1. Where national regulatory authorities consider that the provision of universal service as set out in Articles 3 to 10 may represent an unfair burden on undertakings designated to provide universal service, they shall calculate the net costs of its provision.\nFor that purpose, national regulatory authorities shall:\n(a) calculate the net cost of the universal service obligation, taking into account any market benefit which accrues to an undertaking designated to provide universal service, in accordance with Annex IV, Part A; or\n(b) make use of the net costs of providing universal service identified by a designation mechanism in accordance with Article 8(2).\n2. The accounts and/or other information serving as the basis for the calculation of the net cost of universal service obligations under paragraph 1(a) shall be audited or verified by the national regulatory authority or a body independent of the relevant parties and approved by the national regulatory authority. The results of the cost calculation and the conclusions of the audit shall be publicly available.\nArticle 13\nFinancing of universal service obligations\n1. Where, on the basis of the net cost calculation referred to in Article 12, national regulatory authorities find that an undertaking is subject to an unfair burden, Member States shall, upon request from a designated undertaking, decide:\n(a) to introduce a mechanism to compensate that undertaking for the determined net costs under transparent conditions from public funds; and/or\n(b) to share the net cost of universal service obligations between providers of electronic communications networks and services.\n2. Where the net cost is shared under paragraph 1(b), Member States shall establish a sharing mechanism administered by the national regulatory authority or a body independent from the beneficiaries under the supervision of the national regulatory authority. Only the net cost, as determined in accordance with Article 12, of the obligations laid down in Articles 3 to 10 may be financed.\n3. A sharing mechanism shall respect the principles of transparency, least market distortion, non-discrimination and proportionality, in accordance with the principles of Annex IV, Part B. Member States may choose not to require contributions from undertakings whose national turnover is less than a set limit.\n4. Any charges related to the sharing of the cost of universal service obligations shall be unbundled and identified separately for each undertaking. Such charges shall not be imposed or collected from undertakings that are not providing services in the territory of the Member State that has established the sharing mechanism.\nArticle 14\nTransparency\n1. Where a mechanism for sharing the net cost of universal service obligations as referred to in Article 13 is established, national regulatory authorities shall ensure that the principles for cost sharing, and details of the mechanism used, are publicly available.\n2. Subject to Community and national rules on business confidentiality, national regulatory authorities shall ensure that an annual report is published giving the calculated cost of universal service obligations, identifying the contributions made by all the undertakings involved, and identifying any market benefits, that may have accrued to the undertaking(s) designated to provide universal service, where a fund is actually in place and working.\nArticle 15\nReview of the scope of universal service\n1. The Commission shall periodically review the scope of universal service, in particular with a view to proposing to the European Parliament and the Council that the scope be changed or redefined. A review shall be carried out, on the first occasion within two years after the date of application referred to in Article 38(1), second subparagraph, and subsequently every three years.\n2. This review shall be undertaken in the light of social, economic and technological developments, taking into account, inter alia, mobility and data rates in the light of the prevailing technologies used by the majority of subscribers. The review process shall be undertaken in accordance with Annex V. The Commission shall submit a report to the European Parliament and the Council regarding the outcome of the review.\nCHAPTER III\nREGULATORY CONTROLS ON UNDERTAKINGS WITH SIGNIFICANT MARKET POWER IN SPECIFIC MARKETS\nArticle 16\nReview of obligations\n1.

The Commission shall indicate relevant markets for the obligations relating to retail markets in the initial recommendation on relevant product and service markets and the Decision identifying transnational markets to be adopted in accordance with Article 15 of Directive 2002/21/EC (Framework Directive).\n3. Member States shall ensure that, as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Directive, and periodically thereafter, national regulatory authorities undertake a market analysis, in accordance with the procedure set out in Article 16 of Directive 2002/21/EC (Framework Directive) to determine whether to maintain, amend or withdraw the obligations relating to retail markets. Measures taken shall be subject to the procedure referred to in Article 7 of Directive 2002/21/EC (Framework Directive).\nArticle 17\nRegulatory controls on retail services\n1. Member States shall ensure that, where:\n(a) as a result of a market analysis carried out in accordance with Article 16(3) a national regulatory authority determines that a given retail market identified in accordance with Article 15 of Directive 2002/21/EC (Framework Directive) is not effectively competitive, and\n(b) the national regulatory authority concludes that obligations imposed under Directive 2002/19/EC (Access Directive), or Article 19 of this Directive would not result in the achievement of the objectives set out in Article 8 of Directive 2002/21/EC (Framework Directive),\nnational regulatory authorities shall impose appropriate regulatory obligations on undertakings identified as having significant market power on a given retail market in accordance with Article 14 of Directive 2002/21/EC (Framework Directive).\n2. Obligations imposed under paragraph 1 shall be based on the nature of the problem identified and be proportionate and justified in the light of the objectives laid down in Article 8 of Directive 2002/21/EC (Framework Directive). The obligations imposed may include requirements that the identified undertakings do not charge excessive prices, inhibit market entry or restrict competition by setting predatory prices, show undue preference to specific end-users or unreasonably bundle services. National regulatory authorities may apply to such undertakings appropriate retail price cap measures, measures to control individual tariffs, or measures to orient tariffs towards costs or prices on comparable markets, in order to protect end-user interests whilst promoting effective competition.\n3. National regulatory authorities shall, on request, submit information to the Commission concerning the retail controls applied and, where appropriate, the cost accounting systems used by the undertakings concerned.\n4. National regulatory authorities shall ensure that, where an undertaking is subject to retail tariff regulation or other relevant retail controls, the necessary and appropriate cost accounting systems are implemented. National regulatory authorities may specify the format and accounting methodology to be used. Compliance with the cost accounting system shall be verified by a qualified independent body. National regulatory authorities shall ensure that a statement concerning compliance is published annually.\n5. Without prejudice to Article 9(2) and Article 10, national regulatory authorities shall not apply retail control mechanisms under paragraph 1 of this Article to geographical or user markets where they are satisfied that there is effective competition.\nArticle 18\nRegulatory controls on the minimum set of leased lines\n1. Where, as a result of the market analysis carried out in accordance with Article 16(3), a national regulatory authority determines that the market for the provision of part or all of the minimum set of leased lines is not effectively competitive, it shall identify undertakings with significant market power in the provision of those specific elements of the minimum set of leased lines services in all or part of its territory in accordance with Article 14 of Directive 2002/21/EC (Framework Directive). The national regulatory authority shall impose obligations regarding the provision of the minimum set of leased lines, as identified in the list of standards published in the Official Journal of the European Communities in accordance with Article 17 of Directive 2002/21/EC (Framework Directive), and the conditions for such provision set out in Annex VII to this Directive, on such undertakings in relation to those specific leased line markets.\n2. Where as a result of the market analysis carried out in accordance with Article 16(3), a national regulatory authority determines that a relevant market for the provision of leased lines in the minimum set is effectively competitive, it shall withdraw the obligations referred to in paragraph 1 in relation to this specific leased line market.\n3. The minimum set of leased lines with harmonised characteristics, and associated standards, shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities as part of the list of standards referred to in Article 17 of Directive 2002/21/EC (Framework Directive). The Commission may adopt amendments necessary to adapt the minimum set of leased lines to new technical developments and to changes in market demand, including the possible deletion of certain types of leased line from the minimum set, acting in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 37(2) of this Directive.\nArticle 19\nCarrier selection and carrier pre-selection\n1. National regulatory authorities shall require undertakings notified as having significant market power for the provision of connection to and use of the public telephone network at a fixed location in accordance with Article 16(3) to enable their subscribers to access the services of any interconnected provider of publicly available telephone services:\n(a) on a call-by-call basis by dialling a carrier selection code; and\n(b) by means of pre-selection, with a facility to override any pre-selected choice on a call-by-call basis by dialling a carrier selection code.\n2. User requirements for these facilities to be implemented on other networks or in other ways shall be assessed in accordance with the market analysis procedure laid down in Article 16 of Directive 2002/21/EC (Framework Directive) and implemented in accordance with Article 12 of Directive 2002/19/EC (Access Directive).\n3. National regulatory authorities shall ensure that pricing for access and interconnection related to the provision of the facilities in paragraph 1 is cost oriented and that direct charges to subscribers, if any, do not act as a disincentive for the use of these facilities.\nCHAPTER IV\nEND-USER INTERESTS AND RIGHTS\nArticle 20\nContracts\n1.

PROVISIONAL MEASURES\n(1) The Commission, by Regulation (EC) No 367/2001(2) (the \"provisional Regulation\") imposed a provisional anti-dumping duty on imports of polyethylene terephthalate (\"PET\") film falling within ex CN code 3920 62 19 and ex CN code 3920 62 90 and originating in India and the Republic of Korea (\"Korea\").\n(2) It is recalled that the investigation period of dumping and injury covered the period from 1 April 1999 to 31 March 2000 (\"IP\"). The examination of trends relevant for the injury analysis covered the period from 1 January 1996 to 31 March 2000 (\"period under consideration\").\nB. SUBSEQUENT PROCEDURE\n(3) Following the imposition of provisional measures on imports of PET film originating in India and Korea, several interested parties submitted comments in writing. The parties who so requested were also granted an opportunity to be heard orally.\n(4) The Commission continued to seek and verify all information it deemed necessary for its definitive findings.\n(5) Additional verification visits were carried out at the premises of the following users:\n- Emtec Magnetics GmbH, Ludwigshafen, Germany\n- Rogers Induflex NV LEX NV, Gent, Belgium\n- Leonhard Kurz GmbH & Co., Fürth, Germany\n- Eurofoil, Blaenavon, U.K.\n(6) All parties were informed of the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which it was intended to recommend the imposition of definitive anti-dumping duties and the definitive collection of amounts secured by way of provisional duties. They were also granted a period within which they could make representations subsequent to this disclosure.\n(7) The oral and written comments submitted by the parties were considered, and, where appropriate, the provisional findings have been modified accordingly.\nC. PRODUCT CONCERNED AND LIKE PRODUCT\n1. Product concerned\n(a) Arguments of the parties\n(8) Some exporting producers re-iterated the argument that metallised PET film should be excluded from the product scope of the current proceeding on the grounds that metallised PET film cannot be considered alike to base PET film since it had different basic physical and technical characteristics, required different production equipment and processes, being consequently more expensive to produce and thus sold at a higher price. These parties also argued that the use of metallised PET film is different from that of base PET film and is also classifiable under CN codes other than CN codes ex 3920 62 19 and 3920 62 90, namely within CN code 3921.\n(b) Findings of the investigation\n(9) The investigation showed that the metallisation process consisting of the addition of metal, such as aluminium, by a vapour deposition process, does not alter the basic physical, technical and chemical characteristics of PET film. Moreover, base and metallised PET film are in many applications interchangeable and may have the same, or similar, uses. Therefore the provisional findings set out in recital 19 of the provisional Regulation, namely that metallised PET film and base PET film constitute one single product and are classifiable under the CN codes covered by the proceeding, i.e. ex 3920 62 19 and 3920 62 90, are confirmed.\n(10) It should be noted that the fact that an additional production step is required for the production of metallised PET film, with resulting higher cost of production and sales price, is not an element which could justify per se the exclusion of a certain type of PET film from the product scope of the proceeding.\n(11) Finally, the investigation showed that metallised PET film has to be distinguished from film, which is reinforced, laminated, supported or similarly combined with other materials. These processes modify the basic physical, chemical and technical characteristics of PET film to such an extent that the resulting product cannot be considered to be the product concerned. In addition, it should be noted that only when PET film is combined with other materials in such a way, is the final product classifiable under CN code 3921.\n(12) In the absence of further comments other than those mentioned above, the product description as set out in recitals 9 to 22 of the provisional Regulation is confirmed.\n2. Like product\n(13) In the absence of any comments, the definition of the like product as described in recital 23 of the provisional Regulation is confirmed.\nD. DUMPING\n1. General methodology\n(a) Normal value, export price and comparison\n(14) In the absence of any comments under these headings, the provisional findings as set out in recitals 28 to 34 of the provisional Regulation are confirmed.\n(b) Dumping margins\n(15) The general methodology for establishing the dumping margins for the companies investigated, as described in recital 35 of the provisional Regulation, is confirmed.\n(16) The general methodology for establishing the dumping margins for the cooperating companies not included in the sample, as described in recital 36 of the provisional Regulation, is confirmed. When the dumping margin for the cooperating companies not included in the sample was established, any zero and de minimis margins were disregarded.\n(17) The general methodology for establishing the dumping margins for those exporting producers, which neither replied to the questionnaire nor otherwise made themselves known, as described in recitals 37 and 38 of the provisional Regulation, is confirmed. However, in the case of Korea, as only one out of the three sampled exporting producers was found to have practised dumping, the residual dumping margin was set at the weighted average dumping margin of a representative number of models with the highest dumping margins exported by that exporting producer.\n(18) It should be noted that in cases where an exporting producer exported more than one product type to the Community, the weighted average overall dumping margin was determined by computing the dumping found on each type without zeroing \"negative dumping\" found on individual types.\n2. India\n(a) Normal value and export price\n(19) In the absence of further comments, the findings of recitals 39 to 42 of the provisional Regulation are confirmed.\n(b) Comparison\n(i) Level of trade\n(20) One Indian exporting producer reiterated its claim for an adjustment for differences in the level of trade between sales of the product concerned to traders on the domestic and export markets (recital 47 of the provisional Regulation).\n(21) It was also submitted, following disclosure of the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which provisional measures were adopted, that two levels of trade (end-users and traders) existed in both (domestic and export) markets and that a selective comparison should be made: that is, export prices to traders should be compared with normal values based on sales to traders and export prices to end-users compared with normal values based on sales to end-users.\n(22) However, the information submitted in the questionnaire reply and subsequently verified already indicated that there were no consistent and distinct differences in functions and prices for the different levels of trade for comparable models when sold in the domestic market of the exporting country. Consequently the findings set out in recitals 46 and 47 of the provisional Regulation are confirmed and the claim for a selective comparison is rejected.\n(ii) Other allowances\n(23) The Indian exporting producers claimed that the adjustment requested pursuant to Article 2(10)(k) \"other factors\" and/or Article 2(10)(b) \"Import charges and indirect taxes\" (depending on the exporter) of the basic Regulation on the export price for the benefits received under the Duty Entitlement Passbook (\"DEPB\") scheme on a post-export basis should have been granted. They claimed that the income received from the DEPB resulted in a lower export price and that therefore, the Commission should have added this income to the export price to ensure a fair comparison with the normal value, as domestic sales do not benefit from such income. Moreover, the Indian exporters claimed that the deduction, in accordance with Article 14(1) of the basic Regulation, of the export subsidies accounted for by the existing countervailing duty from the anti-dumping duty was legally not justified as the countervailing duties were determined on the basis of a different investigation period.\n(24) Article 2(10) of the basic Regulation contemplates only the possibility of adjustments that affect price comparability. In the questionnaire replies and during the on-spot verifications, the DEPB benefit was always accounted for as \"other income\" and not as a \"negative cost\" attributed to the cost of raw materials of the exported goods. Therefore, already on the basis of the company's accounting records, there is no explicit link between pricing of the exported goods and the DEPB income received.\n(25) The provision of Article 14(1) of the basic Regulation which reflects Article VI of the GATT Agreement shows that such subsidisation can, albeit indirectly, be addressed in an anti-dumping investigation and any regulation imposing an anti-dumping duty provided that the product is not subject to both anti-dumping and countervailing duties for the purpose of dealing with one and the same situation arising from dumping or from export subsidisation. The rationale behind Article 14(1) of the basic Regulation is indeed to avoid any duplication of duties intended to counteract the same situation arising from dumping or export subsidisation, and therefore, countervailing duties resulting from export subsidies have to be deducted regardless of the investigation period on the basis of which they were determined. It is noted, as explained under recitals 78 and 79 below, that an adjustment under Article 14(1) of the basic Regulation has been made. For all these reasons, the above request had to be rejected.\n(c) Dumping margin\n(26) In the absence of any comments or new information, the methodology set out in recitals 51 to 53 of the provisional Regulation is confirmed.\n(27)\nTABLE\n3. Korea\n(a) Normal value\n(28) Two Korean cooperating exporting producers argued that so-called local export sales (i.e. domestic sales foreseen for the export market after further processing and/or packaging) had been excluded from the calculation of normal value with no legal basis for doing so. However, it is evident that Korean authorities permit such sales to be made without the addition of any local sales tax (VAT); the vendor is also able to transfer to the purchaser the right to claim duty drawback and the sales are usually made in a foreign currency. It is therefore evident from the way that such sales are structured in Korea that they are made for export and do not permit a proper comparison. Thus the approach followed for provisional determinations is maintained.\n(29) In view of the above, the findings as described in recital 57 of the provisional Regulation are confirmed.\n(b) Export price\n(30) Two of the exporting producers had related importers in the Community and both indicated that they considered that the profit margin allocated to those importers (5,5 %) was unreasonably high given that the functions performed by the importers was limited to the re-invoicing of sales, without playing an active role in the sale itself. It was suggested that these related importers did not generate profit per se, but merely received commission on sales made. Nonetheless, the commission rate indicated cannot be taken as necessarily being accurate as the parties are related. The fact that the related importers may be remunerated on a fixed commission basis does not necessarily bear any relation to the functions performed by those importers. Furthermore, neither of the claimants submitted any specific data which indicated that the margin used was not in line with prevailing market conditions.\n(31) In view of the above, the provisional findings as described in recital 58 of the provisional Regulation are confirmed.\n(c) Comparison\n(i) Exchange rates fluctuation\n(32) Following a request by the Korean exporting producers the adjustment for a sustained movement in exchange rates was re-examined. Following this re-examination, the average exchange rate was that of two months before the actual invoice date.\n(ii) Duty drawback\n(33) All of the Korean cooperating exporting producers considered that the methodology used in allocating duty drawback to domestic sales was unreasonable, in particular because the raw materials concerned are used for manufacturing products other than PET film. The Commission therefore reconsidered the issue and decided to adopt a revised two-step approach.\n(34) Firstly, the quantities of raw materials purchased and used solely for PET film production, (whether intended for domestic or export sales) were calculated using the nationally approved coefficients and expressed as percentages of the totals of raw materials purchased. These percentages were then applied to each of the individual supplies of raw materials. Thus each raw material was allocated to both domestic and export sales in which the raw material was used, (both product concerned and other products), in the appropriate proportion. The allocation started with supplies carrying the lowest duty rates, as explained in the provisional Regulation. The result led to increased amounts of duty drawback allowable for two exporting producers.\nWith the above exceptions concerning duty drawback and exchange rate conversion, the provisional findings as described in recitals 59 to 65 of the provisional Regulation are confirmed.\n(d) Dumping margin\n(35) The findings of recitals 66 and 67 of the provisional Regulation are confirmed with the exception of one cooperating exporting producer who objected to the use of the comparison of a weighted-average normal value to individual export transactions to determine its dumping margin on the basis that the mere variation of export prices by customer, region or time period does not justify the use of the weighted average to transaction method for the determination of the dumping margin. The issue was re-examined and it was found that there was a pattern of export prices which differs among customers, the effect of which on the degree of dumping being practised by the exporter was not significant. The methodology for establishing the dumping margins for the companies investigated as described in recitals 66 and 67 of the provisional Regulation was therefore revised in respect of this exporting producer from a weighted average to transaction approach to a weighted average to weighted average approach.\n(36)\nTABLE\nE. COMMUNITY INDUSTRY\n(37) Certain Indian exporting producers argued that the definition of the Community industry and, consequently, the injury analysis, should not have been limited to the three cooperating complainant Community producers, but should have been extended to all the Community producers, including Fapack, which participated in lodging the complaint but only provided some basic information, and three other Community producers, which are not complainants and are not related to any exporting producers and which, as well, only submitted some basic information.\n(38) It is confirmed that, as mentioned in recital 73 of the provisional Regulation, all these seven operators are indeed Community producers and thus constitute the Community production within the meaning of Article 4(1) of the basic Regulation. However, as described in recital 70 of the provisional Regulation, the latter four Community producers only submitted some basic information but did not reply fully to the questionnaire intended for Community producers. Therefore, this information could not be used for the purposes of the assessment of the situation of the Community industry. These Community producers were accordingly not included in the definition of the Community industry. The argument had therefore to be rejected.\n(39) One interested party contested the finding that the Community industry accounted for more than 70 % of the total Community production of PET film. This element has been re-examined by the Commission, and a clerical error was found. The Community industry actually accounts for 60 % of the total Community production.\n(40) Certain interested parties claimed that if indeed metallised PET film remains included in the definition of the product concerned, certain producers of metallised PET film should also be regarded as Community producers forming part of the Community industry.\n(41) The investigation showed that the companies in question do not produce base PET film, but in fact purchase base PET film from different sources and then perform the additional metallisation process. This additional processing step undertaken by them is however not in itself sufficient to justify considering them as Community producers of PET film. Indeed, they are simply processors of a product without changing its basic physical, technical and chemical characteristics\nF. INJURY\n1. Community consumption\n(42) In the absence of any new information, the provisional findings concerning the Community consumption as described in recitals 76 to 79 of the provisional Regulation are confirmed.\n2. Imports concerned\n(a) Preliminary remark\n(43) Certain exporting producers raised the argument that the imports attributable to exporting producers found not to have dumped should be excluded for the analysis of the injury aspect. However, even if such imports were to be excluded from the analysis, the conclusions as to the existence of material injury caused by dumped imports would remain unchanged. Indeed, the price undercutting would remain significant, as well as the increase in volume and market shares and the remaining imports found to be dumped would still represent more than 13 % of the Community market. The decrease observed in the sales prices would also remain significant.\n(b) Cumulative assessment of the effects of the imports concerned\n(44) Certain Indian exporting producers argued that imports of PET film originating in India should not be cumulated with those originating in Korea in view of the differences existing in the conditions of competition. The claim was based on the grounds that the import volume, the market shares and prices developed differently during the period 1997 to IP.\n(45) As regards the conditions of competition between Korean and Indian imports, when taking into account the totality of the period under consideration, i.e. between 1996 and the IP, and not, as suggested, the period 1997 to the IP, the volume of imports, market shares and import prices in fact developed in a similar way. It is also confirmed that import volumes from both countries were substantial during the investigation period. Moreover, significant price undercutting was found for both imports originating in India and Korea, which were sold via the same sales channels and with similar commercial conditions. The argument has therefore to be rejected. Given the above, the findings of recital 85 of the provisional Regulation, setting out that that imports originating the countries concerned should be assessed cumulatively, are hereby confirmed.\n(c) Volume, market shares and prices of the imports concerned\n(46) In the absence of any new information as regards the volume and prices of imports from the countries concerned, the provisional findings are confirmed.\n(d) Price undercutting\n(47) As regards the price undercutting margins, certain Indian exporting producers questioned the fact that the Commission services did not consider, in the calculation of the weighted average export prices, the countervailing duties imposed on imports of PET film originating in India in 1999. They also reiterated their request for a level of trade adjustment, since Indian exporters mostly sell to wholesalers while the Community industry nearly always sells directly to users of PET film.\n(48) The calculations of price undercutting margins were revised by adding to the export prices the countervailing duties, where applicable. As regards the level of trade adjustment, the further analysis confirmed firstly, that, as described in recital 93 of the provisional Regulation, the selling price to wholesalers or to users does not depend on the type of customer but rather on the purchased volumes, and secondly, that the two levels of trade are not clearly separated and that there is no clear price difference between them. Moreover, it is confirmed that the Community industry also sells the product concerned to distributors and wholesalers and not only to users, contrary to what was claimed by some interested parties. Several companies were indeed found to be supplied by both exporting producers from the countries concerned and the Community industry.\n(49) Before the above background, price undercutting margins were reviewed on the basis of the evidence submitted by interested parties and amended where appropriate. The revised weighted average price undercutting margins found per country, expressed as a percentage of the Community industry prices, are as follows:\n- Korea: from 14,9 % to 36,8 %, on weighted average 20,6 %\n- India: from 34,5 % to 44,8 %, on weighted average by 37,5 %.\n3. Situation of the Community industry\n(50) Several interested parties questioned the conclusion reached in the provisional Regulation that the Community industry suffered material injury on the grounds that some factors have developed positively between 1996 and the IP (i.e. production capacity, production, sales volume, productivity, stocks and wages).\n(51) In this respect, it should be noted that not all the factors enumerated in Article 3(5) of the basic Regulation have to indicate a negative development in order to conclude that the Community industry is suffering material injury. In the current case, the Community industry lost market shares and, due to the price depressing effect of imports from the countries concerned, it had to significantly lower its sales prices, leading to a severe deterioration of its financial situation.\n(52) A Korean exporting producer questioned that the Community industry suffered material injury on the grounds that it is viable and competitive, as set in recital 159 of the provisional Regulation and that it still held an important position on the Community market during the IP.\n(53) The fact that the Community industry is viable and competitive does not preclude the finding of material injury. Indeed, the finding, that the Community industry is viable and competitive had been made in the context of the Community interest analysis which, inter alia, examined the effect of taking or not-taking anti-dumping measures on the various operators in the Community. All this does not invalidate the conclusion that the Community industry suffered material injury as evidenced by a number of factors including the significant loss of market share during the period under consideration. The argument has therefore to be rejected.\n(54) A Korean exporting producer alleged that the increase of the production capacity by the Community industry, that took place between 1998 and 1999, is in contradiction with the fact that its investments remained limited during the same period. It should be noted in that respect that investments related to the production capacity increase took place during the years 1997 and 1998, as set out in recital 108 of the provisional Regulation. As however the new capacity installed was only operational in 1998 and 1999, the increase in production capacity and the investments did not take place in the same period.\n(55) Certain Indian exporters claimed that limiting the analysis of the Community industry's sales to the domestic sales, in terms of volumes and prices, does not comply with the provision of Article 3(4) of the WTO Anti-dumping Agreements on the grounds that the Agreement refers to total sales, thus including exports.\n(56) In this respect, it should be noted that the injury assessment was undertaken in line with the relevant provisions of the basic Regulation and consistent practice of the Community institutions. In addition, it should be noted that Article 3(4), in conjunction with Article 3(1) and (2), of the WTO Anti-dumping Agreement, clearly refers to the evaluation of the impact of dumped imports on prices in the domestic market and on the situation of the domestic industry. It also follows from the purpose of this type of investigation where, inter alia, the effect of dumped imports from one or more countries into the Community are at issue (and not the effect of dumped imports into third country markets) that injury of the Community industry must be found to exist on the domestic market only and that the situation with respect to exports or on export markets is therefore irrelevant in the context of the injury assessment. The argument has therefore to be rejected. However, and in line with consistent practice, the Community industry's export performance has been examined in the context of the question of causal link between the dumped imports and the injurious situation, as set in recital 144 of the provisional Regulation.\n(57) On the basis of the above, the provisional findings as regards the material injury suffered by the Community industry during the IP are confirmed.\nG. CAUSATION\n(58) Some interested parties claimed that the assessment of the causal link was flawed since the deterioration of certain injury factors, i.e. profitability, cash flow, return on investments and ability to raise capital, should be considered as being linked to autonomous cyclical developments and to the massive investments made by the Community industry during the period considered rather than to the impact of the imports concerned.\n(59) Firstly, there is no indication that the Community industry suffers from a cyclical downturn. Secondly, the further analysis of the financial situation of the Community industry confirmed that its deterioration was mainly due to the decrease of its unit sales prices. Moreover, since during the whole period under consideration the unit cost of production decreased, the deterioration cannot be attributed to higher cost of production related to the new investments.\n(60) In the light of the above and in the absence of any new information, the provisional findings as described in recitals 119 to 123 of the provisional Regulation are confirmed.\nH. COMMUNITY INTEREST\n1. Unrelated importers and traders\n(61) One unrelated importer argued that, contrary to what was set out in recital 188 of the provisional Regulation, the imposition of countervailing duties reduced the availability of Indian PET film on the Community market and that the level of the anti-dumping duties as set out in this Regulation will make it unable to source PET film from its traditional Indian suppliers. It further argued that the PET film produced by the Community industry outside the Community is imported by the Community industry itself, and that, due to this relationship, this would eliminate any other real alternative sources of supply.\n(62) In this respect, Eurostat data showed that between the year 1999 (the provisional countervailing duties were imposed in August 1999) and the year 2000, imports from India increased by 11 %. As to the level of the anti-dumping duties proposed, it cannot be excluded that they will result in an increase of the import prices. However, given the different levels of measures proposed, it can be expected at the same time that some of the exporting producers concerned will continue to sell on the Community market, albeit at non-dumped prices. Regarding the existence of alternative sources of supply, it appears that, during the year 1999, the Community industry's purchases of PET film originating in the US and Japan, the two major exporting countries which are not the countries concerned by this proceeding, represented around 35 % of the total imports from these countries. It is therefore confirmed that other alternative sources of supply are available.\n2. Users of PET film in the Community\n(63) It should be noted that out of the 23 users that cooperated at the provisional stage of the proceeding, and purchasing slightly over 40 % of the total imports from the countries concerned, only one expressed its concerns after the imposition of the provisional duties. This low degree of reactions might suggest that the measures would not have such an important impact on the users concerned.\n(64) Four other users, which made themselves known after the imposition of the provisional measures, argued that the imposition of duties could limit their choice of suppliers and possibly create a shortage of PET film in the Community market. Those users also claimed that a price increase of PET film has occurred in the Community market since provisional duties were imposed, with a negative effect on their competitiveness on the world market.\n(65) It should be recalled in this respect that, as found at the provisional stage, investigated users purchased on average around 58 % of their PET film consumption from the Community industry, around 28 % from the countries concerned and around 14 % in other third countries. Furthermore, a significant number of actors will remain active on the Community market, i.e. the Community industry and other Community producers, an economic operator in the Community, at least some of exporting producers in the countries concerned and in other third countries. Therefore, even if it cannot be excluded that some exporting producers in the countries concerned will decrease their level of exports to the Community further to the anti-dumping measures imposed, it is unlikely that a shortage on the Community market will occur. On the other hand, should measures not be imposed, the possible disappearance of the Community industry's manufacturing activities for PET film would, as set out in recital 185 of the provisional Regulation, create severe supply constraints.\n(66) As to the level of prices, it should be noted that users have until recently benefited from artificially low prices due to unfair trade practices. Sales prices in the Community market decreased by an average of 40 % between 1996 and the IP. Even if a price increase for PET film in the Community cannot be excluded, it is expected that it will be moderate. This is reinforced in particular by the level of duties imposed for certain exporting producers concerned and the presence of a certain number of actors, which will compete with each other on the Community market.\n(67) Moreover, the further analysis and verification visits to users confirmed that PET film, as raw material for different finished products, is frequently not a significant cost item, that products incorporating PET film only account for a small proportion of their total production and, finally, that users also source their products in the Community and other third countries not concerned by the proceeding. It can however not be excluded that, for certain users for which PET film represents a crucial raw material, the anti-dumping duties will have an important impact on the total cost of production. Nevertheless, this does not alter the average overall results of the investigation. The finding of recital 183 of the provisional Regulation that the imposition of duties will probably not have, on average, a significant impact on the users of PET film, is therefore confirmed.\n3. Conclusion on the Community interest\n(68) In the absence of any new information regarding the Community interest, the findings as described in recitals 156 to 191 of the provisional Regulation are confirmed.\nI. DEFINITIVE ANTI-DUMPING MEASURES\n1. Injury elimination level\n(69) Based on the methodology explained in recitals 193 to 195 of the provisional Regulation, and taking into account the arguments and modifications mentioned above in relation to price undercutting calculations, an injury elimination level has been established for the purposes of establishing the level of measures to be definitively imposed. However, regarding the non consideration of the countervailing duties, it should be noted that, as explained in recital 198 of the provisional Regulation, export subsidies are deducted from the proposed anti-dumping duties pursuant to Article 14(1) of the basic Regulation after having applied the lesser duty rule, and there is accordingly no need to consider them at the level of the injury margin calculation.\n(70) Certain Indian exporting producers argued that the injury margins have been incorrectly calculated. It has been claimed that the injury margin should be expressed as a percentage of the total cif turnover and not be limited to the cif turnover of the comparable models. They based their arguments on the conclusions of the WTO Appellate body in the bed linen case(3).\n(71) Firstly, it should be noted that these conclusions have been drawn in the context of dumping calculations and are not relevant in the context of injury calculations. Secondly, it is consistent practice to express the injury amount as a percentage of the cif turnover of those models which were used in order to establish the said injury amount. The approach proposed by the Indian exporting producers in question would in fact result in the use of figures which are not comparable. For all these reasons, the claim had to be rejected.\n(72) The Community industry submitted that a profit margin of 13 % on turnover would be more appropriate than the 6 % profit margin that was used for the provisional injury margin calculation. It argued that a company's own capital resources should at least earn a return on net assets which equals bank loan rates. It was further claimed that this level of profit was reached in 1996, when conditions of fair competition prevailed.\n(73) In this respect, it should be noted that the profit margin that is to be used for the determination of the non injurious price should be understood as the profitability level that could reasonably be reached in the absence of injurious dumping. However, it is not important in this case to define a conclusive percentage given that the injury margins are already on the basis of a 6 % profit margin higher than the dumping margins. The argument has therefore no practical impact.\n(74) Given the above, and in the absence of new evidence, the methodology used for establishing the injury elimination level as described in recitals 193 to 195 of the provisional Regulation is confirmed.\n2. Form and level of the duties\n(75) The investigation showed that the imports of the product have also taken place under CN codes other than those covered by this proceeding, i.e. CN codes ex 3920 62 19 and 3920 62 90. The attention of the customs authorities is accordingly drawn to this misclassification.\n(76) In the light of the foregoing and in accordance with Article 9(4) of the basic Regulation, a definitive anti-dumping duty should be imposed at the level of the dumping margins found, since they were in all cases lower than the injury margins.\n(77) As regards the residual duty to be applied to the non cooperating exporting producers of the respective countries, as the level of cooperation was considered significant in both countries, for India the residual duty should be fixed on the basis of the highest duty rate established for the sampled cooperating producers. For Korea, as only one of the three sampled exporting producers was found to have practised dumping the residual duty should be set, in application of the lesser duty rule, at the weighted average dumping margin of a representative number of models with the highest dumping margins exported by that exporting producer.\n(78) As recalled in recitals 50 and 198 of the provisional Regulation, Article 14(1) of the basic Regulation makes it mandatory that no product be subject to both anti-dumping and countervailing duties for the purpose of dealing with the same situation arising from dumping or export subsidisation. In this context, the fact that the countervailing duties were established on a different IP and that the amount of export subsidy in the anti-subsidy IP and the anti-dumping IP are different, is irrelevant. The rationale behind Article 14(1) of the basic Regulation is indeed to avoid any duplication of duties intended to counteract the same situation arising from dumping or export subsidisation, and therefore, countervailing duties resulting from export subsidies have to be deducted regardless of the investigation period on the basis of which they were determined. It is also noted that no request for a review of the countervailing measures has been received. Therefore, the provisional findings as described in recitals 50 and 198 of the provisional Regulation are confirmed.\n(79) Consequently, as regards anti-dumping duties for India, the countervailing duty in force that corresponds to export subsidies was deducted from the anti-dumping duty to be applied. For any non-cooperating companies, the deduction corresponds to the export subsidy of the cooperating company on the basis of which the residual dumping margin (and thus the residual duty) was established.\n(80) On the basis of the above, and taking into account the findings of the previous anti-subsidy investigation, the proposed definitive duty rates, expressed on the cif Community border price, customs duty unpaid, are as follows:\nIndia\nTABLE\nKorea\nTABLE\n(81) The individual company anti-dumping duty rates specified in this Regulation were established on the basis of the findings of the present investigation. Therefore, they reflect the situation found during that investigation with respect to these companies. These duty rates (as opposed to the country-wide duty applicable to \"all other companies\") are thus exclusively applicable to imports of products originating in the country concerned and produced by the companies and thus by the specific legal entities mentioned. Imported products produced by any other company not specifically mentioned in the operative part of this Regulation with its name and address, including entities related to those specifically mentioned, cannot benefit from these rates and shall be subject to the duty rate applicable to \"all other companies\".\n(82) Any claim requesting the application of these individual company anti-dumping duty rates (e.g. following a change in the name of the entity or following the setting up of new production or sales entities) should be addressed to the Commission(4) forthwith with all relevant information, in particular any modification in the company's activities linked to production, domestic and export sales associated with e.g. that name change or that change in the production and sales entities. The Commission will, if appropriate, after consultation of the Advisory Committee, amend the Regulation accordingly by updating the list of companies benefiting from individual duty rates.\n3. Collection of provisional duties\n(83) In view of the magnitude of the dumping margins found and in the light of the level of the injury caused to the Community industry, it is considered necessary that the amounts secured by way of the provisional anti-dumping duty, imposed by the provisional Regulation, should be definitively collected at the rate of the duty definitively imposed. Where the definitive duties are higher than the provisional duties, only the amounts secured at the level of the provisional duties should be definitively collected.\n4. Undertakings\n(84) Subsequent to the imposition of provisional anti-dumping measures, a number of exporting producers in India offered price undertakings in accordance with Article 8(1) of the basic Regulation. By doing so, they have agreed to sell the product concerned at or above price levels which eliminate the injurious effects of dumping. The companies will also provide the Commission with regular and detailed information concerning their exports to the Community, meaning that the undertakings can be monitored effectively by the Commission. Furthermore, the sales structure of these exporting producers is such that the Commission considers that the risk of circumventing the agreed undertaking is limited.\n(85) In view of this, the offers of undertakings are therefore considered acceptable and the companies concerned have been informed of the essential facts, considerations and obligations upon which acceptance is based.\n(86) To further enable the Commission to effectively monitor the compliance of the companies with their undertakings, when the request for release for free circulation is presented to the relevant customs authority, exemption from the anti-dumping duty shall be conditional on the presentation of a commercial invoice containing at least the elements listed in the Annex. This level of information is also necessary to enable customs authorities to ascertain with sufficient precision that shipments correspond to the commercial documents. Where no such invoice is presented, or when it does not correspond to the product presented to customs, the appropriate rate of anti-dumping duty will instead be payable.\n(87) It should be noted that in the event of a breach or withdrawal of the undertaking or a suspected breach, an anti-dumping duty may be imposed, pursuant to Article 8(9) and (10) of the basic Regulation.\n5. Duration of measures\n(88) The anti-dumping measures would be in force until 2006, whereas the existing countervailing duties against India are bound to expire in 2004. In the event of the expiry (or change) of the countervailing measures, the level of the anti-dumping duties should be revised, since they currently take account of the fact that countervailing duties are already in place,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\n1. A definitive anti-dumping duty is hereby imposed on imports of polyethylene terephthalate (\"PET\") film falling within CN codes ex 3920 62 19 and ex 3920 62 90 (TARIC codes: 3920 62 19*10, 3920 62 19*15, 3920 62 19*25, 3920 62 19*30, 3920 62 19*35, 3920 62 19*40, 3920 62 19*45, 3920 62 19*50, 3920 62 19*55, 3920 62 19*60, 3920 62 19*62, 3920 62 19*64, 3920 62 19*65, 3920 62 19*70, 3920 62 19*75, 3920 62 19*80, 3920 62 19*81, 3920 62 19*85, 3920 62 19*87, 3920 62 19*89, 3920 62 19*91, 3920 62 90*30 and 3920 62 90*91 ) and originating in India and the Republic of Korea.\n2.

By letter dated 18 May 2000, D/53023, the Commission sent these comments to Spain, asking for observations, but did not receive any.\n(6) By letter from the Permanent Representation dated 22 June 2000, the Spanish authorities informed the Commission that, since the seventh additional provision of Provincial Law No 36/1998 of 17 December 1998, which formed the legal basis for the 45 % tax credit in 1999, had not been extended, the new tax credits had ceased to be applicable as from 1 January 2000.\nII. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE AID\n(7) According to the information at the Commission's disposal, which has not been questioned by the Spanish authorities or by third parties, the tax aid in question entered into force on 1 January 1995, pursuant to the sixth additional provision of Provincial Law(5) No 22/1994 of 20 December 1994(6), for a period of one year. These measures were subsequently extended under the fifth additional provision of Provincial Law(7) No 33/1995 of 20 December 1995 until the end of 1996, and under the seventh additional provision of Provincial Law(8) No 31/1996 of 18 December 1996 until the end of 1997. In addition, they were amended under point 2.11 of the derogating provision in Provincial Law No 24/1996 of 5 July 1996 on corporation tax(9). Under the eleventh additional provision of Provincial Law No 33/1997 of 19 December 1997(10), the provincial authorities introduced new incentives for 1998, similar in large part to the above aid. Under the seventh additional provision of Provincial Law No 36/1998 of 17 December 1998(11), the provincial authorities introduced further new incentives exclusively for 1999, which were also largely similar to the tax aid for the previous year.\n(8) As regards the 45 % tax credit in force from 1 January to 31 December 1995, the sixth additional provision of Provincial Law No 22/1994 of 20 December 1994 reads as follows: \"Investments in new tangible fixed assets carried out between 1 January 1995 and 31 December 1995 and exceeding ESP 2500 million shall, by decision of the Álava Provincial Council, qualify for a tax credit equivalent to 45 % of the amount of the investment, as determined by the Álava Provincial Council, to be offset against the amount of personal tax liability.\nAny tax credit not used up because it exceeds the amount of tax liability may be carried forward and used for up to nine years following that in which the decision of the Álava Provincial Council is taken.\nThe decision of the Álava Provincial Council shall lay down the time limits and restrictions applicable in each individual case.\nBenefits granted under this provision shall be incompatible with any other tax concessions for which the same investments may be eligible.\nThe Álava Provincial Council shall also decide on the duration of the investment process, which may include investments made during the preparatory phase of the project which generates the investments.\"\n(9) As regards the legal basis for the 45 % tax credit in force from 1 January 1996 to 31 December 1997, the amendment to the above text consisted in deleting the reference to nine years in the second paragraph. Thus, non-deduction on account of insufficient liability could be applied indefinitely.\n(10) As regards the legal basis of the tax credit in force from 1 January to 31 December 1998, the eleventh additional provision of Provincial Law No 33/1997 of 19 December 1997 reads as follows: \"1. For 1998 only, investments initiated as from 1 January 1998 which exceed ESP 2500 million will be eligible for the tax credit of 45 % of the investment. The tax credit shall apply to net personal liability.\n2. Any tax credit not used up because it exceeds the amount of tax liability may be carried forward to subsequent years.\n3. The investment process shall include those investments made during the preparatory phase of the project which generates the investments and with a necessary, direct link to that process.\n4. The application of the tax credit to which this general provision refers shall be notified by the taxpayer to the Álava Provincial Council, using the form approved for that purpose by the Provincial Commission for Tax, Finance and Budgets.\n5. Concessions granted under this provision may not be combined with any other tax concessions available in respect of the same investments.\"\n(11) As regards the 45 % tax credit in force from 1 January to 31 December 1999, the eleventh additional provision of Provincial Law No 36/1998 of 17 December 1998 reads as follows: \"1. For 1999 only, investments initiated as from 1 January 1999 which exceed ESP 2500 million will be eligible for the tax credit of 45 % of the investment. The tax credit shall apply to net personal liability.\n2. Any grants received by the taxpayer shall not be included in the figure of ESP 2500 million referred to in the previous paragraph.\n3. Any grants received by the taxpayer shall not be included in the base to which the tax credit applies.\n4. Any tax credit not used up because it exceeds the amount of tax liability may be carried forward to subsequent years.\n5. The investment process shall include those investments made during the preparatory phase of the project which generates the investments and with a necessary, direct link to that process.\n6. The application of the tax credit to which this general provision refers shall be notified by the taxpayer to the Álava Provincial Council, using the form approved for that purpose by the Provincial Commission for Tax, Finance and Budgets.\n7. Concessions granted under this provision may not be combined with any other tax concessions available in respect of the same investments.\"\n(12) In short, it is clear from the above provisions that the aid is granted in respect of, firstly, investments in new tangible fixed assets made during the period from 1 January 1995 to 31 December 1997, and then the investment process from 1 January 1998 to 31 December 1999, and secondly the investment expenditure incurred in the preparatory stage(12) of the project which generates the investments, provided that they exceed ESP 2500 million and were initiated between 1 January 1995 and 31 December 1999.\n(13) In addition, between 1 January and 31 December 1999, any grants received by the beneficiary are not taken into account either when establishing whether the investment exceeds the threshold of ESP 2500 million or when determining the taxable income to which the tax credit of 45 % applies.\n(14) Since the scheme does not require the investment entitling firms to the aid to be located in Álava, a firm resident there for tax purposes could obtain a tax credit equivalent to 45 % of the amount of investments made outside Álava.\n(15) The scheme is furthermore applicable to investments made in any sector and is not subject to any sectoral restriction such as those laid down in the Community sectoral rules applicable to the production, processing and marketing of the agricultural products in Article I to the Treaty, fisheries, coalmining, steelmaking, transport, shipbuilding, synthetic fibres and the motor industry.\n(16) Furthermore, any firm may qualify for the 45 % tax credit in question irrespective of its economic and financial position, even if it is a firm in difficulty.\n(17) Although the 45 % tax credit may not be combined with any other tax concessions that may be granted in respect of the same investment, combination with other, non-tax aid, including grants, subsidised loans, guarantees, equity purchases, etc., relating to the same investments is not ruled out.\n(18) In its decision initiating the procedure, the Commission pointed out that as far as the application of the Community State aid rules is concerned, the tax nature of the measures in question is irrelevant, since Article 87 of the Treaty applies to aid measures \"in any form\". The Commission also emphasised, however, that, to be regarded as aid, the measures must meet all four of the criteria set out in Article 87 and explained below.\n(19) Firstly, the Commission pointed out that the tax credit confers on the recipients an advantage amounting to 45 % of the amount of the investments and relieves them of charges that are normally borne from their budgets through a partial reduction in their net tax liability.\n(20) Secondly, the Commission considered provisionally that the said tax credit involves a loss of tax revenue and is therefore equivalent to the consumption of public resources in the form of fiscal expenditure.\n(21) Thirdly, the Commission considered that the tax credit affects competition and trade between Member States. Since the recipients conduct business which may be the subject of intra-Community trade, the aid strengthens their position vis-à-vis competitors who are also involved in intra-Community trade and therefore affects such trade. Furthermore, the recipient firms' profitability is improved by the increase in their net profit (profit after tax). In this way they are more able to compete with firms which are not eligible for the aid.\n(22) Lastly, the Commission considered that the 45 % tax credit is specific or selective in that it favours certain firms, since only firms which make investments exceeding the ESP 2500 million (ECU 15025303) threshold are eligible. All other firms whose investments do not exceed that threshold are ineligible.\n(23) Furthermore, the Commission considered that the selective nature of the concession is also due to a discretionary power of the tax authorities: the Álava Provincial Council has a discretionary power to determine, in particular, the investments that are eligible for the 45 % tax credit and the duration of the investment process and of the preparatory phase of the investments qualifying for the aid.\n(24) In short, the Commission considered that the 45 % tax credit is State aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) of the Treaty and Article 61(1) of the Agreement on the European Economic Area, since it meets the cumulative criteria of constituting an advantage, being granted by the State from State resources, affecting trade between Member States and distorting competition in favour of certain firms.\n(25) Since the tax incentive in question is not subject, among other requirements, to the condition that it does not exceed EUR 100000 over a period of three years, the Commission considered, at that stage, that it cannot be regarded as subject to the de minimis rule(13).\n(26) The Commission stated that State aid which is not governed by the de minimis rule is subject to the obligation of prior notification laid down in Article 88(3) of the Treaty and Article 62(3) of the EEA Agreement. However, the Spanish authorities have not fulfilled this obligation. The Commission therefore considered provisionally that the aid could be regarded as unlawful.\n(27) The Commission also found that the 45 % tax credit is aid conditional on investment(14). However, in the absence of a precise definition of the eligible expenditure, the Commission could not rule out at that stage the possibility that some of the investment expenditure qualifying for the 45 % tax credit might fall within the scope of the Community definition of initial investment(15).\n(28) As regards the investment expenditure falling within the scope of the Community definition, the Commission took the view at that stage that the 45 % tax credit wholly or partly constitutes investment aid. It must therefore be examined in the light of the Community rules on investment aid. On the other hand, any aid to defray investment expenditure which does not fall within the Community definition cannot be regarded as investment aid and has to be considered as aid for other purposes, for example operating aid.\n(29) The 45 % tax credit, which is not restricted to a particular sector, may be granted to firms that are subject to Community sectoral rules. The Commission therefore questioned at that stage whether the aid was compatible where the recipient belongs to a sector subject to special Community rules.\n(30) The same applies where the 45 % tax credit is granted to firms in difficulty within the meaning of the Community guidelines on State aid for rescuing and restructuring firms in difficulty. However, the grant of the tax aid in question is not subject to the conditions laid down in those guidelines. Since it does not meet the said conditions, the aid gave rise at that stage to doubts as to its compatibility with the common market where it is intended for firms in difficulty.\n(31) As regards the application of the derogation in Article 87(3)(c) of the Treaty to the aid for investment in Álava, the Commission pointed out that, during the period 1995 to 1999, two successive regional aid maps were in force. Firstly, the map approved in 1998 by Commission Decision 88/C 351/04 provided that only certain areas of Álava (subject to 20 % and 30 % ceilings) could apply for aid and that the rest of the territory was not eligible for the derogation in Article 87(3)(c) of the Treaty. Secondly, the map approved by the Commission Decision of 26 July 1995 provided that from that date the whole of Álava could qualify for aid (subject to a ceiling of 25 % nge).\n(32) The Commission also pointed out provisionally that the ceilings in question apply only to certain eligible expenditure included in the standard base and complying with the Community definition of initial investment, which excludes inter alia replacement investments. It stressed that aid granted between 1 January and 31 December 1999 is subject to the above regional aid guidelines, so that investment aid not exceeding the ceilings is also subject to certain additional conditions laid down in those guidelines.\n(33) However, the Commission observed, at this preliminary stage, that the 45 % tax credit was not limited (in the period from 1 January to 26 July 1995) to the industrial zone of the Nervión valley and the areas in the Pyrenees (which were the only areas eligible for aid under the regional aid map current at the time) and was not subject to the 30 %, 25 % and 20 % nge ceilings, depending on the area and the period in question, in the case of large firms, nor to the 30 % nge ceiling in the case of SMEs located in the eligible areas. Outside these areas, the aid was not limited to 15 % gge in the case of small enterprises and 7,5 % gge in the case of medium-sized enterprises. The Commission also found that the eligible expenditure could not be adapted to that in the said standard base. Accordingly, it could not rule out the possibility that the aid could rank as operating aid, since it was intended to reduce the recipient firms' current expenditure. It therefore took the view that there were doubts about the compatibility of the tax incentives with the rules on regional aid.\n(34) As regards the period after 1 September 1998, the Commission considered that the possibility that investment for which aid was granted was covered by the multisectoral framework on regional aid for large investment projects (98/C 107/05) could not be ruled out. However, the tax aid in question was not subject to the notification requirement where large projects are concerned or to a possible reduction in aid intensity that might result from the Commission's assessment. The Commission therefore stated provisionally that there were doubts as to the compatibility of the tax aid where large projects were concerned.\n(35) To sum up, the Commission questioned the compatibility of the tax aid with the common market in the light of the derogation in Article 87(3)(c), which concerns \"aid to facilitate the development (...) of certain economic areas (...)\". Neither did it appear that the other derogations in Article 87(2) and (3) of the Treaty could apply. The tax credit could not be regarded as aid having a social character under Article 87(2)(a), was not intended to make good the damage caused by natural disasters or exceptional occurrences under Article 87(2)(b) and is not subject to the provisions of Article 87(2)(c) concerning \"aid to facilitate the development of certain economic activities (...)\". Furthermore, its object was not to promote the execution of an important project of common European interest, nor to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy of a Member State, as provided for in Article 87(3)(b). Finally, it was not intended to promote culture and heritage conservation within the meaning of Article 87(3)(d).\n(36) As well as inviting them to submit their comments under the Article 88(2) procedure, the Commission also asked the Spanish authorities to supply all the information necessary for assessing the 45 % tax credit in Álava. This information related in particular to: any tax credit for investments available in any year during the period 1986 to 1994, copies of all decisions granting the aid during the period 1995 to 1997 and copies of the declarations made by the firms concerned to the Provincial Council in 1998 and 1999, on the official form, setting out, at least, the nature of the investment expenditure qualifying for the aid, the amount of the tax credit granted to each recipient, the aid actually paid to each recipient and any balance still outstanding, whether the recipient constituted a firm in difficulty within the meaning of the Community guidelines on State aid for rescuing and restructuring firms in difficulty, the details of any combination of aid (amount, eligible expenditure, where appropriate the aid schemes applied, etc.), and precise and detailed definitions of what constituted \"investments\" and \"investments made during the preparatory phase\".\nIII. COMMENTS OF THE SPANISH AUTHORITIES\n(37) The Spanish authorities submitted their comments by letter from the Permanent Representation dated 9 November 1999. Essentially, they take the view that the tax credit does not constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 87 of the Treaty. In support of their view, they challenge the Commission's assumption that trade will be affected because the companies benefiting from the incentive carry out economic activities which may involve trade between Member States. In their opinion, it cannot be established, pace the Commission, that trade is affected generally, but only in specific cases, since there is a possibility that in some cases it will not be affected. In such cases, therefore, one of the prerequisites for classifying an official measure as State aid is missing.\n(38) They also argue that the measure is not specific or selective in character. In their opinion, the opening of the measure to all sectors and to all taxpayers that meet the appropriate criteria removes any specific character. Furthermore, since there are five separate tax systems in Spain, one of which in Álava, the tax rules applicable in that territory have the status of general measures for the taxpayers to whom they apply. The measure therefore has no regional specificity.\n(39) As to specificity of scope, this does not exist, since the measure is open to all sectors and to all taxpayers. The Spanish authorities maintain that the requirement to invest ESP 2500 million is not discriminatory, but an objective condition deriving from the need to ensure the effectiveness of the measure and thus achieve the proposed objective. However, even if the Commission were to consider that the measure was specific, it would be justified by the nature and general scheme of the system, as provided for in Commission notice 98/C 384/03(16). The measure in question is justified by the nature of the tax system, since it forms part of the single tax system applicable in the territory of Álava and derives from the exercise of the Provincial Council's powers to adopt measures in the tax field; it is also justified by the general scheme of the tax system, since its objective is to promote economic activity. Moreover, it seems logical that the incentives should be targeted at large investments, since, firstly, it is these that will actually benefit Álava in the long term, enabling the tax authorities to collect tax revenues in excess of the fiscal expenditure borne at the start of the investment projects, and, secondly, the minimum investment threshold does not harm small and medium-sized firms, as they already benefit from many Community financing programmes.\n(40) In addition, the Spanish authorities dispute that the relevant measures between 1995 and 1997 are discretionary, arguing that the aid is granted automatically once the condition of investing a minimum of ESP 2500 million is satisfied. The Provincial Council can thus check only that all the conditions are satisfied; it cannot alter or add any conditions. The Spanish authorities also stress that Spanish tax law does not allow arbitrary decisions when it comes to determining the fundamental characteristics of taxpayers' obligations. The rules have been amended since 1997 and all the features which the Commission regards as discretionary have been repealed.\n(41) The Spanish authorities reject the Commission's view that the tax rules do not satisfy the conditions of the sectoral rules. In their opinion, the Commission ought to determine what the specific conditions are that are infringed by the said tax rules. As regards the application of the tax rules to firms in difficulty, they consider that the condition of investing at least ESP 2500 million makes it extremely difficult for such firms to obtain the tax credit; it should be regarded more as a guarantee that firms in difficulty will not qualify for the incentive. The Spanish authorities consider that the application of the rules on regional aid is inappropriate, since in this specific case no State aid is involved.\n(42) In view of the above arguments, the Spanish authorities consider that the Commission should terminate the Article 88(2) procedure by a decision finding that the tax measures in question do not meet the criteria for being regarded as State aid.\n(43) For the rest, the Spanish authorities do not consider it necessary to supply the information requested by the Commission concerning, in particular, decisions to grant the tax credit, since no State aid is involved. Consequently, they are not providing any of the information requested in the decision initiating the procedure.\nIV. OTHER COMMENTS RECEIVED BY THE COMMISSION\n(44) The Commission emphasises that the comments set out below are without prejudice to the question of whether the parties which submitted them can be considered interested parties within the meaning of Article 88(2) of the Treaty.\nComments by the Comunidad Autónoma de Castilla y León\n(45) The Autonomous Community of Castile-Leon points out first of all that the tax measures in question are part of a set of tax measures adopted by the Álava Provincial Council that have been contested both in Spain and at Community level.\n(46) It states that the tax measures in question constitute State aid, since they satisfy all four criteria laid down in Article 87 of the Treaty. In support of this contention it basically puts forward the same arguments as those given in the decision initiating the procedure.\n(47) It also considers that the tax aid cannot be regarded as compatible by virtue of the derogations in Article 87 of the Treaty. Furthermore, the obligation to notify laid down in Article 88(3) of the Treaty has not been complied with.\n(48) The Autonomous Community of Castile-Leon takes the view, therefore, that the tax measures in question should be regarded as State aid which is unlawful, since the notification procedure laid down in Article 88(3) has not been followed, and which is incompatible with the common market.\nComments from the Basque Business Confederation (Confederación Empresarial Vasca/Euskal Entrepresarien Konfederakuntza (Confebask))\n(49) Confebask started by drawing attention to the underlying historical reasons for the tax autonomy enjoyed by Álava. As regards substance, Confebask's views are essentially as follows:\n(a) the presumed reduction of the tax debt: the Commission is wrong to think that there is a tax debt whose reduction involves a loss of tax revenue. If this argument were sound, any tax deduction would always involve a loss of revenue compared with the amount initially due. Confebask therefore asks the Commission to reconsider its position, since otherwise it could be argued that taxes were being unlawfully harmonised by establishing a normal amount in relation to which any losses of tax revenue would have to be determined;\n(b) the effect on trade: according to the Commission, where the recipients participate in intra-Community trade, the tax measures in question distort that trade. However, differences between tax systems always affect trade. To determine the extent to which trade is affected, the Commission should therefore analyse the entire tax system and not specific provisions. Confebask emphasises in this respect that, according to one study, the tax burden in the Basque Country is greater than in the rest of Spain. The Commission should explain why these specific measures and not other tax differences affect trade. In any event, even if such an effect did exist, the way to remove it would be through harmonisation, not State aid;\n(c) the selective character of the aid: in Confebask's opinion, the selective nature of the tax measures should be assessed in one of two ways, either as an enabling rule conferring power on the tax authority subsequently to grant a specific relief, or as a rule directly granting the tax relief without requiring subsequent specification. The Commission, however, is using one argument which fits the first category, and another which fits the second. Given that the two are mutually exclusive, the Commission should explain in which category the tax measures in question fall, since otherwise it would be contradictory to try and use both.\n- Confebask questions the approach whereby the tax measures are regarded as enabling rules, since the reduction is granted automatically and the authorities, accordingly, had no discretionary power either before 1997 or thereafter. The authorities are restricted to checking that the applicant satisfies the tests of eligibility. Moreover, if the tax measures are regarded as enabling rules which subsequently make it possible to grant the aid, it has to be concluded that the current procedure, in so far as it is the rules that are being questioned and not specific instances of their application, is meaningless. Similarly, according to the first paragraph of the Commission's letter to the Member States(17), a general provision conferring relief is regarded as aid only if \"legislative machinery enabling it to be granted without further formality has been set up\". By contrast, because it is abstract, an enabling rule cannot be regarded as State aid and, hence, cannot be assessed for its effect on competition and trade between Member States.\n- As for regarding the tax measures as rules granting aid directly, Confebask points out that, according to points 19, 20 and 17 of notice 98/C 384/03, a tax measure may be specific and, hence, may be State aid, if it is aimed solely at public undertakings, certain types of undertaking or undertakings in a given region. However, the tax measures in question have none of these characteristics, not even territorial specificity, since they apply to the whole territory for which the regional authorities that introduced them are competent. As to the specific character of the threshold of ESP 2500 million, Confebask considers that the use of objective thresholds is normal practice in national and Community tax rules. Confebask also draws attention to the basis of various judgments of the Court of Justice and Commission decisions: hitherto, it has never been held that thresholds imply specificity. Moreover, the Commission itself acknowledges, in point 14 of the above notice, that the effect of promoting certain sectors does not necessarily mean that the measures are specific and, in point 207 of the 1998 Competition Report, that measures which have a cross-sectoral impact and are intended to favour the whole of the economy are general measures and do not involve State aid. In short, the tax measures in question are not specific, since they do not promote a particular sector or particular undertakings. On the contrary, they are open to all sectors and to all undertakings established in the territory for which the provincial authorities are competent;\n(d) illegality of the 45 % tax credit: while still disputing that the tax credit constitutes State aid, something that has to be proven in order to classify the measure as illegal, Confebask argues that the Commission's description of the tax credit as unlawful aid calls into question the principles of legitimate expectations, the ban on arbitrary decisions by institutions, legal certainty and proportionality, since the Commission regarded the Basque tax arrangements as lawful in its Decision 93/337/EEC(18). In any event, the Commission could change its position as regards future cases but not as regards past ones. Confebask furthermore regards the tax measures in question as existing aid. In 1983 there were already rules providing for concessions of the same type (deduction of 65 % of the tax payable where new investments were made). In 1984 a threshold of ESP 500 million was introduced as a qualifying condition for a tax credit amounting to 50 % of investments. According to the definition given in Article 1(a) of Council Regulation (EC) No 659/1999 of 22 March 1999 laying down detailed rules for the application of Article 93 of the EC Treaty(19), \"existing aid\" means \"all aid which existed prior to the entry into force of the Treaty in the respective Member States, that is to say, aid schemes and individual aid which were put into effect before, and are still applicable after, the entry into force of the Treaty\". The aid under examination here is therefore legal for the purposes of Article 88(3) of the Treaty;\n(e) incompatibility with the common market: if the tax measures in question are regarded as enabling rules, Confebask considers that their compatibility cannot be assessed while the aid is not granted through an administrative decision. The procedure is meaningless and incapable by definition of yielding any results as to the compatibility of the aid. On the other hand, if the tax measures in question are regarded as rules granting aid directly, Confebask takes the view that the practice of the Commission and the Court requires that measures have to have sectoral specificity before the compatibility of the aid can be assessed. Furthermore, it would be necessary to establish the overall tax burden on firms and the reference tax burden. Lastly, this approach would lead to the absurd conclusion that any tax burden lower than the highest tax burden in all the Member States would constitute State aid. Confebask also rejects the Commission's argument that the said tax measures are incompatible since they do not contain specific provisions on sectoral or regional aid, or aid for large investment projects, etc.: tax measures may not and should not contain this type of provision. According to the Court of Justice(20), the Commission should specify in its decisions what the adverse effects on competition are, determining the real effect of the measures examined. Incompatibility cannot be determined, therefore, in abstract situations specific to a tax system, since in that case any differences between tax systems would necessarily become aid. This leads Confebask to repeat that there is no normal tax debt which has been reduced by the tax measures in question;\n(f) Confebask therefore asks the Commission to adopt a final decision terminating the procedure and finding that the tax measures in question comply with Community law.\n(50) Confebask's additional comments, communicated by letter dated 29 December 2000, registered on 3 January 2001, were not taken into account, as they reached the Commission after the deadline had expired(21). Furthermore, Confebask did not apply for an extension of the time limit pursuant to Article 6(1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 659/1999.\nComments from the Rioja Regional Government\n(51) The Rioja Government's comments, sent by fax dated 19 April 2000, registered on 25 April 2000, were not taken into account, as they reached the Commission after the deadline had expired. Furthermore, the Rioja Regional Government did not apply for an extension of the time limit pursuant to Article 6(1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 659/1999.\nV. COMMUNICATION OF THE THIRD PARTIES' COMMENTS TO SPAIN\n(52) By letter to the Spanish Permanent Representation, dated 18 May 2000, the Commission sent, pursuant to Article 6(2) of the aforesaid Regulation (EC) No 659/1999, the third parties' comments to Spain, inviting it to submit its observations within one month of the date of the letter, but it received only a request for a 20-day extension of the deadline for replying. Spain has not submitted any such observations, therefore.\nVI. ASSESSMENT OF THE AID\nVII. CLASSIFICATION AS STATE AID\n(53) The Commission would point out that, for the purpose of applying the Community rules on State aid, the tax nature of the measures in question does not matter, since Article 87 of the Treaty applies to aid measures \"in any form\". Nevertheless, the Commission emphasises that, to be regarded as aid, the measures in question should together satisfy all four of the criteria set out in Article 87 and explained below.\n(54) Firstly, the measure must confer on recipients an advantage which relieves them of charges that are normally borne from their budgets. The advantage may be provided through different types of reduction in the firm's tax burden and, in particular, through an exemption from or reduction in tax liability. The 45 % tax credit meets this criterion, since it reduces the recipient firms' tax burden by an amount equivalent to 45 % of the eligible investment. In the absence of the tax credit, the recipient firm would have to pay its full final tax liability. The tax credit thus implies an exception to the common tax system applicable.\n(55) Secondly, the Commission considers that the said 45 % tax credit involves a loss of tax revenue and is therefore equivalent to the consumption of public resources in the form of fiscal expenditure. This criterion is also applied to aid granted by regional and local bodies in the Member States(22). Furthermore, the intervention of the State can be effected both through tax provisions of a statutory, regulatory or administrative kind and through the practices of the tax authorities. In this specific case, State intervention is effected through the Álava Provincial Council on the basis of a statutory provision.\n(56) The argument put forward in certain comments by third parties, to the effect that it would be wrong to regard the 45 % tax credit as involving a loss of tax revenue compared to the normal amount (determined by the Commission) of the tax due, is a fallacious one. It has to be pointed out that the normal level of tax derives from the tax system in question and not from any Commission decision allegedly pursuing a hidden agenda of tax harmonisation. Furthermore, according to the second indent in point 9 of notice 98/C 384/03, to qualify as State aid, \"firstly, the measure must confer on recipients an advantage which relieves them of charges that are normally borne from their budgets. The advantage may be provided through a reduction in the firm's tax burden in various ways, including: (...) a total or partial reduction in the amount of tax (such as exemption or a tax credit)\". This is the case with the relief in the form of the 45 % tax credit. The comment is therefore without foundation.\n(57) Thirdly, the measure must affect competition and trade between Member States. It should be pointed out in this respect that, according to a report on the external dependency of the Basque economy in the period 1990 to 1995(23), exports abroad went up(24), not only in absolute terms but, in particular, in relative terms as well, to the detriment of exports to the rest of Spain. The foreign market thus partly replaced the market which is the rest of Spain. Furthermore, according to another statistical report on the foreign trade of the Basque Country(25), at 28,9 % the Basque economy's \"propensity to export\" (ratio of exports to GDP) is greater than that of Germany and the other Member States, where it is about 20 %. According to this report, the Basque trade balance was clearly in surplus during the period 1993 to 1998. In particular, in 1998, for each ESP 100 of imports there were ESP 144 of exports. In short, the Basque economy is very open to the outside, and its production is very much geared to exporting. Given these characteristics of the Basque economy, it may be deduced that recipient firms are engaged in economic activities which are likely to include intra-Community trade. Consequently, aid strengthens their position vis-à-vis their competitors in intra-Community trade, thereby affecting such trade. Furthermore, the recipient firms' profitability is improved by the increase in their net profit (profit after tax). This enables them to compete with firms which are not eligible for the tax credit, either because they have not invested, or because their investments have not reached the threshold of ESP 2500 million following the introduction of the tax credit.\n(58) Since, in this case, the tax rules under examination are general and abstract in character, the Commission would point out that the analysis of their impact on trade can only be carried out at a general, abstract level; it is not possible to specify to what extent they affect a market, sector or specific product, as is stated in the abovementioned comments by third parties. This position has been confirmed on a number of occasions by Court of Justice case-law(26).\n(59) As regards certain comments from third parties which maintain that the effect on trade should be assessed by the Commission on the basis of a comparison of all tax systems, the Commission would point out that the distortions of competition which are the subject of this procedure under Articles 87 and 88 of the Treaty are due to a derogating rule which favours certain firms vis-à-vis the other firms of the Member State; they are not possible distortions of competition which are due to differences between the tax systems of the Member States, which might, as appropriate, be caught by the provisions of Articles 93 to 97.\n(60) As regards the specific character which State aid must have, the Commission takes the view that the 45 % tax credit is specific or selective in that it favours certain firms, since only firms which, after 1 January 1995, make investments exceeding the ESP 2500 million (EUR 15025303) threshold are eligible. All other firms whose investments do not exceed that threshold are ineligible. The objective character of the threshold cited does not prevent it, as the Spanish authorities and some of the third-party comments claim, from being selective and excluding firms which do not satisfy the conditions in question.\n(61) The Commission is of the opinion, in the alternative, that the 45 % tax credit is specific on the grounds of the discretionary power of the tax authorities. In this case, the Commission finds that Álava Provincial Council had more of a discretionary power to alter the aid than to grant it. In 1995, 1996 and 1997, the Álava Provincial Council had to decide whether to grant the 45 % tax credit, since it was not automatic, determine the size of the investments to which the tax credit would apply, set the time limits and limitations that would apply in each case and, lastly, decide on the duration of the investment process, which could include investments made during the preparatory phase of the project generating the investments. All these powers of the Álava Provincial Council give it discretion to determine the size or the characteristics of the 45 % tax credit in the light of the particular circumstances of each applicant. A further discretionary feature is the scope for determining the investments made in the preparatory stage of the project which generates the investments. It should be noted that, in the decision initiating the procedure, the Commission pointed out that there was no precise, objective definition of this type of investment. No information on this point has been supplied, either in the comments submitted by the Spanish authorities or in those of third parties. However, the fact that there is no precise and generally accepted definition would seem to give the regional authorities scope to determine the amount of this type of investment.\n(62) The Commission notes, furthermore, that from 1 January 1998 some of the conditions were altered or even abolished. Instead, a new concept, the \"investment process\", was introduced, replacing \"investments in new tangible fixed assets\", which had applied from 1 January 1995 to 31 December 1997. It should be noted that the provincial laws introducing the concept of \"investment process\" do not define it. Unlike the concept of \"investments in tangible fixed assets\", which is defined in accounting rules(27) and other provisions(28), there is no precise and generally accepted definition of the \"investment process\". In the absence of a precise definition, therefore, the regional authorities have some leeway in determining exactly what is meant by the \"investment process\" in the case of each recipient.\n(63) It should also be stressed that, while in Decision 93/337/EEC the Commission used only the criterion of territorial or sectoral specificity in order to demonstrate the specific or selective nature of the aid under the scheme in question, this does not mean that the aid could not have displayed other types of specificity in relation to other criteria. For an official measure to be classed as selective or specific, in relation to State aid, it is enough to identify a single feature. There is therefore no need for each Commission decision to examine exhaustively every specific feature that may be displayed by the official measures under consideration in order to demonstrate that they are selective. Consequently, the argument put forward in some third-party comments, to the effect that because the Commission did not mention the selective nature of the minimum investment threshold as a condition of eligibility for the aid, it did not deem it to be selective, cannot be accepted.\n(64) As regards the existence of tax measures in the form of tax credits for investments above a given threshold in other Member States, which the Commission did not consider selective in scope because of the threshold; according to certain comments by third parties, this leads to a legitimate expectation concerning all similar tax credits. The Commission would point out that the schemes mentioned by some of the parties are very different from the 45 % tax credit. Furthermore, even supposing that certain schemes were similar and that the Commission had not reacted, it would not be justified in taking this misguided approach in the present case. It should be pointed out that, according to the case-law of the Court of Justice, \"any breach by a Member State of an obligation under the Treaty in connection with the prohibition laid down in Article 92 cannot be justified by the fact that other Member States are also failing to fulfil this obligation. The effects of more than one distortion of competition on trade between Member States do not cancel one another out but accumulate and the damaging consequences to the common market are increased\"(29).\n(65) Concerning the question raised in some of the third-party comments about whether the Provincial Law in question has the character of an enabling rule or a rule granting aid directly, the Commission would point out that, in this case, the rules which introduced the 45 % tax credit have the character of an aid scheme. In support of this assessment, it is sufficient to point out that under Article 1(d) of Regulation (EC) No 659/1999 an aid scheme is defined as \"a system on the basis of which, without further implementing measures being required, individual aid awards may be made to undertakings defined within the act in a general and abstract manner (...)\". However, this character of an aid scheme does not predetermine, as certain third-party comments claim, whether there is any discretionary power in the execution of the scheme or not. Discretionary power in regard to the granting of the aid will depend on the specific characteristics of the scheme.\n(66) As regards invoking the nature or general scheme of the tax system as justification for the 45 % tax credit, as the Spanish authorities seek to do, the Commission emphasises that what matters is determining whether the tax measures involved meet the objectives inherent in the tax system itself, or whether, on the contrary, they pursue other, possibly legitimate, objectives outside the tax system. In the case at issue, the 45 % tax credit does not fulfil the internal objectives of the Spanish tax system, which, apart from the principal objective inherent in any tax system of collecting revenue for financing public expenditure, is founded on the principles of equality and progressiveness.(30) In this regard it has to be pointed out that the 45 % tax credit involves(31) a discrimination in favour of large economic units at the expense of other smaller and less powerful units, without such discrimination being justified by the internal logic of the tax system. In short, because it does not comply with the internal principles inherent in the tax system, the 45 % tax credit cannot be justified by the nature or general scheme of that system. Neither does the fact that the tax credit was introduced by the provincial authorities with powers in the tax field demonstrate, contrary to what the Spanish authorities claim in their comments, that it is consistent with the nature of the tax system.\n(67) Moreover, the Spanish authorities state in their comments that the 45 % tax credit satisfies the objective of promoting economic activity. It thus helps to achieve the industrial policy objectives pursued by the Basque Government. According to the Basque Government document entitled Industrial Policy: General Framework of Activities 1996-1999 (Política Industrial. Marco General de Actividades 1996-1999), \"tax policies are essential for boosting economic development and, similarly, for promoting industrial projects based on the industrial development of the Basque Country\" (page 131), and in the chapter \"Tax policy instruments\" one reads: \"the tax autonomy which we have (in the Basque Country) enables us to search for imaginative made-to-measure tax solutions, e.g. for priority projects or even tax incentives for large firms\" (page 133). The 45 % tax credit in question, therefore, is part of an industrial policy whose objectives are not inherent in the tax system.\n(68) In short, the Commission finds that, as the Spanish authorities have pointed out, the 45 % tax credit pursues an economic policy objective which is not inherent in the tax system. It is therefore not justified by the nature or general scheme of the system.\n(69) As to the argument put forward in certain third-party comments concerning the existence of a higher overall tax burden in the Basque Country, the Commission repeats that this is not relevant in the case at issue, since the procedure was initiated in respect of a specific measure and not the whole the tax system of each of the three Basque provinces.\n(70) To sum up, the Commission finds that the 45 % tax credit in question is State aid under Article 87(1) of the Treaty and Article 61(1) of the EEA Agreement, since it involves aid granted by a State, from State resources, which favours certain undertakings, distorts competition and affects trade between Member States.\nVIII. ILLEGALITY OF THE 45 % TAX CREDIT\n(71) Since the scheme does not require a commitment from the Spanish authorities to grant the aid in accordance with the conditions for de minimis aid(32), the Commission considers that the aid cannot be regarded as subject to those rules. It should be stressed in this respect that the Spanish authorities never maintained, in the procedure, that the aid in question should be classed as de minimis aid, either in full or in part. Moreover, it could not comply with the de minimis rules, since in particular there is no guarantee that the ceiling of EUR 100000 would not be exceeded. The incentive does not qualify as existing aid either, since it does not meet the conditions laid down in Article 1(b) of Regulation (EC) No 659/1999.\n(72) The claim made by some third parties that the 45 % tax credit constitutes existing aid must be rejected. In support of that argument, some third-party comments mention the existence of two tax credits prior to the introduction of the 45 % tax credit. However, scrutiny of those two schemes reveals that they differed substantially from the 45 % tax credit under examination. The first scheme did not specify any threshold and the second one established a threshold of ESP 500 million, which is much lower than the ESP 2500 million threshold in the case at issue. In Article 1(c) of Regulation (EC) No 659/1999, new aid is defined as \"all aid, that is to say, aid schemes and individual aid, which is not existing aid, including alterations to existing aid\". The tax credit in question, which involves substantial changes with respect to those schemes, is therefore to be classed as new aid and, in accordance with Article 2(1) of the Regulation, should be notified, save as otherwise provided in regulations adopted pursuant to Article 89 of the Treaty(33). In any case, even the two earlier schemes did not qualify as existing aid since they were apparently not in force on 1 January 1986, when Spain acceded to the European Union. They therefore did not meet the aforesaid criterion laid down in Article 1(b)(i) of Regulation (EC) No 659/1999 of having been put into effect before, and being still applicable after, the date of accession.\n(73) The Commission would point out that State aid which is not covered by the de minimis rule and is not existing aid is subject to the obligation of prior notification laid down in Article 88(3) of the Treaty and Article 62(3) of the EEA Agreement. However, the Spanish authorities have not fulfilled this obligation. The Commission therefore considers that the aid should be regarded as unlawful. The Commission regrets this failure by the Spanish authorities to fulfil their obligation to notify the aid in advance.\n(74) As regards the argument in some of the third-party comments that basically there is a violation of legitimate expectations and legal certainty, the Commission feels bound to reject this, since firstly the 45 % tax credit is not existing aid and, secondly, as it was not notified under Article 88(3) of the Treaty, the Commission was not able to determine whether it is compatible with the common market. Neither can it be accepted that there is a legitimate expectation of the 45 % tax credit being compatible with the common market on the grounds that, as claimed in some of the third-party comments, the Basque tax system was already deemed compatible by Commission Decision 93/337/EEC concerning a scheme of tax concessions for investment. In that Decision, the Commission in fact found that the tax measures concerned were to be classed as State aid and, as such, were subject to the Community rules on State aid (rules on regional aid or aid for SMEs, rules on combination of aid and sectoral rules). Therefore, if as claimed in some third-party comments the 45 % tax credit was a measure similar to the scheme examined in the 1993 Decision, it should, in the first place, have been notified as it is new State aid and, secondly, comply in particular with the rules on regional aid or aid for SMEs, the rules on combination of aid and the sectoral rules. In these circumstances, the recipients cannot rely on any legitimate expectations or legal certainty as regards the State aid nature of the 45 % tax credit.\n(75) In short, as regards the principles of legitimate expectations and legal certainty invoked in the third-party comments, the Commission gave no specific assurances either to the Spanish authorities or to third parties, who could not therefore harbour any legitimate expectations with regard to the legality or compatibility of the aid in question. It should be pointed out in this connection that \"it is settled case-law that the right to protection of legitimate expectations may be claimed by any individual who finds himself in a position in which it is shown that the Community administration gave rise to justified hopes on his part (...). However, no one may plead infringement of the principle of the protection of legitimate expectations in the absence of specific assurances given to him by the administration\"(34). This is why the argument that legitimate expectations or legal certainty have been violated is without foundation in this case. The Commission would also point out in this respect that in its Decision 93/337/EEC it had already deemed certain tax credits introduced in 1988 by the Provinces of Álava, Guipúzcoa and Vizcaya to be State aid.\nIX. ASSESSMENT OF COMPATIBILITY WITH THE COMMON MARKET\n(76) As a preliminary, the Commission would repeat that the 45 % tax credit has to be classed as an aid scheme. Given the general, abstract nature of an aid scheme, the Commission does not know the circumstances of existing or possible future recipient firms and is not, therefore, able to examine the exact repercussions on competition for specific firms. In this context it is sufficient to ascertain that potential recipients could benefit from aid that is not consistent with the Community directives, guidelines and frameworks applicable on this subject. Moreover, the Commission would emphasise that, in its decision initiating the procedure, it asked for all relevant information relating to the aid and the particular circumstances of each recipient. However, the Spanish authorities have not provided any such information. This is why it is contradictory to criticise the Commission, as certain third-party comments do, for providing only a general assessment while at the same time refusing to supply the detailed data requested.\n(77) The State aid in the form of a 45 % tax credit has the effect of encouraging large investments costing more than ESP 2500 million. According to Annex I to the guidelines on national regional aid (98/C 74/06), \"tax aid may be considered to be aid connected with an investment where it is based on an amount invested in the region. In addition, any tax aid may be connected with an investment if one sets a ceiling expressed as a percentage of the amount invested in the region\". In the case in point, the 45 % tax credit fulfils these conditions, at least partly, since it is based on investment expenditure and its amount does not exceed 45 % of the investment. The Commission accordingly takes the view that the 45 % tax credit should be classed as investment aid to the extent that it fulfils the above criteria. It must therefore be examined in the light of the Community rules on investment aid.\n(78) If State aid for investment is to qualify for one of the regional derogations in Article 87(3)(a) or (c) of the Treaty, the region in which the scheme is applied must have been recognised as eligible for one of those derogations on the regional aid map. As regards the admissibility of Álava, the Commission would point out that the territory has never been eligible for the Article 87(3)(a) derogation, since the per capita GDP(35) of the NUTS(36) II region of the Basque Country, of which it forms part, has always been higher than 75 % of the Community average. According to the rules on regional aid(37),(38), the conditions of eligibility for the derogation in Article 87(3)(a) of the Treaty are met only if the region, at NUTS level 2, has a per capita GDP of not more than 75 % of the Community average.\n(79) As regards admissibility for the derogation in Article 87(3)(c), during the period 1995 to 1999 two successive regional aid maps were in force. The first was adopted in 1988 under Commission Decision (88/C 351/04). This provided that investment aid for regional development could be regarded as compatible with the common market under the derogation in Article 87(3)(c), provided that it did not exceed the ceiling of 30 % nge in the case of large firms in the industrial zone of the Nervión valley and 20 % nge in the case of large firms in the Pyrenees. However, investment aid in the rest of Álava could not be regarded as compatible with the common market under the derogation in Article 87(3)(c) of the Treaty.\n(80) The Commission would also point out that, in its Decision of 26 July 1995(39) amending Spain's regional aid map, it proposed, under the procedure laid down in Article 88(1) of the Treaty, that the Spanish authorities should revise the map and consider in future that the whole of Álava was a region in which aid for regional development could be regarded as compatible with the common market under the derogation in Article 87(3)(c), provided that it did not exceed the ceiling of 25 % nge in the case of large firms. By letter from the Permanent Representation dated 26 September 1995, the Spanish authorities accepted this proposal. The new map thus came into force from that date.\n(81) The Commission would also point out that, in the case of SMEs(40), the intensity of investment aid may, in accordance with the SME guidelines(41), be 10 percentage points higher than the regional ceiling for large firms, provided that the total does not exceed 30 % nge.\n(82) It should also be stressed that, to be eligible for investment aid, investments in tangible assets must correspond, in particular, to the Community definitions of initial investment and the standard base(42). Conversely, all other investment expenditure that does not correspond to those definitions, such as replacement investments or expenditure on items other than land, buildings or plant/machinery, is not deemed eligible. Although there is no doubt that the 45 % tax credit is aid granted subject to the carrying-out of a tangible investment(43) in new tangible fixed assets, it does not exclude replacement investments(44) or expenditure related to the \"investment process\" and \"investments made during the preparatory phase\". In the absence of a precise definition of those terms, the possibility cannot be ruled out that the 45 % tax credit could be applied not only to expenditure included in the standard base but also to expenditure linked to replacement investments or other items of expenditure lying outside the standard base. The Commission consequently takes the view that the aid may be applied to initial investment but also to other items of expenditure that cannot be deemed compatible with the relevant Community rules, such as replacement investments.\n(83) The Commission notes that, since the entry into force of the guidelines on national regional aid (98/C 74/06), aid that may qualify for the derogation in Article 87(3)(c) of the Treaty in Álava must not only comply with the abovementioned Community definitions of initial investment and the standard base and observe the applicable ceilings; it must also satisfy other requirements. In the case in point, the aid must be subject to certain conditions: the recipient's contribution to the investment must be at least 25 % (point 4.2); the application for aid must be submitted before the investment projects begin to be implemented (point 4.2); the investment must be maintained for a minimum period of five years (point 4.10); and the respective aid intensity ceilings must be complied with where different types of aid are combined (points 4.18 to 4.21).\n(84) In this particular case, the Commission would observe that the 45 % tax credit was not limited (in the period culminating in the entry into force of its Decision of 26 September 1995) to the industrial zone of the Nervión valley and the areas in the Pyrenees (which were the only areas eligible for aid under the regional aid map current at the time) and were not subject to the 30 %, 25 % and 20 % nge ceilings, depending on the area and the period in question, in the case of large firms, nor to the 30 % nge ceiling in the case of SMEs. Furthermore, the costs that may be accepted for aid may not fully correspond to those included in the standard base since replacement investments are not excluded and other items of expenditure may be accepted. In these circumstances, the Commission finds that a tax credit amounting to 45 % of investments which does not comply with the Community rules on regional aid cannot be deemed compatible with the common market under the regional derogation in Article 87(3)(c) of the Treaty.\n(85) Aid for investment expenditure(45) that does not correspond to the Community definition cannot be regarded as investment aid. In accordance with Annex I to the regional aid guidelines (98/C 74/06), any tax aid may be classed as investment aid where its amount is subject to a ceiling expressed as a percentage of investment expenditure in accordance with the Community rules. However, in the case in point, the amount of the aid represents a percentage of investment expenditure that does not comply with the Community rules. That is why, under those rules, the aid cannot be regarded as investment aid. On the contrary, the aid may finance expenditure of a periodic and necessary nature such as that linked to replacement investments. Such current or periodic expenditure is the type of expenditure that has to be incurred by a firm as part of its day-to-day operations or its normal activities. Aid for this type of investment therefore has to be classed as operating aid and as such is subject to specific rules.\n(86) In this respect, the Commission would point out that, in accordance with the 1988 communication(46) and the regional aid guidelines (98/C 74/06), regional aid which is classed as operating aid is normally prohibited. Exceptionally, however, such aid may be granted in regions eligible under the derogation in Article 87(3)(a) of the Treaty, provided that it meets certain conditions laid down in point 6 of the communication and points 4.15 to 4.17 of the guidelines, in the outermost regions or in regions of low population density if it is intended to offset additional transport costs. However, the NUTS III territory of Álava is not eligible for the derogation in Article 87(3)(a) of the Treaty, and the grant of the said operating aid does not meet the conditions described. The NUTS III territory of Álava is not an outermost region(47) nor a region of low population density(48). This is the reason why the operating aid elements in the 45 % tax credit are prohibited, in particular because they are not granted in a region that is eligible for the derogation in Article 87(3)(a) of the Treaty, in an outermost region or a region of low population density. The aid is therefore incompatible in this case.\n(87) The Commission therefore considers that the tax incentive scheme in question cannot be regarded as compatible with the common market under the regional derogations in Article 87(3)(a) and (c) of the Treaty, since it does not comply with the rules on regional aid.\n(88) With regard to investments made by SMEs outside the assisted areas of Álava in the period from 1 January to 26 July 1995, and outside Álava in the period from 1 January 1995 to 31 December 1999, the Commission would point out that the related aid cannot be considered regional aid and therefore does not qualify for the regional derogation in Article 87(3)(c) of the Treaty. The same applies where such investments are made by large firms. On the other hand, in accordance with the Community guidelines on State aid for small and medium-sized enterprises (96/C 213/04), where the recipient is an SME, the other derogation in Article 87(3)(c), for aid to facilitate the development of certain economic activities, may apply. In addition to requiring compliance with the definition of initial investment and the rules on eligible expenditure forming part of the standard base, the above guidelines state that the exception will apply to aid for tangible investments up to a ceiling of 15 % gross grant equivalent (gge) in the case of small enterprises and 7,5 % gge in the case of medium-sized enterprises. The Commission notes, however, that the 45 % tax credit is not limited to 15 % gge in the case of small enterprises and 7,5 % gge in the case of medium-sized enterprises. Neither are the eligible investments fully in line with the definition of initial investment given in point 4.2.1 of the guidelines, nor are the costs that may be accepted compatible with those forming part of the standard base also laid down in point 4.2.1, since the scheme does not rule out replacement investments or expenditure items other than those covered by the standard base. The Commission accordingly finds that the tax aid under examination cannot be deemed compatible with the common market under the derogation in Article 87(3)(c) of the Treaty for aid to facilitate the development of certain economic activities.\n(89) Furthermore, the scope of the regional aid guidelines (98/C 74/06) excludes the production, processing and marketing of the agricultural products listed in Annex I to the Treaty, fisheries and the coal industry. Transport, steelmaking, shipbuilding, synthetic fibres and the motor industry are subject to special rules over and above those set out in the abovementioned guidelines, while specific rules apply to investments covered by the multisectoral framework on regional aid for large investment projects (98/C 107/05). Those rules must therefore be taken into account in assessing the compatibility of the aid in question where the recipient company belongs to one of those sectors or where the investment falls within the scope of the multisectoral framework.\n(90) The derogation in Article 87(3)(c) of the Treaty has to be examined to see whether it might not apply, in the above cases, for other purposes as well as the development of certain economic activities. It should be noted in this respect that the aim of the 45 % tax credit is not to develop an economic activity within the meaning of Article 87(3)(c) of the Treaty, such as the development of measures to assist small and medium-sized enterprises, research and development, environmental protection, job creation or training in accordance with the appropriate Community rules. Consequently, the tax incentive in question cannot qualify for the derogation in Article 87(3)(c) of the Treaty in respect of the said purposes.\n(91) Similarly, the 45 % tax credit, which is not subject to any sectoral limitation, may be granted without any restriction to undertakings in sensitive sectors subject to specific Community rules, such as those applicable to the production, processing and marketing of the agricultural products in Annex I to the Treaty, fisheries, coalmining, steelmaking, shipbuilding, synthetic fibres and the motor industry(49). In the circumstances, the Commission considers that the tax incentive in the form of a 45 % tax credit cannot comply with the said sectoral rules. In this particular case, the 45 % tax credit does not meet the condition that it should not promote new production capacity so as not to exacerbate the overcapacity problems from which these sectors traditionally suffer. Therefore, where the recipient belongs to one of the abovementioned sectors, the Commission considers that, since it is not subject to the sectoral rules mentioned, the aid is incompatible with the common market and the derogation in Article 87(3)(c) of the Treaty on the promotion of certain activities does not apply.\n(92) As far as the period after 1 September 1998 is concerned, the Commission further takes the view that the aided investment may possibly fall within the scope of the multisectoral framework on regional aid for large investment projects (98/C 107/05)(50). All investment projects costing at least EUR 50 million (EUR 15 million in the case of the textile and clothing sector), with an aid intensity of at least 50 % of the regional aid ceiling and involving aid per job of at least EUR 40000 (EUR 30000 in the case of the textile and clothing sector), as well as investment projects for which the total aid is at least EUR 50 million, are subject to the conditions laid down in that framework. Each such investment project must be notified in advance, in accordance with Article 88(3) of the Treaty, to enable the Commission to determine the maximum aid intensity that is compatible with the common market. However, the tax aid in question is not subject either to prior notification in the case of the abovementioned large projects or to possible reduction in intensity following the Commission's assessment. The Commission therefore finds that the tax aid under examination is not compatible with the common market under the derogation in Article 87(3)(c) of the Treaty, since the derogation in Article 87(3)(a) does not apply in Álava.\n(93) Since the tax aid in question is granted irrespective of the economic and financial position of the recipient firms, the Commission considers that there is no way of ruling out the possibility that the recipient may be a firm in difficulty within the meaning of the Community guidelines on State aid for rescuing and restructuring firms in difficulty (1999/C 288/02)(51), despite the Spanish authorities' claim that the tax credit, as it has been designed, is unlikely to be applied to firms in difficulty. The Commission would point out that the grant of the tax aid in question is not subject to the conditions(52) laid down in those guidelines. As stated in point 20 of the abovementioned rescue and restructuring aid guidelines (1999/C 288/02), \"the Commission considers that aid for rescue and restructuring may contribute to the development of economic activities without adversely affecting trade to an extent contrary to the Community interest if the conditions set out in these guidelines are met\". If those conditions are not met, the aid is incompatible with the common market where it is intended for firms in difficulty. The Commission therefore finds that the tax aid in question, where granted to firms in difficulty, is not compatible with the common market under the derogation in Article 87(3)(c) of the Treaty on the promotion of certain activities.\nApplication of the other exceptions\n(94) The aid in question, which cannot qualify for the derogations in Article 87(3)(a) and (c) of the Treaty, cannot qualify either for other derogations in Article 87(2) and (3). It cannot be regarded as aid of a social nature under Article 87(2)(a); it is not intended to make good the damage caused by natural disasters or exceptional occurrences within the meaning of Article 87(2)(b). Furthermore, its object is not to promote the execution of an important project of common European interest, nor to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy of a Member State, as provided for in Article 87(3)(b). Finally, it is not intended to promote culture and heritage conservation within the meaning of Article 87(3)(d).\nSummary\n(95) The Commission finds that the State aid in question in the form of a 45 % tax credit does not qualify for the derogation in Article 87(3)(a) of the Treaty, since Álava is not eligible for assistance under that provision, or for the derogation in Article 87(3)(c) for \"aid to facilitate the development (...) of certain economic areas\", since it does not comply with the Community rules on regional aid. Neither does it qualify for the derogation in Article 87(3)(c) for \"aid to facilitate the development of certain economic activities\", since, on the one hand, it does not comply with the Community rules applicable to SMEs in this context and, on the other hand, as far as large firms are concerned, it does not relate to certain activities. It cannot be regarded as aid of a social nature under Article 87(2)(a); it is not intended to make good the damage caused by natural disasters or exceptional occurrences within the meaning of Article 87(2)(b). Furthermore, its object is not to promote the execution of an important project of common European interest, nor to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy of a Member State, as provided for in Article 87(3)(b). Nor does it qualify for the derogation in Article 87(3)(d) as its purpose is not to promote culture or heritage conservation. The aid is therefore incompatible with the common market.\n(96) Since any tax credit that is not used because it exceeds the final amount of tax payable may be carried over and used for several years following adoption of the decision granting the tax credit(53), there could still be some tax aid left to pay. However, this aid is unlawful and incompatible. The Spanish authorities should therefore cancel the payment of any balance from the 45 % tax credit which could still be due to certain recipients.\n(97) As regards incompatible aid already paid, it should be pointed out that, in accordance with the above arguments, the recipients may not rely on general principles of Community law such as legitimate expectations or legal certainty. Consequently, there is nothing to prevent the application of Article 14(1) of Regulation (EC) No 659/1999, according to which \"where negative decisions are taken in cases of unlawful aid, the Commission shall decide that the Member State concerned shall take all necessary measures to recover the aid from the beneficiary\". In this case, therefore, the Spanish authorities should take all necessary measures to recover the aid already paid in order to restore the economic situation which the recipient firms would be in without the unlawful grant of the aid. The aid should be recovered in accordance with the procedures and provisions of Spanish law and should include all interest due, calculated from the date the aid was granted until the date of actual repayment on the basis of the reference rate used at that date to calculate the net grant equivalent of regional aid in Spain(54).\n(98) This decision relates to the scheme and should be implemented immediately, including the recovery of any individual aid granted under that scheme. The Commission would also point out that, as usual, this Decision is without prejudice to whether individual aid may be regarded, in full or in part, as compatible with the common market on its own merits, either in a subsequent Commission decision or under exempting regulations.\n(99) Since the compatibility of the State aid in the form of tax credits granted to Daewoo Electronics Manufacturing España SA, Ramondín SA and Ramondín Cápsulas SA has already been assessed in various Commission decisions, this Decision does not refer to that aid.\nX. CONCLUSIONS\n(100) In view of the above, the Commission concludes that:\n- Spain has unlawfully put into effect, in Álava, the 45 % tax credit for investments, thereby infringing Article 88(3) of the Treaty,\n- the 45 % tax credit for investments is incompatible with the common market,\n- the Spanish authorities must cancel the payment of any balance of the tax credit which could still be due to certain recipients. As regards the incompatible aid already paid, the Spanish authorities must take all necessary measures to recover it, so as to restore the economic situation which the recipient firms would be in without the unlawful grant of the aid,\n- this Decision does not cover the tax credits granted to Daewoo Electronics Manufacturing España SA, Ramondín SA and Ramondín Cápsulas SA,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\nArticle 1\nThe State aid in the form of a 45 % tax credit for investments, which, in violation of Article 88(3) of the Treaty, has been unlawfully put into effect by Spain in Álava pursuant to Provincial Law No 22/1994 of 20 December 1994, the fifth additional provision of Provincial Law No 33/1995 of 20 December 1995, the sixth additional provision of Provincial Law No 31/1996 of 18 December 1996, as amended by point 2.11 of the derogating provision in Provincial Law No 24/1996 of 5 July 1996 on corporation tax, the eleventh additional provision of Provincial Law No 33/1997 of 19 December 1997 and the seventh additional provision of Provincial Law No 36/1998 of 17 December 1998, is incompatible with the common market.\nArticle 2\nSpain shall abolish the aid scheme referred to in Article 1, since it is continuing to produce effects.\nArticle 3\n1. Spain shall take all necessary measures to recover from the recipients the aid referred to in Article 1 which has been unlawfully made available to them.\nSpain shall cancel all payment of outstanding aid.\n2. Recovery shall be effected without delay in accordance with the procedures of national law, provided these allow the immediate and effective execution of this Decision. The sums to be recovered shall bear interest from the date on which they were available to the recipients until their actual recovery. Interest shall be calculated on the basis of the reference rate used for calculating the grant equivalent of regional aid.\nArticle 4\nSpain shall inform the Commission, within two months of the date of notification of this Decision, of the measures taken to comply with it.\nArticle 5\nThis Decision does not cover the tax credits granted under the scheme in question to Daewoo Electronics Manufacturing España SA, Ramondín SA and Ramondín Cápsulas SA.\nArticle 6\nThis Decision is addressed to the Kingdom of Spain.\nDone at Brussels, 11 July 2001.",

Member States shall adopt the measures defined in this Directive in respect of establishment or provision of services in their territories by natural persons and companies or firms covered by Title I of the General Programmes for the abolition of restrictions on freedom to supply services(7) and on freedom of establishment(8) (hereinafter called \"beneficiaries\") who wish to pursue the activities listed in Annex A.\n2. This Directive shall apply to the activities listed in Annex A which nationals of Member States wish to pursue in a host Member State in a self-employed or employed capacity.\nArticle 2\nMember States in which the taking-up or pursuit of any activity referred to in Annex A is subject to possession of certain qualifications shall ensure that any beneficiaries who apply therefor be provided, before they establish themselves or before they begin to provide services, with information as to the rules governing the occupation which they propose to pursue.\nTITLE II\nRecognition of formal qualifications awarded by another Member State\nArticle 3\n1. Without prejudice to Article 4, a Member State may not, on the grounds of inadequate qualifications, refuse to permit a national of another Member State to take up or pursue any of the activities listed in Part One of Annex A on the same conditions as apply to its own nationals, without having first compared the knowledge and skills certified by the diplomas, certificates or other evidence of formal qualifications obtained by the beneficiary with a view to pursuing the same activity elsewhere in the Community with those required under its own national rules. Where the comparative examination shows that the knowledge and skills certified by a diploma, certificate or other evidence of formal qualifications awarded by another Member State correspond to those required by the national rules, the host Member State cannot refuse the holder the right to pursue the activity in question. Where, however, the comparative examination shows a substantial difference, the host Member State shall give the beneficiary the opportunity to demonstrate that he has acquired the knowledge and skills which were lacking. In this case, the host Member State shall give the applicant the right to choose between an adaptation period and an aptitude test by analogy with Directives 89/48/EEC and 92/51/EEC.\nBy way of derogation from this rule, the host Member State may require an adaptation period or an aptitude test if the migrant envisages exercising professional activities in a self-employed capacity or as a manager of an undertaking which are covered by Part One of Annex A and which require the knowledge and the application of the specific national rules in force, provided that knowledge and application of those rules are required by the competent authorities of the host Member State for access to such activities by its own nationals.\nMember States shall endeavour to take into consideration the beneficiary's preference as between those alternatives.\n2. Applications for recognition within the meaning of paragraph 1 shall be examined within the shortest possible time, and the competent authority in the host Member State shall state its reasons when giving a decision, which shall be taken no later than four months from the date on which the application and comprehensive supporting documentation were submitted. There shall be a right to appeal under national law against a decision or against the absence of such decision.\nTITLE III\nRecognition of professional qualifications on the basis of professional experience acquired in another Member State\nArticle 4\nWhere, in a Member State, the taking-up or pursuit of any activity listed in Annex A is subject to possession of general, commercial or professional knowledge and ability, that Member State shall accept as sufficient evidence of such knowledge and ability the fact that the activity in question has been pursued in another Member State. Where the activity is mentioned in Part One of Annex A, it must have been pursued:\n1. in the case of the activities in List I:\n(a) for six consecutive years in either a self-employed capacity or as a manager of an undertaking; or\n(b) for three consecutive years in a self-employed capacity or as a manager of an undertaking where the beneficiary proves that he has received at least three years' prior training for the activity in question, attested by a nationally recognised certificate or regarded by a competent professional or trade body as fully satisfying its requirements; or\n(c) for three consecutive years in a self-employed capacity where the beneficiary proves that he has pursued the activity in question for at least five years in an employed capacity; or\n(d) for five consecutive years in a managerial capacity of which at least three years were spent in technical posts with responsibility for one or more departments of the undertaking where the beneficiary proves that he has received at least three years' prior training for the activity in question, attested by a nationally recognised certificate or regarded by a competent professional or trade body as fully satisfying its requirements.\nIn the cases referred to in (a) and (c), pursuit of the activity shall not have ceased more than ten years before the date on which the application under Article 8 is made;\n2. in the case of the activities in List II:\n(a) for six consecutive years in either a self-employed capacity or as a manager of an undertaking;

or\n(d) - for five consecutive years in an employed capacity where the beneficiary proves that he has received at least three years' prior training for the activity in question, attested by a nationally recognised certificate or regarded by a competent professional or trade body as fully satisfying its requirements, or\n- for six consecutive years in an employed capacity where the beneficiary proves that he has received at least two years' prior training for the activity in question, attested by a nationally recognised certificate or regarded by a competent professional or trade body as fully satisfying its requirements.\nIn the cases referred to in (a) and (c), pursuit of the activity shall not have ceased more than ten years before the date on which the application provided for in Article 8 is made;\n3. in the case of the activities in List III:\n(a) for six consecutive years in either a self-employed capacity or as a manager of an undertaking;

or\n(c) for three consecutive years in a self-employed capacity or as a manager of an undertaking where the beneficiary proves that he has received at least two years' prior training for the activity in question, attested by a nationally recognised certificate or regarded by a competent professional or trade body as fully satisfying its requirements; or\n(d) for two consecutive years in a self-employed capacity or as a manager of an undertaking where the beneficiary proves that he has pursued the activity in question for at least three years in an employed capacity; or\n(e) for three consecutive years in an employed capacity where the beneficiary proves that he has received at least two years' previous training for the activity in question, attested by a nationally recognised certificate or regarded by a competent professional or trade body as fully satisfying its requirements;\n5. in the case of the activities in List V(a) and (b):\n(a) for three years in a self-employed capacity or as a manager of an undertaking, provided that pursuit of the activity in question did not cease more than two years before the date on which the application provided for in Article 8 is made;\n(b) for three years in a self-employed capacity or as a manager of an undertaking, provided that pursuit of the activity in question did not cease more than two years before the date on which the application provided for in Article 8 is made, unless the host Member State permits its nationals to interrupt their pursuit of that activity for a longer period; or\n6. in the case of the activities in List VI:\n(a) for three consecutive years in either a self-employed capacity or as a manager of an undertaking; or\n(b) for two consecutive years in a self-employed capacity or as a manager of an undertaking where the beneficiary proves that he has received prior training for the activity in question, attested by a nationally recognised certificate or regarded by a competent professional or trade body as fully satisfying its requirements; or\n(c) for two consecutive years in a self-employed capacity or as a manager of an undertaking where the beneficiary proves that he has pursued the activity in question for at least three years in an employed capacity; or\n(d) for three consecutive years in an employed capacity where the beneficiary proves that he has received previous training for the activity in question, attested by a nationally recognised certificate or regarded by a competent professional or trade body as fully satisfying its requirements.\nIn the cases referred to in (a) and (c), pursuit of the activity shall not have ceased more than 10 years before the date on which the application provided for in Article 8 is made.\nArticle 5\nWhere a beneficiary holds a nationally recognised certificate obtained in a Member State attesting to knowledge of and ability in the activity in question equivalent to at least two or three years, as appropriate, of professional training, that certificate may be treated by the host Member State in the same way as a certificate attesting to training of the duration required by Article 4(1)(b) and (d), (2)(b) and (d), (3)(b) and (4)(b), (c) and (e).\nArticle 6\nWhere the duration of the training of the beneficiary is at least two years and less than three years, the requirements of Article 4 shall be satisfied if the duration of professional experience in a self-employed capacity or as a manager specified in Article 4(1)(b) and (d), (2)(b), first indent, (3)(b) and (4)(b) or in an employed capacity specified in Article 4(2)(d), first indent is extended in the same proportion to cover the difference in the duration of the training.\nArticle 7\nA person shall be regarded as having pursued an activity as a manager of an undertaking within the meaning of Article 4 if he has pursued such an activity in an undertaking in the occupational field in question:\n(a) as a manager of an undertaking or a manager of a branch of an undertaking; or\n(b) as a deputy to the proprietor or the manager of an undertaking where that post involves responsibility equivalent to that of the proprietor or manager represented; or\n(c) in a managerial post with duties of a commercial and/or technical nature and with responsibility for one or more departments of the undertaking.\nArticle 8\nProof that the conditions laid down in Article 4 are satisfied shall be established by a certificate concerning the nature and duration of the activity issued by the competent authority or body in the home Member State or in the Member State from where the beneficiary comes which the beneficiary must submit in support of his application for authorisation to pursue the activity or activities in question in the host Member State.\nTITLE IV\nRecognition of other professional qualifications obtained in another Member State\nArticle 9\n1. Where a host Member State requires its own nationals wishing to take up any activity referred to in Article 1(2) to furnish proof of good character and proof that they are not and have not previously been declared bankrupt, or proof of either of these, it shall accept as sufficient evidence, in respect of nationals of other Member States, the production of an extract from the \"judicial record\" or, failing this, of an equivalent document issued by a competent judicial or administrative authority in the home Member State or in the Member State from where the beneficiary comes showing that these requirements are satisfied.\n2. Where a host Member State imposes on its own nationals wishing to take up any activity referred to in Article 1(2) certain requirements as to good character and requires them to prove that they are not and have not previously been declared bankrupt and have not previously been the subject of professional or administrative disciplinary measures (for example, withdrawal of the right to hold certain offices, suspension from practice or striking-off), but proof cannot be obtained from the document referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, it shall accept as sufficient evidence in respect of nationals of other Member States a certificate issued by a competent judicial or administrative authority in the home Member State or in the Member State from where the beneficiary comes attesting that the requirements are satisfied. Such certificate shall relate to the specific facts regarded as relevant by the host Member State.\n3.

The declaration of no previous bankruptcy may also be made before a competent professional or trade body in that Member State.\n4. Where a host Member State requires proof of financial standing, it shall regard certificates issued by banks in the home Member State or in the Member State from where the beneficiary comes as equivalent to those issued in its own territory.\n5. Where a host Member State requires its own nationals wishing to take up or pursue any activity referred to in Article 1(2) to furnish proof that they are insured against the financial risks arising from their professional liability, it shall accept certificates issued by the insurance undertakings of other Member States as equivalent to those issued in its own territory. Such certificates shall state that the insurer has complied with the laws and regulations in force in the host Member State regarding the terms and extent of cover.\n6. At the time of their production, the documents referred to in paragraphs 1, 2, 3 and 5 may not date from more than three months after their date of issue.\nTITLE V\nProcedural provisions\nArticle 10\n1. Member States shall designate, within the period stipulated in Article 14, the authorities and bodies responsible for issuing the certificates referred to in Articles 8 and 9(1), (2) and (3) and shall communicate this information forthwith to the other Member States and to the Commission.\n2.

PROCEDURE\n(1)\nBy letter of 8 October 2004, Poland informed the Commission about measures granted in support of the restructuring of Huta Stalowa Wola SA (hereinafter referred to as ‘HSW’, ‘the beneficiary’ or ‘the company’), with a view to obtaining legal certainty that they had been granted before accession and were not applicable after accession, and that they did not therefore constitute new aid which could be examined by the Commission under Article 88 of the EC Treaty. In the event that the Commission were to find these measures to be new aid, Poland asked that they be approved as restructuring aid.\n(2)\nThe Commission requested Poland to provide further information by letters of 11 November 2004, 1 March 2005, 27 April 2005 and 26 July 2005, to which Poland replied, respectively, by letters of 31 January 2005, registered on 2 February 2005, of 4 April 2005, registered on 8 April 2005, of 7 June 2005, registered on 9 June 2005 and of 2 September 2005, registered on 6 September 2005.\n(3)\nIn the course of this exchange of information it emerged that some of the notified measures had been implemented in contravention of Article 88(3) of the EC Treaty.\n(4)\nBy letter of 23 November 2005, the Commission informed Poland that it had decided to initiate the procedure laid down in Article 88(2) of the EC Treaty in respect of those measures.\n(5)\nThe Commission’s decision to initiate the Article 88(2) procedure was published in the Official Journal of the European Union (1). The Commission invited interested parties to submit their comments on the measure.\n(6)\nPoland submitted its observations by letter of 7 March 2006, registered on 9 March 2006. No comments were received from third parties.\n(7)\nBy decision of 20 December 2006 the Commission concluded the formal investigation by declaring restructuring aid in favour of HSW compatible with the common market (‘decision of 20 December 2006’) (2). The Commission’s examination showed that some aid was granted before Poland’s accession to the EU (PLN 157 million or EUR 37,2 million (3), and some after accession (PLN 66 million or EUR 15,6 million).\n(8)\nThe Commission had taken the decision of 20 December 2006 on the basis of a restructuring plan of HSW dated February 2006 (the ‘February plan’) and submitted by Poland on 9 March 2006. After the decision of 20 December 2006 had been adopted, Poland notified by letter of 2 February 2007 (registered on 4 February 2007) an updated version of the plan dated November 2006 (‘November plan’). Poland argued that for internal administrative reasons it had been unable to notify the Commission of the modified plan earlier (4).\n(9)\nThe Commission requested additional information about the modifications of the February plan by letters of 29 March 2007 and 21 May 2007. The Polish authorities replied respectively by letters of 30 April 2007, registered on that day, and 5 June 2007, registered on that day. On 7 June 2007 a meeting was held between the Polish authorities, the Commission services and HSW’s management. Following the meeting the Commission, by letter of 22 June 2007, requested further information. Poland replied by letter of 13 July 2007, registered on that day.\n(10)\nOn 10 October 2007, the Commission decided to initiate a formal investigation procedure on the basis of Article 88(2) of the EC Treaty owing to doubts as to whether the modified restructuring plan fulfilled all the conditions set out in the Community Guidelines on State aid for rescuing and restructuring firms in difficulty (‘the 2004 Guidelines’) (5). In this decision the Commission also mentioned the possibility of revoking the decision of 20 December 2006 pursuant to Article 9 of Council Regulation (EC) No 659/1999 (6).\n(11)\nThe Commission’s decision to initiate an investigation procedure under Article 88(2) of the EC Treaty was published in the Official Journal of the European Union (7). The Commission invited interested parties to submit their comments on the measure.\n(12)\nAfter being granted an extension of the deadline for the submission of its comments (requests of 30 October 2007 and 6 December 2007, to which the Commission replied in letters of 20 November 2007 and 19 December 2007 respectively), Poland submitted its comments by letter of 15 January 2008, registered on that day. The Commission has also received comments from 13 third parties, including the beneficiary. Comments were submitted by local authorities: the President of Stalowa Wola city by letter of 11 November 2008, the Starosta Powiatu Stalowa Wola by letter of 14 January 2008 and the Voivod of Podkarpackie Region by letter of 15 January 2008. The following suppliers of HSW submitted comments: Clak Hurtownia Artykołow Przemysłowych H. Adamski, J. Lach T. Knie s.j. by letter of 10 January 2008, Kwadrat Sp. z o.o. by letter of 10 January 2008, Odlewnia Staliwa ‘Labedy’ Sp. z o.o by letter of 10 January 2008, Fabryka Maszyn Lubaczow Sp. z o.o. by letter of 11 January 2008 and SigmaKalon Cieszyn SA by letter of 11 January 2008. The following banks cooperating with HSW submitted comments: Bank Pekao SA by letter of 11 January 2008 and BRE Bank S.A by letter of 14 January 2008. Finally comments were submitted by ENESTA Sp. z o.o. (energy supplier) by letter of 11 January 2008 and by the Social Insurance Fund by letter of 21 January 2008. The beneficiary submitted comments by letter of 14 January 2008.\n(13)\nThe Commission forwarded the comments received from third parties to Poland by letter of 28 January 2008.\n(14)\nOn 9 and 14 April 2008, the Polish authorities sent letters to Commissioner Neelie Kroes, to which the Commissioner replied on 28 April 2008, requesting additional information. Those letters were answered by letters of the Polish authorities dated 4 July 2008, registered on 9 July 2008.\n(15)\nBy letter of 7 November 2008, registered on that day, Poland submitted additional information. On 1 December 2008, the Commission sent a request for information to which Poland replied by letter of 22 December 2008, registered on that day.\n2. DESCRIPTION\n2.1. The Company\n(16)\nHSW, the beneficiary of the aid and the parent company of the HSW group, is based in Stalowa Wola, which is situated in the Podkarpackie voivodship. This region is eligible for aid under Article 87(3)(a) of the EC Treaty. In February 2006, the group included eight companies in which HSW held at least 51 % of shares (thereby controlling these companies) and 10 in which it held less than 51 %. Companies belonging to the HSW capital group supply each other with materials and services. After the parent company, the companies with the highest share capital in the group are HSW-Zakład Zespołów Napędowych Sp. z o.o and HSW-Zakład Zespołów Mechanicznych Sp. z o.o. Sales to companies belonging to the capital group account for 20-30 % of HSW’s total sales.\n(17)\nHSW was created in 1937 and initially produced cannon and high alloy steel. Unlike its subsidiary HSW - Zakład Metalurgiczny, it is not a steel producer. In 1991 it became a joint-stock company. The State still owns 76 % of the shares, 9 % belong to employees, and the remaining public and private shareholders hold no more than 5 % each. HSW manufactures construction machinery and military equipment (cannon, howitzers etc.).\n(18)\nIn 2005 HSW had about 2 400 employees, down from 3 173 in 2002.\n(19)\nOne of the subsidiaries of HSW is the distribution company Dressta Sp. z o.o. (hereafter ‘Dressta’). Since September 2006, the latter has been fully controlled by HSW. Previously, however, 51 % of the shares of Dressta were owned by Komatsu American International Company USA (hereinafter referred to as KAIC), a competitor of HSW. In 1995 HSW transferred licenses and assets relating to its sales on foreign markets to Dressta for a period of 12 years.\n2.2. Difficulties of the Company\n(20)\nThe beneficiary’s difficulties began in 2002, when its turnover dropped from PLN 494,9 million (EUR 117,3 million) in 2000 to PLN 352,6 million (EUR 83,5 million), a fall of 29 %. Its exports fell from PLN 505 million (EUR 119,7 million) to PLN 279 million (EUR 66,1 million). The fall in turnover on foreign markets was primarily attributable to the recession and to the fact that Dressta, under the influence of its principal shareholder (a major competitor of HSW), significantly reduced its sales of HSW’s products on the North American market.\n(21)\nIn 2002 the beneficiary made an operating loss of PLN 33,9 million (EUR 8,03 million), mostly due to underuse of its production capacity. As most of the company’s sales on foreign markets were realised in US dollars and most of its costs incurred in Polish zlotys, the rise in value of the latter currency adversely affected the beneficiary’s sales and profitability.\n(22)\nHSW was heavily indebted. Its debt in the period 2000-2002 averaged PLN 169,1 million (EUR 40,1 million).\n(23)\nThe company was also operating at a loss. The loss on sales rose from PLN 6,4 million (EUR 1,52 million) in 2000 to PLN 33,9 million (EUR 8,03 million) in 2002.\n(24)\nThe HSW group made net losses of PLN 137,7 million (EUR 32,6 million) in 2002 and PLN 123,9 million (EUR 29,4 million) in 2003.\n2.3. The restructuring\n(25)\nIn 2002 the beneficiary sought to address these difficulties by drawing up a restructuring plan for the period 2003-07. This plan was amended in February 2006 (‘February Plan’). The Commission delivered its decision of 20 December 2006 on the basis of that plan. The plan was updated in November 2007 (‘November Plan’), as a result of which the Commission decided to reinitiate the procedure.\n2.3.1. February plan\n(26)\nOne of the principal measures included in the February plan was the modification of the organisational structure of the beneficiary. The main idea of HSW’s restructuring process was to separate that part of the company directly involved in production from the assets to be restructured. An independent company, HSW-Trading Sp. z o.o. (hereafter ‘HSW-Trading’), was therefore created by HSW’s majority shareholder - the State Treasury. The State Treasury gave HSW-Trading a capital injection of PLN 40 million (EUR 9,48 million), which was notified by Poland among the measures granted to HSW (item 16 in Table 2 below).\n(27)\nWhile HSW-Trading was responsible for production and sales of industrial machinery, logistics, quality management and the supply of materials for the production of machinery, HSW retained research and development activities, the financing of productive assets, strategic marketing, sales of spare parts, repairs, and production and sales of military equipment. HSW was also responsible for the organisational restructuring. For the purpose of exercising its activities, HSW-Trading leased assets directly related to production from HSW. The necessary workforce was also temporarily transferred to HSW-Trading.\n(28)\nThis division was to last from 2004 to 2006, i.e. throughout the restructuring of HSW. HSW-Trading was to merge with HSW again at the end of 2006.\n(29)\nThe February plan provided for a major restructuring of employment. On completion of restructuring in 2007 HSW would employ 2 100 workers, down from 3 173 employees at the end of 2002.\n(30)\nIn order to enable the beneficiary to reach new markets, the organisation of the distribution network for construction machinery and spare parts on the world market was also to be restructured.\n(31)\nThe restructuring of HSW was also to include the sale of subsidiaries and the privatisation of departments operating in the service sector. By 2006 HSW had sold HSW - Zakład Kuźnia Matrycowa Sp. z o.o for PLN 38 million (EUR 9,0 million) and HSW - Zaklad Metalurgiczny (HSW-Walcownia Blach Sp. z o.o. and HSW-Huta Stali Jakosciowych). HSW generated a revenue of PLN 112,2 million (EUR 26,6 million) from this privatisation. The sale of two subsidiaries, HSW - Zakład Spreżynownia and HSW - Tlenownia, was to be finalised in 2006.\n(32)\nThe restructuring of assets involved reducing production capacity from 1 500 construction machines a year to 1 200 a year. HSW’s assets were considered to exceed its needs. As HSW planned to focus on the production of construction machinery, a significant share of its assets were to be sold. The assets sold between January 2003 and December 2005 generated revenue of PLN 52,1 million (EUR 12,3 million), which far exceeded the forecast PLN 10,3 million (EUR 2,4 million). The following assets were sold: some 248,4 ha of land (including approximately 153 ha of woodland); 76 000 m2 of real estate and 94 items of machinery and equipment.\n(33)\nThe overall restructuring costs, including restructuring costs before accession, totalled PLN 450,3 million (EUR 106,7 million) and consisted mainly of the restructuring of civil-law liabilities (PLN 95,6 million and PLN 113,2 million respectively), the cost of organising the supply and distribution system (PLN 151,2 million), the cost of ensuring continuity of supply (PLN 40,0 million) and modernisation (PLN 30,5 million).\n2.3.2. November plan\n(34)\nBy letter of 2 February 2007 Poland informed the Commission of changes made to the restructuring plan in November 2006. Poland feels that these changes will not alter the amount of State aid and are in line with point 52 of the 2004 Guidelines.\n(35)\nThe principal change to the February plan concerned the financing of restructuring: rather than HSW reimbursing two loans granted to it before accession in 2003 and 2004 by the State-owned Industrial Development Agency (hereafter ‘the ARP’) and the interest on these loans (8), the ARP would swap the nominal value of the debt for equity and so become a shareholder of HSW. Other changes concern postponements of organisational restructuring.\n(36)\nAccording to Poland, the debt-to-equity swap will allow HSW to gather the resources needed to function properly on the market and for future necessary investments. Poland has indicated that out of PLN 96,2 million (the original two loans totalling PLN 75 million plus PLN 21,2 million in accrued interest) (9):\n-\nPLN [0-50] (10) million will be used for modernisation of equipment and for additional investments, which according to Poland, are necessary for the restoration of viability,\n-\nPLN [0-50] million is necessary for the additional costs related to the postponed merger between HSW and HSW-Trading, which has increased the employment restructuring costs,\n-\nPLN [50-100] million will be used to finance additional accumulation of stock, the increase in receivables due to the extension of payment deadlines for invoices to customers and the shortening of deadlines for payments to suppliers,\n-\nPLN [0-10] million will be used to finance additional commercial credits.\n(37)\nPoland claims that HSW needs additional cash-flow (the above-mentioned PLN [0-100] million) because the market for construction machinery has become more competitive: HSW’s competitors are giving their clients longer invoice payment deadlines and agreeing shorter deadlines for paying their suppliers.\n(38)\nThe overall restructuring costs of the November plan, including restructuring costs prior to accession, total PLN 456,9 million (EUR 108,3 million) and are composed of the items summarised in Table 1:\nTable 1\nSummary of the restructuring costs as envisaged in the November Plan\n(in PLN thousands)\nRestructuring measure\nCosts\nRestructuring of civil-law liabilities\n95 648\nRestructuring of public-law liabilities\n113 213\nOrganisation of the supply and distribution system\n158 741\nContinuity of supply of material, spare parts and components\n40 000\nProduct restructuring\n1 666\nAsset restructuring\n871\nEmployment restructuring\n4 199\nOrganisational restructuring\n2 013\nModernisation of production capacity\n30 524\nTotal\n456 878\n3. DECISION TO INITIATE THE PROCEDURE UNDER ARTICLE 88(2) OF THE EC TREATY\n(39)\nOn 23 November 2005 the Commission decided to initiate a formal investigation procedure. By decision of 20 December 2006, the Commission authorised the restructuring aid for HSW on the basis of the company’s restructuring plan of February 2006. On 10 October 2007 the Commission decided to initiate a formal investigation procedure following the notification of the November plan, which included additional support for HSW. In this decision the Commission envisaged the possibility of revoking the decision of 20 December 2006, as that decision was based on incorrect information.\n3.1. Decision of 23 November 2005 initiating the investigation procedure\n(40)\nIn its decision of 23 November 2005, the Commission considered that aid measures totalling PLN 145,8 million had been granted to HSW before Poland’s accession to the EU; measures totalling PLN 27,9 million had been granted after accession without the Commission’s approval and measures totalling PLN 43,4 million had not yet been granted and thus constituted new State aid.\n(41)\nThe Commission decided to initiate a formal investigation procedure on two grounds.\n(42)\nFirst, the Commission doubted whether the restructuring aid was compatible with the common market.\n(43)\nIn this respect, the Commission doubted whether the restructuring plan was capable of restoring the long-term viability of the beneficiary, since it seemed to focus on debt-servicing and covering operating costs.\n(44)\nThe Commission also had doubts about the implementation of sufficient compensatory measures. While Poland claimed that HSW planned to reduce production capacity by 20 %, the plan provided for an increase in the use of production capacity from 27,7 % in 2002 to 66 % in 2007. The Commission had doubts about the net effect of this operation.\n(45)\nThe Commission also doubted whether the aid was limited to the minimum necessary and whether the beneficiary’s own contribution was significant, as Poland had not drawn a clear distinction between what it considered an own contribution to restructuring and what was financing from State aid.\n(46)\nThe Commission also doubted whether the ‘one time, last time’ principle was respected, as a subsidiary of HSW, HSW-Zakład Zespołów Mechanicznych, had received restructuring aid for 2003-07 before Poland had joined the European Union. It was therefore necessary to demonstrate that this aid had had no spillover effects on the parent company, HSW. Poland was also asked to assure the Commission that the restructuring aid to HSW, if allowed, would have no spillover effects on HSW - Zakład Zespołów Mechanicznych.\n(47)\nThe second ground for initiating the formal investigation procedure was that the Commission doubted whether there was sufficient separation between subsidised special military production (cannon) and civil production of construction machinery. Poland had assured the Commission in letters of 7 June 2005 and 2 September 2005 that cross-subsidisation was excluded, and the Commission noted that the ratio of aid for military production to total aid was small compared to the ratio of military production to total production. The Commission nevertheless requested more detailed explanations on the separation of accounts.\n3.2. Decision of 10 October 2007 re-initiating the investigation procedure\n(48)\nThe Commission initiated the formal investigation procedure on four grounds.\n(49)\nFirst, the Commission had doubts as to whether the November plan was capable of restoring the long-term viability of HSW, as it seemed that the company was in need of additional cash-flow.\n(50)\nSecond, the Commission had doubts as to whether the aid was limited to the minimum necessary, as the use of surplus cash-flow generated by the debt-to-equity swap had not been sufficiently explained by the Polish authorities.\n(51)\nThird, the Commission wondered whether the aid amount would not increase as a consequence of the swap.\n(52)\nFinally, in addition to its doubts about the increase in the aid amount, the Commission doubted whether the effect of the aid granted to HSW remained unchanged and did not therefore unduly distort competition. In other words, the Commission had doubts as to whether the compensatory measures were sufficient, since, according to point 40 of the 2004 Guidelines, compensatory measures must be in proportion to the distortive effects of the aid.\n(53)\nThe Commission decided to re-initiate the investigation procedure with a view to possibly revoking the decision of 20 December 2006.\n4. COMMENTS OF THIRD PARTIES\n(54)\nThe Commission had received no comments from third parties as regards the formal investigation procedure initiated on 23 November 2005.\n(55)\nIn response to the reopening of the formal investigation procedure, the Commission received comments from 13 third parties including the beneficiary. The comments received stressed confidence in the success of the restructuring of HSW (public and private creditors, HSW’s suppliers) and emphasised the company’s importance for the entire region (the beneficiary and the local granting authorities).\n5. COMMENTS FROM POLAND\n5.1. Comments on the decision of 23 November 2005\n(56)\nFirst, the Polish authorities commented on the Commission’s assessment of which measures had been granted before accession and which constituted unlawful or new aid. The Polish authorities maintained that aid granted on the basis of the amended Act of 30 October 2002 on State aid for enterprises of special significance for the labour market (see Table 3 below) had not been granted before accession, contesting the view taken by the Commission in the decision initiating the formal investigation procedure. The Polish authorities repeated their earlier submission that the decisive moment for granting State aid under this Act occurs when the beneficiary’s public creditors give their consent (the ‘administrative commitments’), not when the President of the ARP takes a restructuring decision. Since the public creditors of HSW whose receivables were restructured had given their consent vis-à-vis HSW prior to accession, the Polish authorities argue that this aid was granted before accession and the Commission is not therefore competent to assess its compatibility with the common market.\n(57)\nSecond, the Polish authorities identified two modifications to the aid as originally notified by letter of 8 October 2004. The first and most important modification was that part of the planned State aid (a total of PLN 43,5 million) had been partially withdrawn and replaced by two measures, which were claimed not to constitute State aid. The second modification was factual in nature, namely specifying the amounts of aid under three measures granted to HSW before accession. Tables 2 to 5 list all the measures granted and to be granted to HSW over the restructuring period, as corrected in the light of the Polish authorities’ clarifications.\n(58)\nThe Polish authorities also claimed that the planned deferral and payment in instalments of public-law liabilities of PLN 22,1 million (EUR 5,2 million) (item 28 in Table 4) should be treated as a de minimis measure. The methodology used by the Polish authority to calculate the aid amount compares the interest rate applied to the deferral with the Commission reference rate. The Polish authorities concluded that a measure is free of aid whenever the applied interest rate is higher than the reference rate. This, according to the Polish authorities, is the case of the deferral of liabilities to the Social Insurance Fund, which amount to PLN 16,4 million (item 29 in Table 4).\n(59)\nThird, regarding the viability of the company, the Polish authorities claimed that the organisational restructuring had proved successful, as HSW had regained control of Dressta and would therefore be able to expand on the profitable North American market.\n(60)\nWith regard to the requirement to limit distortions of competition, the Polish authorities maintained that the reduction in capacity from 1 500 to 1 200 machines was a valid compensatory measure. Moreover, they also considered the sale of HSW’s subsidiaries to be a compensatory measure.\n(61)\nAs regards the limitation of the aid to the minimum necessary, the Polish authorities provided a series of details on the amounts they considered to be an own contribution.\n(62)\nTo conclude, the Polish authorities claim in their observations that no State aid has been granted after accession or is planned. In the event that the Commission were to conclude otherwise, they provide additional elements to support the conclusion that the State aid is compatible with the common market.\n(63)\nWith regard to the Commission’s doubts concerning separation between the military and civil production of HSW, the Polish authorities assured the Commission that the current system of cost accounting allowed for a clear separation of the costs of these two activities.\n5.2. Comments on the decision of 10 October 2007\n(64)\nThe Polish authorities began by re-explaining why the changes in the restructuring plan had been notified so late, putting the blame on lengthy internal procedures.\n(65)\nSecond, Poland emphasised that the scope of the investigation procedure initiated should encompass only the change to the restructuring plan on the basis of point 52 of the 2004 Guidelines and argued that the Commission should not take steps under Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 659/1999 to revoke the decision of 20 December 2006. Poland invoked the principle of legal certainty in this respect.\n(66)\nThird, Poland argued that the debt-to-equity swap did not increase the overall aid amount approved.\n(67)\nFourth, the Polish authorities claimed that the aid equivalent of the ARP loans which had been approved by the Commission in its decision of 20 December 2006 was too high, having been equated to the nominal value of those loans (even though Poland admitted that that it had not previously questioned this approach). Hence, even if the Commission were to decide that the debt-to-equity swap would increase the aid by the amount of the ARP loans, the aid amount should not exceed the nominal value of the loans already approved in the decision of 20 December 2006.\n(68)\nThe Polish authorities explained that the company had paid PLN 22,9 million in interest on the ARP loans prior to the swap. The remaining interest that HSW would have to pay if there were no debt-to-equity swap would therefore amount to PLN 21,2 million.\n(69)\nFurthermore, Poland claimed that the debt-to-equity swap met the market-economy creditor test and did not constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) of the EC Treaty. Poland claimed that the ARP had taken into account the fact that HSW was becoming profitable and had assumed that the value of the acquired shares would increase in time.\n(70)\nIn the remaining part of their submission, the Polish authorities argued that even if the Commission were to conclude that the restructuring plan had been modified significantly, the overall new restructuring package should be deemed compatible with the 2004 Guidelines and the modification should be approved pursuant to point 52 thereof.\n(71)\nPoland emphasised that the restructuring was, save for a few minor changes, being implemented in accordance with the February plan and that the criteria of viability, own contribution and avoidance of undue distortions of competition were respected.\n5.2.1. Restoration of viability\n(72)\nFirst, regarding the restoration of long-term viability, the Polish authorities stressed that the company had increased its production and focused on the more profitable sale of heavy machinery (in particular large bulldozers and pipelayers). The company had doubled efficiency in terms of revenue per employee (from PLN 111 000 per employee in 2002 to PLN 222 000 per employee in 2007).\n(73)\nMoreover, despite its exposure to exchange-rate risks HSW had achieved higher profitability indicators than envisaged in the February plan.\n(74)\nMoreover, all liquidity and solvency indicators were higher than originally forecast. Poland also emphasised that the company was now taking advantage of private financing, proving that the market believed in the viability and solvency of the company.\n(75)\nLastly, Poland stressed the fact that HSW had become more efficient in reducing exposure to exchange-rate risks, as it now sought to purchase materials in the same currency as that in which its sales were recorded in the accounts.\n5.2.2. Own contribution to the restructuring\n(76)\nSecond, Poland claimed that the restructuring costs had risen to PLN 469,1 million (11), mainly owing to delays in organisational restructuring. However, as the company had managed to sell additional assets since the decision of 20 December 2006 was taken, its own contribution to the restructuring remained above 50 % (at 53,9 %).\n(77)\nAccording to the Polish authorities, the own contribution consisted of revenue from the sale of fixed assets amounting to PLN 61,4 million, revenue from the sale of subsidiaries amounting to PLN 126,4 million, debt purchases on the market amounting to PLN 61,6 million and cancellation of civil-law liabilities amounting to PLN 3,5 million.\n5.2.3. Avoidance of undue distortion of competition\n(78)\nThird, Poland claimed that the amount of aid had not increased, so there was no need for more extensive compensatory measures under point 52(b) of the 2004 Guidelines. Poland believes that the additional cash-flow generated by the debt-to-equity swap is being used by the company solely to maintain its position on the market. According to the Polish authorities, the company cannot even achieve a leading position on the domestic market, occupying […] and […] place depending on the product sold (12). According to Poland, the company’s share of the world market does not exceed [0-5] %.\n(79)\nIn addition, Poland stressed the importance of the company for the entire region.\n(80)\nThe Polish government gave the Commission assurances concerning the planned privatisation, giving the end of 2009 as the target date for completion of the privatisation procedure.\n6. THE AID MEASURES\n(81)\nThe granting authorities are the Treasury, the Ministry of Science and Information Technology, the tax authorities, local authorities, the Social Insurance Fund (ZUS), the State Fund for the Rehabilitation of the Disabled (PFRON), Treasury offices and the Industrial Development Agency (the ARP).\n(82)\nPoland claims that some of the measures granted for HSW were connected with the protection of essential interests of national security. These measures totalled approximately PLN 19 million (EUR 4,5 million), granted before and after Poland’s accession to the European Union. Invoking Article 296 of the EC Treaty, Poland claims that the provisions of the EC Treaty do not preclude Member States from taking measures they consider necessary to protect the essential interests of their security.\n(83)\nThe most significant measures granted before accession to the non-military part of HSW were two loans by the ARP, which together amounted to PLN 75 million (EUR 17,8 million). Another important measure is the capital injection by the State Treasury of PLN 40 million (EUR 9,5 million) for the subsidiary HSW - Trading Sp. z o.o.\n(84)\nPLN 27,9 million (EUR 6,6 million) in the form of a debt write-off was granted on the basis of the amended Act of 30 October 2002 on State aid for enterprises of special significance for the labour market (see Table 3 below). Restructuring under this legislation was supervised by the President of the ARP and based on a restructuring decision within the meaning of Articles 10(1)(4) and 19 of this Act (hereafter ‘the restructuring decision’). Such a restructuring decision, approving a restructuring plan of HSW in the form it took at that time and allowing restructuring of public-law liabilities, was issued on 29 April 2005 and amended on 17 June 2005.\n(85)\nThe principal change in the November plan consisted of allowing the debt-to-equity swap: rather than HSW reimbursing two loans granted to it before accession in 2003 and 2004 by the ARP (see Table 2, items 8 and 15) and the interest on these loans, the ARP decided to swap the nominal value of the debt for equity (items 30 and 31 in Table 4). As a result HSW, rather than having to reimburse PLN 97,1 million (the original two loans totalling PLN 75 million plus PLN 22,1 million in non-reimbursed interest), issued shares worth PLN 75 million which were acquired by the ARP (according to Poland the swap was implemented on 2 July 2007).\n(86)\nThe different State aid measures for HSW notified to the Commission and corrected in the light of additional information provided by Poland are presented in the following Tables.\nTable 2\nAid granted before 30 April 2004\n(in PLN thousands)\nNo\nStated date of agreement or decision\nGranting authority\nForm of aid\nNominal amount\nAid amount\n1.\n2003-12-12\nTreasury Office in Stalowa Wola\nWrite-off of VAT for September 2002\n1 047,5\n1 047,5\n2.\n2003-9-15\nTreasury Office in Stalowa Wola\nArrangement of instalment payments of VAT for December 2002\n4 769,8\n155,0\n3.\n2003-9-15\nTreasury Office in Stalowa Wola\nArrangement of instalment payments of VAT for March 2003\n1 771,8\n52,2\n4.\n2003-9-15\nTreasury Office in Stalowa Wola\nArrangement of instalment payments of VAT for May 2003\n2 175,2\n77,4\n5.\n2003-9-15\nTreasury Office in Stalowa Wola\nArrangement of instalment payments of PIT for March 2003\n623,3\n16,0\n6.\n2003-9-15\nTreasury Office in Stalowa Wola\nArrangement of instalment payments of PIT for May 2003\n463,4\n5,0\n7.\n2003-2-4\nSocial Insurance Institution (ZUS).

Competence of the Commission\n(87)\nAs some of the events relevant for the present case took place before Poland’s accession to the European Union on 1 May 2004, the Commission must first determine whether it is competent to act with regard to the measures in question.\n(88)\nMeasures that were put into effect before accession and are not applicable after accession cannot be examined by the Commission either under the interim mechanism procedure, governed by Annex IV, paragraph 3 of the Treaty of Accession of the Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia to the European Union, or under the procedures laid down in Article 88 of the EC Treaty. Neither the Accession Treaty nor the EC Treaty requires or empowers the Commission to review these measures.\n(89)\nHowever, measures put into effect after accession constitute new aid and fall within the competence of the Commission under the procedure laid down in Article 88 of the EC Treaty. The criterion determining the moment at which a certain measure was put into effect is the legally binding act by which the competent national authorities undertake to grant aid (18).\n(90)\nIndividual aid granted prior to accession is considered inapplicable after accession if the exact amount of the State’s financial exposure through that aid measure was known when the aid was granted.\n(91)\nOn the basis of the information provided by the Polish authorities, the Commission has been able to determine that the measures listed in Table 2 above were granted before accession and are not applicable thereafter. The Commission is not therefore competent to assess their compatibility with the common market. However, they have to be taken into account for determining the compatibility of aid measures granted or to be granted after accession. They amount to PLN 147 million (EUR 35 million) (19).\n(92)\nWith regard to the measures granted on the basis of the amended Act of 30 October 2002 on State aid for enterprises of special significance for the labour market, which are listed in Table 3, the Commission’s doubts as to the point in time at which they were granted have not been allayed. The Polish authorities have not provided new arguments in this respect in their comments on the decision to initiate the formal investigation procedure. The consent of the individual granting authorities to restructure their claims under this legislation is necessary but not sufficient for such restructuring to take place. The decisive element of the procedure under this Act is the restructuring decision. The President of the ARP issued the restructuring decision on 29 April 2005 and the Commission therefore considers that these measures were granted after accession. The Commission is therefore competent to assess their compatibility with the common market. As these measures were granted in contravention of the standstill clause in Article 88(3) of the EC Treaty, they constitute unlawful aid amounting to PLN 27,897 million (EUR 6,61 million).\n(93)\nLastly, if the measures listed in Table 4 constitute State aid, the Commission is competent to assess their compatibility with the common market, as they were clearly granted after accession.\n7.2. Justification of the revocation\n(94)\nArticle 9 of Regulation (EC) No 659/1999 provides that ‘the Commission may revoke a decision […] after having given the Member State concerned the opportunity to submit its comments, where the decision was based on incorrect information provided during the procedure which was a determining factor for the decision. Before revoking a decision and taking a new decision, the Commission shall open the formal investigation procedure pursuant to Article 4(4).’\n(95)\nAs already mentioned, the decision of 20 December 2006 was based on incorrect information, namely the restructuring plan of February 2006, which was no longer valid at the time when the Commission took that decision. The Polish authorities did not submit the updated version of the restructuring plan while the investigation procedure initiated in November 2005 was still under way, even though the plan had already been approved by the relevant bodies of HSW. The restructuring plan is the most important source of information for the Commission to assess the compatibility of restructuring aid. Hence, though the February plan had not been a false source of information, it became one after the November plan was adopted. The February plan, on which the Commission based the decision of 20 December 2006, was therefore an incorrect source of information at the time the Commission adopted that decision.\n(96)\nThe Commission therefore considers that the decision of 20 December 2006 was based on incorrect information such that its reasoning has to be modified and that decision should thus be revoked pursuant to Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 659/1999.\n7.3. State aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) of the EC Treaty\n(97)\nArticle 87(1) of the EC Treaty provides that any aid granted by a Member State or through State resources in any form whatsoever which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods and affects trade between Member States is incompatible with the common market.\n(98)\nThe Polish authorities have not contested that the measures listed in Tables 2 and 3 constitute State aid.\n7.3.1. February plan\n(99)\nThe Polish authorities submit that the aid in the form of the deferral of the payment of HSW’s tax and social security liabilities (measures 28 and 29 in Table 4) does not constitute State aid, as it is de minimis or the aid element is equal to zero. The Polish authorities base this argument on the calculation of the aid element of the measures.\n(100)\nThe Commission cannot subscribe to the method of calculation used by the Polish authorities. These measures are extended to a company in financial difficulties. The risk of debt rescheduling in favour of HSW is higher than for healthy companies, which should be reflected in the interest charged. The reference rate cannot therefore be applied as the benchmark. The calculation method whereby the actual interest rate charged is compared with the reference rate is not appropriate in the present case, so the Commission cannot accept Poland’s argument.\n(101)\nIt is established Commission practice (20) that the aid element in the case of firms in difficulty may not exceed the nominal amount. The aid measures in the form of deferrals listed in Table 4 total PLN 38,480 million (EUR 9,12 million).\n(102)\nThe Commission concludes that the measures listed in Table 3 and the deferrals listed in Table 4 as measures 28 and 29 are financed from State resources. They favour an individual undertaking by conferring on it an advantage not available to it on the market. HSW is active in the production of construction machinery, which is sold within the EC under conditions of intensive competition between operators from different Member States. These measures therefore constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) of the EC Treaty.\n7.3.2. November plan\n(103)\nIn the decision of 20 December 2006, the two loans (21) whose conversion to equity is investigated here were considered to be State aid granted before accession. The aid amount was calculated at 100 % of the nominal value of the loans. The Polish authorities did not question that approach until the Commission decision of 10 October 2007.\n(104)\nThe notified debt-to-equity swap consists of a capital injection by the ARP. It therefore involves State resources. It confers an advantage on the company because, as a company in difficulties, HSW would not have obtained that financing on those conditions on the market. As mentioned above, the Polish authorities admit that the beneficiary is better off thanks to the swap.\n(105)\nAs regards the Polish authorities’ suggestion that the debt-to-equity swap met the market-economy creditor test, the Commission notes that HSW was at that time in the process of restructuring and its improved situation at the time of the debt-to-equity swap resulted from earlier State aid. The Commission therefore concludes, on the basis of established practice and case law (22), that the swap does not pass the market-economy creditor test.\n(106)\nThe debt-to-equity swap, which was granted after accession, therefore constitutes State aid, which has not been contested by the Polish authorities.\n(107)\nAll the remaining measures presented in the decisions initiating the formal procedure constitute State aid, which has not been contested by the Polish authorities.\n7.4. Compatibility of the aid: derogation under Article 87(3) of the EC Treaty\n(108)\nThe exemptions in Article 87(2) of the EC Treaty do not apply to the present case. As for the exemptions under Article 87(3) of the EC Treaty, since the primary objective of the aid concerns the restoration of the long-term viability of an undertaking in difficulty, only the exemption of Article 87(3)(c) of the EC Treaty, which allows the Commission to authorise State aid granted to promote the development of certain economic activities where such aid does not adversely affect trading conditions to an extent contrary to the common interest, can be applied.\n7.4.1. Applicable legal basis\n(109)\nAs the Commission is revoking the decision of 20 December 2006 pursuant to Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 659/1999 and replacing it with this decision, the compatibility of the whole restructuring process has to be verified again.\n(110)\nThe Commission will assess the measures constituting new aid and the full restructuring plan (including the February 2006 and November 2006 plans) in accordance with the applicable rescue and restructuring guidelines. The current Community Guidelines on State aid for rescuing and restructuring firms in difficulty (23) entered into force on 10 October 2004. The previous 1999 rescue and restructuring Guidelines (24) (‘1999 Guidelines’) apply to measures whose notification was registered before this date. According to point 104 of the 2004 Guidelines, the Commission will examine the compatibility with the common market of any rescue and restructuring aid granted without its authorisation and therefore in breach of Article 88(3) of the Treaty on the basis of those Guidelines if some or all of the aid is granted after 1 October 2004, the date of their publication in the Official Journal.\n(111)\nIn the present case, many of the measures were notified on 8 October 2004 (two days before the entry into force of the 2004 Guidelines). However the Commission was also informed by Poland in its letter dated 7 March 2006 about additional measures granted to HSW in breach of Article 88(3) of the EC Treaty. The measures described in rows III and IV of Table 5 were all granted after December 2004 and hence after the publication of the 2004 Guidelines. Furthermore, the debt-to-equity swap was granted only in July 2007. The Commission therefore concludes that the 2004 Guidelines apply to the present case with regard to both the notified and the non-notified measures, since they all relate to a single restructuring plan.\n(112)\nIn order to assess the compatibility of the new restructuring aid, it is necessary to look at the restructuring as a whole. All the aid measures, not just the new aid, have to be taken into account to establish whether the plan will result in the restoration of viability, to establish that the aid is limited to the minimum necessary and to determine the appropriate compensatory measures to limit the distortion of competition.\n7.4.2. Eligibility of the firm\n(113)\nFor all the reasons given in the initial decision initiating the formal investigation procedure (25), the company is a company in difficulty as defined in section 2.1 of the 2004 Guidelines and is therefore eligible for restructuring aid.\n7.4.3. Restoration of viability\n(114)\nPoint 35 of the 2004 Guidelines 35 states that ‘the restructuring plan, the duration of which must be as short as possible, must restore the long-term viability of the firm within a reasonable timescale and on the basis of realistic assumptions as to future operating conditions. […] The improvement in viability must derive mainly from internal measures […]’.\n(115)\nThe first crucial problem of HSW was its high indebtedness. The Commission notes that the financial restructuring has been completed.\n(116)\nIn the original decision initiating the formal investigation procedure, the Commission expressed doubts because the restructuring was mainly financial in nature and expressed concern that insufficient account was being taken of industrial aspects of the restructuring. In their comments, the Polish authorities have provided sufficient evidence that the obsolete organisational structure was actually one of the key problems that the company was facing. This problem was addressed by separating the part of the company directly linked to production from the parts to be sold. This was the reason for the temporary creation of the independent HSW-Trading by HSW.\n(117)\nThe sale of shares in subsidiaries and the spinning-off and sale of certain service departments was planned as one of the main elements of restructuring. In the decision initiating the formal investigation procedure, the Commission expressed doubts as to whether the sale plans were realistic. However, HSW has in fact realised more than four times the forecast revenue from the sales.\n(118)\nAnother key factor for the success of the restructuring was the situation regarding the ownership of the trading company Dressta. The controlling share in Dressta held by one of the competitors of HSW obstructed full access to the important North American market. The problem is now solved as HSW has gained control of the company […].\n(119)\nThe restructuring of employment to reduce the workforce by more than 1 000 workers is a real and credible cost-cutting measure.\n(120)\nHSW achieved a profit for the first time in 2005. It also made a profit in the first half of 2006. The November plan suggested that profits would fall at the end of the restructuring period (2007), due to high restructuring costs and the fact that profits for 2005 were inflated by the one-off sale of assets in that year. However, from 2007 onwards, the net result is expected to improve and […] by 2012 […]. By the end of the restructuring period the liquidity problem should have been resolved.\n(121)\nThe Commission had doubts as to whether the November plan could restore the long-term viability of HSW.\n(122)\nFirst, it seemed that HSW was in constant need of additional cash-flow and that the restructuring measures envisaged in the February plan were insufficient, which put into question the credibility of both restructuring plans.\n(123)\nThere is nothing in the explanations provided by the Polish authorities to suggest that the additional cash-flow was anything other than a one-off aid measure granted in 2007, following a rather sudden and substantial change in marketing practices by HSW’s competitors. The Polish authorities have demonstrated that in the future HSW will in all likelihood be able to generate sufficient cash-flow to offer competitive conditions to its clients and suppliers: the indicators for HSW’s financial results after the implementation of various cost-reduction measures are satisfactory. The Commission is therefore satisfied that coverage of those additional cash-flow needs was necessary to keep HSW afloat pending the completion of its restructuring and that the restructuring plan is aimed at ensuring that such financial gaps do not reoccur.\n(124)\nSecond, on the question of hedging policy, the Polish authorities provided sufficient evidence that the company is now tackling the exchange-rate risk in a more efficient way and hence that one of the principal causes of the company’s difficulties has been remedied. Focusing its sales on the more profitable markets of bulldozers and pipelayers has resulted in operating profits. By accounting for most of its sales in euro rather than US dollars, HSW has already decreased variations in the accounting currency and this strategy should bring further benefits in the future when the proportion of sales carried out in euro is set to increase further. Indeed, this strategy is crucial to the company’s return to profitability. If HSW continues to […] as is envisaged both in the February plan and in the November plan it should be able to increase its profits, even if all other factors remain equal. The credibility of HSW’s restructuring strategy has also been boosted by the confidence of market operators in the success of the restructuring.\n(125)\nAs regards the debt-to-equity swap, the Commission notes that the ARP swapped the nominal value of its loans for equity and thereby became a shareholder of HSW.\n(126)\nThe Commission notes that the decision of 20 December 2006 considered the aid element of these two loans to be 100 % of the loan principal, i.e. a total of PLN 75 million, as indicated by the Polish authorities in the notification.\n(127)\nThis debt-to-equity swap changes the form of State aid, since instead of having to reimburse PLN 96,2 million (26) (original two loans totalling PLN 75 million plus PLN 21,2 million in interest) to the ARP and paying regular interest, HSW issued shares amounting to PLN 75 million which have been taken over by the ARP.\n(128)\nThe Commission notes that the ARP implemented the swap on 2 July 2007 without respecting the standstill clause.\n(129)\nPoland admits that the company was better off after the debt-to-equity swap.\n(130)\nThe Commission notes that the debt-to-equity swap will free assets which had served as security for the loans, thereby improving the cash flow of the beneficiary, enabling it to obtain new credit. In accounting terms, the debt-to-equity swap will have the following impact on HSW’s balance sheet. The beneficiary will see its assets increase, since it will not have to use available cash for the reimbursement of the loans. Furthermore, there will be no reduction on the debit side of the balance sheet caused by the repayment of loans. This will also increase the share of equity on the balance sheet, improving both the relative level of indebtedness and HSW’s creditworthiness. Thanks to this operation, in the opinion of the Polish authorities HSW will be able to accumulate the resources needed for its proper functioning on the market and for future necessary investments (27).\n(131)\nIn addition, as regards the profit and loss account, there will be no need to pay interest (a total of PLN 21,2 million) on the loans. Instead HSW would only have to pay potential dividends to the shareholders (including the ARP) in the event of distributable profits.\n(132)\nIn view of the above, the Commission concludes that its doubts as to whether the November plan would lead to the restoration of viability have been allayed.\n7.4.4. Avoidance of undue distortion of competition\n(133)\nUnder points 38 to 42 of the 2004 Guidelines, measures must be taken to mitigate as far as possible any adverse effects of the aid on competitors. The aid must not unduly distort competition. This usually means limiting the company’s presence on given markets at the end of the restructuring period. The compulsory limitation or reduction of the company’s presence on a given market represents a compensatory factor in favour of its competitors. It should be in proportion to the distortive effects of the aid and, in particular, to the relative importance of the firm on its market or markets.\n(134)\nAccording to point 56 of the Guidelines, the conditions for authorising aid are less stringent where compensatory measures are carried out in assisted areas. For the purposes of analysing the impact of the restructuring aid on the market and HSW’s competitors, the Commission is taking account of the fact that HSW is located in an Article 87(3)(a) EC Treaty assisted area.\n(135)\nAccording to the Polish authorities, HSW plans to reduce production capacity from 1 500 construction machines p.a. to 1 200, i.e. by 20 %. The Commission considers this capacity reduction to be insufficient, as the company is anyway planning to use only 66 % of its capacity at the end of the restructuring, i.e. in 2007. None of the information that the Commission has received from the Polish authorities suggests that the company was actually selling more than 1 200 machines before the restructuring began.\n(136)\nFurthermore, the Polish authorities claim that the beneficiary has sold a number of profitable production companies, thereby limiting its activities and production capacity. At least two of the major subsidiaries sold (HSW-Walcownia Blach Sp. z o.o. and HSW-Huta Stali Jakosciowych) were profitable and sold at a profit. In 2005 the combined turnover of these subsidiaries was PLN 460 million (EUR 109 million), with 1 000 employees, whereas turnover from the core activities of the HSW group (HSW and HSW-Trading) was PLN 430 million (EUR 101,9 million), with 2 400 employees. The two subsidiaries sold were active in the production of final steel products. According to an assessment submitted to the Commission, at the time of their sale these subsidiaries were profitable with a forecast return on sales was about 6 %. These two subsidiaries constituted a very significant part of the HSW group, with profitable activities and good prospects on the market.\n(137)\nThe 2004 Guidelines recognise that different forms of aid can have different effects on competition. Furthermore, in order to limit the distortive effect, point 45 stipulates that the amount of the aid or the form in which it is granted must be such as to avoid providing the company with surplus cash which could be used for aggressive, market-distorting activities not linked to the restructuring process. The Commission doubted whether the compensatory measures under the November plan were sufficient. The Polish authorities admit that the effect of swapping HSW’s debt for equity is advantageous for HSW, as it significantly improves the company’s cash-flow situation. HSW is better off thanks to this change in the form of State aid. Moreover, HSW plans to use a major part of the free cash-flow to offer its customers competitive conditions. The Commission therefore considers that the compensatory measures implemented under the February plan would, on their own, be insufficient, as the swap has an additional distorting effect on competition. As a result, the compensatory measures had to be increased, as they have to be in proportion to the distorting effects of the aid (28).\n(138)\nThe Polish authorities informed the Commission by letter dated 22 December 2008 that additional divestments of assets within the meaning of the first sentence of paragraph 39 of the 2004 Guidelines had been implemented.\n(139)\nThe Polish authorities informed the Commission that the beneficiary had sold an additional number of production companies, thereby limiting its activities and production capacity. Six of the subsidiaries sold (HSW-Zakład Kuźnia Matrycowa Sp. z o.o., HSW-Tlenownia Sp. z o.o., HSW-Sprężynownia z o.o., HSW-Lasowiak Sp. z o.o., HSW-Zakład Metalurgiczny Sp. z o.o. and Informatyka Sp. z o.o.) were profitable. The total revenue generated by these companies in the year prior to their sale amounted to PLN 185 million (EUR 43,8 million) and they employed 1 100 workers.\n(140)\nFive of these companies (HSW-Zakład Kuźnia Matrycowa Sp. z o.o., HSW-Tlenownia Sp. z o.o., HSW-Sprężynownia z o.o., HSW-Zakład Metalurgiczny Sp. z o.o. and Informatyka Sp. z o.o.) supplied materials and services to one another within the HSW group as well as to external customers. They supply spare parts such as forged shapes and hot-coiled springs, as well as providing services to other branches of industry, including the rail, machine building, power and mining sectors.\n(141)\nLastly, the Polish authorities pledged that the ARP would sell its HSW shares by the end of 2009.\n(142)\nAs five of the subsidiaries sold by HSW were profitable and were contributing to the production potential of HSW, the Commission is of the opinion that this sale can be considered as a compensatory measure limiting the distortion of competition created by the aid. Taking account of this and the plans to privatise HSW, the Commission considers that the proposed compensatory measures sufficiently limit the distortion of competition created by the aid.\n7.4.5. Aid limited to the minimum\n(143)\nPursuant to points 43 to 45 of the 2004 Guidelines, the aid must be limited to the strict minimum necessary to enable the restructuring of the firm. The form in which the aid is granted must be such as to avoid providing the company with surplus cash which could be used for aggressive, market-distorting activities not necessary for the restructuring process.\n(144)\nIn particular, the aid beneficiary is expected to make a significant contribution to the restructuring from its own resources or from external financing on market conditions.\n(145)\nThe Polish authorities have provided various details on the amounts considered to be own contributions of the beneficiary to the restructuring costs.\n(146)\nFirst, the company plans to obtain bank loans totalling PLN 46,9 million (EUR 11,1 million). The Polish authorities have provided sufficient evidence that HSW will be able to obtain such financing on the market, as it already benefited from private financing amounting to PLN 31,9 million (EUR 7,6 million) between 2003 and 2005. The Polish authorities claim that the beneficiary will be able to find market financing by the end of the restructuring period.\n(147)\nFurthermore, in the February plan HSW had included income from the sale of subsidiaries amounting to PLN 112,2 million (EUR 26,6 million). Under the November plan, the total income from the sale of subsidiaries had increased to PLN 126 million (EUR 29,8 million).\n(148)\nLastly, the beneficiary sold assets amounting to PLN 52,1 million (EUR 12,3 million) under the February plan. Under the November plan this amount increased to PLN 61,4 million (EUR 14,5 million) owing to a further sale of assets.\n(149)\nThe Commission’s doubts as to whether the own contribution of the beneficiary is significant and reaches the threshold of the 2004 Guidelines have been allayed. The restructuring costs amount to PLN 456,9 million (the financial restructuring costs constitute almost half of the total restructuring costs, the remainder being mainly expenses related to the modernisation of the company’s infrastructure and organisational restructuring). As regards the sources of financing of the restructuring, PLN 252,9 million can be considered an own contribution to the restructuring. This total includes financing from private banks (PLN 61,6 million), revenue from the completed sale or lease of assets (PLN 61,4 million) and revenue from the sale of subsidiaries (PLN 126,4 million) (29). HSW’s own contribution to the overall restructuring is therefore 53,9 %, whereas point 44 of the 2004 Guidelines fixes a 50 % minimum level for large enterprises.\n(150)\nIn the decision of 10 October 2007, the Commission not only raised doubts about the own contribution to the costs of the overall restructuring but expressed the view that the Polish authorities’ explanation of the need for the additional cash-flow generated by the debt-to-equity swap had failed to satisfy the Commission that no surplus cash had been provided to HSW. In this respect, the Commission doubted whether the marketing measures designed to enable HSW to compete on the market represented genuine restructuring measures and whether the aid was therefore limited to the minimum necessary. The Polish authorities have allayed these doubts by demonstrating that these measures were necessary for the restoration of viability because HSW needed them in order to stay on the market. It has also been underlined that the additional cash-flow will not be used for the purchase of additional production capacities. The Commission can therefore accept the measures as being necessary for the process of the successful restructuring.\n7.4.6. ‘One time, last time’ principle\n(151)\nThe Commission noted, in the decision to initiate the formal investigation procedure, that HSW - Zakład Zespołów Mechanicznych received restructuring aid granted before accession for the period 2003-2007. It therefore had to be demonstrated that this restructuring aid had had no spillover effects on the parent company. The Polish authorities were also asked to assure the Commission that the restructuring aid to HSW, if approved by the Commission, would not have spillover effects on HSW - Zakład Zespołów Mechanicznych.\n(152)\nThe Polish authorities have assured the Commission that bilateral relations between HSW - Zakład Zespołów Mechanicznych and HSW are based on market terms (including terms of payment and of delivery) and that the companies, as distinct legal entities, keep separate accounts. HSW’s sole consideration when choosing HSW - Zakład Zespołów Mechanicznych as a partner for supplying materials was its geographical proximity.\n7.4.7. Separation between subsidised special military production and civil production\n(153)\nIn its decision of 23 November 2005 initiating the formal investigation procedure, the Commission raised doubts as to whether the separation between subsidised special military production (cannon) and civil production of construction machinery was sufficient to prevent cross-subsidisation between these two fields of activity. The Polish authorities have provided information assuring the Commission that the current cost-accounting system permits the clear separation of costs for the two types of activities mentioned above.\n8. CONCLUSION\n(154)\nThe Commission concludes that the State aid in this case, some of which was granted in breach of the conditions laid down in Article 88(3) of the Treaty, is nevertheless compatible with the common market,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\nArticle 1\nThe Decision of the Commission of 20 December 2006 on State aid C44/05 (ex NN 79/05, ex N 439/04) is revoked.\nArticle 2\nThe State aid in the sum of PLN 66,377 million granted or to be granted in favour of Huta Stalowa Wola SA, some of which was granted in breach of the conditions laid down in Article 88(3) of the Treaty, is compatible with the common market. The aid granted to Huta Stalowa Wola SA in the form of a debt-to-equity swap in respect of loans totalling PLN 75 million is also compatible with the common market.\nArticle 3\nThis Decision is addressed to the Republic of Poland.\nDone at Brussels, 10 March 2009.",

In view of the availability of some of these pesticides on the world market it is prudent to set Maximum Residue Levels for all products at the Lower Limit of Analytical Determination. Some mercuric compounds cannot be distinguished from mercuric compounds originating from environmental contamination.\n(2) Where no legal use of a pesticide is allowed and where no residues can be tolerated it is appropriate that the MRL established at the appropriate lower limit of analytical determination on fresh produce, apply also on the composite and processed products.\n(3) The opinions of the Scientific Committee for Plants have been taken into account, in particular its advice and recommendations concerning the methodology to be followed for the protection of consumers of agricultural products treated with pesticides.\n(4) Annexes to Directives 86/362/EEC, 86/363/EEC and 90/642/EEC should therefore be amended.\n(5) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nArticle 1\nIn part A of Annex II to Directive 86/362/EEC the following rows are added:\nTABLE \"\nArticle 2\nIn part A of Annex II to Directive 86/363/EEC the following rows are added:\nTABLE \"\nArticle 3\nIn part B of Annex II to Directive 86/363/EEC the following rows are added:\nTABLE \"\nArticle 4\nThe maximum residue levels listed in the Annex to this Directive are added to those listed in Annex II to Directive 90/642/EEC for the pesticides in question.\nArticle 5\n1.

            "text": "DIRECTIVE 2006/123/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 12 December 2006\non services in the internal market\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular the first and third sentence of Article 47(2) and Article 55 thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the Commission,\nHaving regard to the Opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nHaving regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions (2),\nActing in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty (3),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nThe European Community is seeking to forge ever closer links between the States and peoples of Europe and to ensure economic and social progress. In accordance with Article 14(2) of the Treaty, the internal market comprises an area without internal frontiers in which the free movement of services is ensured. In accordance with Article 43 of the Treaty the freedom of establishment is ensured. Article 49 of the Treaty establishes the right to provide services within the Community. The elimination of barriers to the development of service activities between Member States is essential in order to strengthen the integration of the peoples of Europe and to promote balanced and sustainable economic and social progress. In eliminating such barriers it is essential to ensure that the development of service activities contributes to the fulfilment of the task laid down in Article 2 of the Treaty of promoting throughout the Community a harmonious, balanced and sustainable development of economic activities, a high level of employment and of social protection, equality between men and women, sustainable and non-inflationary growth, a high degree of competitiveness and convergence of economic performance, a high level of protection and improvement of the quality of the environment, the raising of the standard of living and quality of life and economic and social cohesion and solidarity among Member States.\n(2)\nA competitive market in services is essential in order to promote economic growth and create jobs in the European Union. At present numerous barriers within the internal market prevent providers, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), from extending their operations beyond their national borders and from taking full advantage of the internal market. This weakens the worldwide competitiveness of European Union providers. A free market which compels the Member States to eliminate restrictions on cross-border provision of services while at the same time increasing transparency and information for consumers would give consumers wider choice and better services at lower prices.\n(3)\nThe report from the Commission on ‘The State of the Internal Market for Services’ drew up an inventory of a large number of barriers which are preventing or slowing down the development of services between Member States, in particular those provided by SMEs, which are predominant in the field of services. The report concludes that a decade after the envisaged completion of the internal market, there is still a huge gap between the vision of an integrated European Union economy and the reality as experienced by European citizens and providers. The barriers affect a wide variety of service activities across all stages of the provider's activity and have a number of common features, including the fact that they often arise from administrative burdens, the legal uncertainty associated with cross-border activity and the lack of mutual trust between Member States.\n(4)\nSince services constitute the engine of economic growth and account for 70 % of GDP and employment in most Member States, this fragmentation of the internal market has a negative impact on the entire European economy, in particular on the competitiveness of SMEs and the movement of workers, and prevents consumers from gaining access to a greater variety of competitively priced services. It is important to point out that the services sector is a key employment sector for women in particular, and that they therefore stand to benefit greatly from new opportunities offered by the completion of the internal market for services. The European Parliament and the Council have emphasised that the removal of legal barriers to the establishment of a genuine internal market is a matter of priority for achieving the goal set by the European Council in Lisbon of 23 and 24 March 2000 of improving employment and social cohesion and achieving sustainable economic growth so as to make the European Union the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010, with more and better jobs. Removing those barriers, while ensuring an advanced European social model, is thus a basic condition for overcoming the difficulties encountered in implementing the Lisbon Strategy and for reviving the European economy, particularly in terms of employment and investment. It is therefore important to achieve an internal market for services, with the right balance between market opening and preserving public services and social and consumer rights.\n(5)\nIt is therefore necessary to remove barriers to the freedom of establishment for providers in Member States and barriers to the free movement of services as between Member States and to guarantee recipients and providers the legal certainty necessary for the exercise in practice of those two fundamental freedoms of the Treaty. Since the barriers in the internal market for services affect operators who wish to become established in other Member States as well as those who provide a service in another Member State without being established there, it is necessary to enable providers to develop their service activities within the internal market either by becoming established in a Member State or by making use of the free movement of services. Providers should be able to choose between those two freedoms, depending on their strategy for growth in each Member State.\n(6)\nThose barriers cannot be removed solely by relying on direct application of Articles 43 and 49 of the Treaty, since, on the one hand, addressing them on a case-by-case basis through infringement procedures against the Member States concerned would, especially following enlargement, be extremely complicated for national and Community institutions, and, on the other hand, the lifting of many barriers requires prior coordination of national legal schemes, including the setting up of administrative cooperation. As the European Parliament and the Council have recognised, a Community legislative instrument makes it possible to achieve a genuine internal market for services.\n(7)\nThis Directive establishes a general legal framework which benefits a wide variety of services while taking into account the distinctive features of each type of activity or profession and its system of regulation. That framework is based on a dynamic and selective approach consisting in the removal, as a matter of priority, of barriers which may be dismantled quickly and, for the others, the launching of a process of evaluation, consultation and complementary harmonisation of specific issues, which will make possible the progressive and coordinated modernisation of national regulatory systems for service activities which is vital in order to achieve a genuine internal market for services by 2010. Provision should be made for a balanced mix of measures involving targeted harmonisation, administrative cooperation, the provision on the freedom to provide services and encouragement of the development of codes of conduct on certain issues. That coordination of national legislative regimes should ensure a high degree of Community legal integration and a high level of protection of general interest objectives, especially protection of consumers, which is vital in order to establish trust between Member States. This Directive also takes into account other general interest objectives, including the protection of the environment, public security and public health as well as the need to comply with labour law.\n(8)\nIt is appropriate that the provisions of this Directive concerning the freedom of establishment and the free movement of services should apply only to the extent that the activities in question are open to competition, so that they do not oblige Member States either to liberalise services of general economic interest or to privatise public entities which provide such services or to abolish existing monopolies for other activities or certain distribution services.\n(9)\nThis Directive applies only to requirements which affect the access to, or the exercise of, a service activity. Therefore, it does not apply to requirements, such as road traffic rules, rules concerning the development or use of land, town and country planning, building standards as well as administrative penalties imposed for non-compliance with such rules which do not specifically regulate or specifically affect the service activity but have to be respected by providers in the course of carrying out their economic activity in the same way as by individuals acting in their private capacity.\n(10)\nThis Directive does not concern requirements governing access to public funds for certain providers. Such requirements include notably those laying down conditions under which providers are entitled to receive public funding, including specific contractual conditions, and in particular quality standards which need to be observed as a condition for receiving public funds, for example for social services.\n(11)\nThis Directive does not interfere with measures taken by Member States, in accordance with Community law, in relation to the protection or promotion of cultural and linguistic diversity and media pluralism, including the funding thereof. This Directive does not prevent Member States from applying their fundamental rules and principles relating to the freedom of press and freedom of expression. This Directive does not affect Member State laws prohibiting discrimination on grounds of nationality or on grounds such as those set out in Article 13 of the Treaty.\n(12)\nThis Directive aims at creating a legal framework to ensure the freedom of establishment and the free movement of services between the Member States and does not harmonise or prejudice criminal law. However, Member States should not be able to restrict the freedom to provide services by applying criminal law provisions which specifically affect the access to or the exercise of a service activity in circumvention of the rules laid down in this Directive.\n(13)\nIt is equally important that this Directive fully respect Community initiatives based on Article 137 of the Treaty with a view to achieving the objectives of Article 136 thereof concerning the promotion of employment and improved living and working conditions.\n(14)\nThis Directive does not affect terms and conditions of employment, including maximum work periods and minimum rest periods, minimum paid annual holidays, minimum rates of pay as well as health, safety and hygiene at work, which Member States apply in compliance with Community law, nor does it affect relations between social partners, including the right to negotiate and conclude collective agreements, the right to strike and to take industrial action in accordance with national law and practices which respect Community law, nor does it apply to services provided by temporary work agencies. This Directive does not affect Member States' social security legislation.\n(15)\nThis Directive respects the exercise of fundamental rights applicable in the Member States and as recognised in the Charter of fundamental Rights of the European Union and the accompanying explanations, reconciling them with the fundamental freedoms laid down in Articles 43 and 49 of the Treaty. Those fundamental rights include the right to take industrial action in accordance with national law and practices which respect Community law.\n(16)\nThis Directive concerns only providers established in a Member State and does not cover external aspects. It does not concern negotiations within international organisations on trade in services, in particular in the framework of the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS).\n(17)\nThis Directive covers only services which are performed for an economic consideration. Services of general interest are not covered by the definition in Article 50 of the Treaty and therefore do not fall within the scope of this Directive. Services of general economic interest are services that are performed for an economic consideration and therefore do fall within the scope of this Directive. However, certain services of general economic interest, such as those that may exist in the field of transport, are excluded from the scope of this Directive and certain other services of general economic interest, for example, those that may exist in the area of postal services, are the subject of a derogation from the provision on the freedom to provide services set out in this Directive. This Directive does not deal with the funding of services of general economic interest and does not apply to systems of aids granted by Member States, in particular in the social field, in accordance with Community rules on competition. This Directive does not deal with the follow-up to the Commission White Paper on Services of General Interest.\n(18)\nFinancial services should be excluded from the scope of this Directive since these activities are the subject of specific Community legislation aimed, as is this Directive, at achieving a genuine internal market for services. Consequently, t his exclusion should cover all financial services such as banking, credit, insurance, including reinsurance, occupational or personal pensions, securities, investment funds, payments and investment advice, including the services listed in Annex I to Directive 2006/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 June 2006 relating to the taking up and pursuit of the business of credit institutions (4).\n(19)\nIn view of the adoption in 2002 of a package of legislative instruments relating to electronic communications networks and services, as well as to associated resources and services, which has established a regulatory framework facilitating access to those activities within the internal market, notably through the elimination of most individual authorisation schemes, it is necessary to exclude issues dealt with by those instruments from the scope of this Directive.\n(20)\nThe exclusion from the scope of this Directive as regards matters of electronic communications services as covered by Directives 2002/19/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on access to, and interconnection of, electronic communications networks and associated facilities (Access Directive) (5), 2002/20/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on the authorisation of electronic communications networks and services (Authorisation Directive) (6), 2002/21/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on a common regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services (Framework Directive) (7), 2002/22/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on universal service and users' rights relating to electronic communications networks and services (Universal Service Directive) (8) and 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (Directive on privacy and electronic communications) (9) should apply not only to questions specifically dealt with in these Directives but also to matters for which the Directives explicitly leave to Member States the possibility of adopting certain measures at national level.\n(21)\nTransport services, including urban transport, taxis and ambulances as well as port services, should be excluded from the scope of this Directive.\n(22)\nThe exclusion of healthcare from the scope of this Directive should cover healthcare and pharmaceutical services provided by health professionals to patients to assess, maintain or restore their state of health where those activities are reserved to a regulated health profession in the Member State in which the services are provided.\n(23)\nThis Directive does not affect the reimbursement of healthcare provided in a Member State other than that in which the recipient of the care is resident. This issue has been addressed by the Court of Justice on numerous occasions, and the Court has recognised patients' rights. It is important to address this issue in another Community legal instrument in order to achieve greater legal certainty and clarity to the extent that this issue is not already addressed in Council Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 of 14 June 1971 on the application of social security schemes to employed persons, to self-employed persons and to members of their families moving within the Community (10).\n(24)\nAudiovisual services, whatever their mode of transmission, including within cinemas, should also be excluded from the scope of this Directive. Furthermore, this Directive should not apply to aids granted by Member States in the audiovisual sector which are covered by Community rules on competition.\n(25)\nGambling activities, including lottery and betting transactions, should be excluded from the scope of this Directive in view of the specific nature of these activities, which entail implementation by Member States of policies relating to public policy and consumer protection.\n(26)\nThis Directive is without prejudice to the application of Article 45 of the Treaty.\n(27)\nThis Directive should not cover those social services in the areas of housing, childcare and support to families and persons in need which are provided by the State at national, regional or local level by providers m andated by the State or by charities recognised as such by the State with the objective of ensuring support for those who are permanently or temporarily in a particular state of need because of their insufficient family income or total or partial lack of independence and for those who risk being marginalised. These services are essential in order to guarantee the fundamental right to human dignity and integrity and are a manifestation of the principles of social cohesion and solidarity and should not be affected by this Directive.\n(28)\nThis Directive does not deal with the funding of, or the system of aids linked to, social services. Nor does it affect the criteria or conditions set by Member States to ensure that social services effectively carry out a function to the benefit of the public interest and social cohesion. In addition, this Directive should not affect the principle of universal service in Member States' social services.\n(29)\nGiven that the Treaty provides specific legal bases for taxation matters and given the Community instruments already adopted in that field, it is necessary to exclude the field of taxation from the scope of this Directive.\n(30)\nThere is already a considerable body of Community law on service activities. This Directive builds on, and thus complements, the Community acquis. Conflicts between this Directive and other Community instruments have been identified and are addressed by this Directive, including by means of derogations. However, it is necessary to provide a rule for any residual and exceptional cases where there is a conflict between a provision of this Directive and a provision of another Community instrument. The existence of such a conflict should be determined in compliance with the rules of the Treaty on the right of establishment and the free movement of services.\n(31)\nThis Directive is consistent with and does not affect Directive 2005/36/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 September 2005 on the recognition of professional qualifications (11). It deals with questions other than those relating to professional qualifications, for example professional liability insurance, commercial communications, multidisciplinary activities and administrative simplification. With regard to temporary cross-border service provision, a derogation from the provision on the freedom to provide services in this Directive ensures that Title II on the free provision of services of Directive 2005/36/EC is not affected. Therefore, none of the measures applicable under that Directive in the Member State where the service is provided is affected by the provision on the freedom to provide services.\n(32)\nThis Directive is consistent with Community legislation on consumer protection, such as Directive 2005/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 May 2005 concerning unfair business-to-consumer commercial practices in the internal market (the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive) (12) and Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 October 2004 on cooperation between national authorities responsible for the enforcement of consumer protection laws (the Regulation on consumer protection cooperation) (13).\n(33)\nThe services covered by this Directive concern a wide variety of ever-changing activities, including business services such as management consultancy, certification and testing; facilities management, including office maintenance; advertising; recruitment services; and the services of commercial agents. The services covered are also services provided both to businesses and to consumers, such as legal or fiscal advice; real estate services such as estate agencies; construction, including the services of architects; distributive trades; the organisation of trade fairs; car rental; and travel agencies. Consumer services are also covered, such as those in the field of tourism, including tour guides; leisure services, sports centres and amusement parks; and, to the extent that they are not excluded from the scope of application of the Directive, household support services, such as help for the elderly. Those activities may involve services requiring the proximity of provider and recipient, services requiring travel by the recipient or the provider and services which may be provided at a distance, including via the Internet.\n(34)\nAccording to the case-law of the Court of Justice, the assessment of whether certain activities, in particular activities which are publicly funded or provided by public entities, constitute a ‘service’ has to be carried out on a case by case basis in the light of all their characteristics, in particular the way they are provided, organised and financed in the Member State concerned. The Court of Justice has held that the essential characteristic of remuneration lies in the fact that it constitutes consideration for the services in question and has recognised that the characteristic of remuneration is absent in the case of activities performed, for no consideration, by the State or on behalf of the State in the context of its duties in the social, cultural, educational and judicial fields, such as courses provided under the national education system, or the management of social security schemes which do not engage in economic activity. The payment of a fee by recipients, for example, a tuition or enrolment fee paid by students in order to make a certain contribution to the operating expenses of a system, does not in itself constitute remuneration because the service is still essentially financed by public funds. These activities are, therefore, not covered by the definition of service in Article 50 of the Treaty and do not therefore fall within the scope of this Directive.\n(35)\nNon-profit making amateur sporting activities are of considerable social importance. They often pursue wholly social or recreational objectives. Thus, they might not constitute economic activities within the meaning of Community law and should fall outside the scope of this Directive.\n(36)\nThe concept of ‘provider’ should cover any natural person who is a national of a Member State or any legal person engaged in a service activity in a Member State, in exercise either of the freedom of establishment or of the free movement of services. The concept of provider should thus not be limited solely to cross-border service provision within the framework of the free movement of services but should also cover cases in which an operator establishes itself in a Member State in order to develop its service activities there. On the other hand, the concept of a provider should not cover the case of branches in a Member State of companies from third countries because, under Article 48 of the Treaty, the freedom of establishment and free movement of services may benefit only companies constituted in accordance with the laws of a Member State and having their registered office, central administration or principal place of business within the Community. The concept of ‘recipient’ should also cover third country nationals who already benefit from rights conferred upon them by Community acts such as Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71, Council Directive 2003/109/EC of 25 November 2003 concerning the status of third-country nationals who are long-term residents (14), Council Regulation (EC) No 859/2003 of 14 May 2003 extending the provisions of Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 and Regulation (EEC) No 574/72 to nationals of third countries who are not already covered by those provisions solely on the ground of their nationality (15) and Directive 2004/38/ECof the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States (16). Furthermore, Member States may extend the concept of recipient to other third country nationals that are present within their territory.\n(37)\nThe place at which a provider is established should be determined in accordance with the case law of the Court of Justice according to which the concept of establishment involves the actual pursuit of an economic activity through a fixed establishment for an indefinite period. This requirement may also be fulfilled where a company is constituted for a given period or where it rents the building or installation through which it pursues its activity. It may also be fulfilled where a Member State grants authorisations for a limited duration only in relation to particular services. An establishment does not need to take the form of a subsidiary, branch or agency, but may consist of an office managed by a provider's own staff or by a person who is independent but authorised to act on a permanent basis for the undertaking, as would be the case with an agency. According to this definition, which requires the actual pursuit of an economic activity at the place of establishment of the provider, a mere letter box does not constitute an establishment. Where a provider has several places of establishment, it is important to determine the place of establishment from which the actual service concerned is provided. Where it is difficult to determine from which of several places of establishment a given service is provided, the location of the provider's centre of activities relating to this particular service should be that place of establishment.\n(38)\nThe concept of ‘legal persons’, according to the Treaty provisions on establishment, leaves operators free to choose the legal form which they deem suitable for carrying out their activity. Accordingly, ‘legal persons’, within the meaning of the Treaty, means all entities constituted under, or governed by, the law of a Member State, irrespective of their legal form.\n(39)\nThe concept of ‘authorisation scheme’ should cover, inter alia, the administrative procedures for granting authorisations, licences, approvals or concessions, and also the obligation, in order to be eligible to exercise the activity, to be registered as a member of a profession or entered in a register, roll or database, to be officially appointed to a body or to obtain a card attesting to membership of a particular profession. Authorisation may be granted not only by a formal decision but also by an implicit decision arising, for example, from the silence of the competent authority or from the fact that the interested party must await acknowledgement of receipt of a declaration in order to commence the activity in question or for the latter to become lawful.\n(40)\nThe concept of ‘overriding reasons relating to the public interest’ to which reference is made in certain provisions of this Directive has been developed by the Court of Justice in its case law in relation to Articles 43 and 49 of the Treaty and may continue to evolve. The notion as recognised in the case law of the Court of Justice covers at least the following grounds: public policy, public security and public health, within the meaning of Articles 46 and 55 of the Treaty; the maintenance of order in society; social policy objectives; the protection of the recipients of services; consumer protection; the protection of workers, including the social protection of workers; animal welfare; the preservation of the financial balance of the social security system; the prevention of fraud; the prevention of unfair competition; the protection of the environment and the urban environment, including town and country planning; the protection of creditors; safeguarding the sound administration of justice; road safety; the protection of intellectual property; cultural policy objectives, including safeguarding the freedom of expression of various elements, in particular social, cultural, religious and philosophical values of society; the need to ensure a high level of education, the maintenance of press diversity and the promotion of the national language; the preservation of national historical and artistic heritage; and veterinary policy.\n(41)\nThe concept of ‘public policy’, as interpreted by the Court of Justice, covers the protection against a genuine and sufficiently serious threat affecting one of the fundamental interests of society and may include, in particular, issues relating to human dignity, the protection of minors and vulnerable adults and animal welfare. Similarly, the concept of public security includes issues of public safety.\n(42)\nThe rules relating to administrative procedures should not aim at harmonising administrative procedures but at removing overly burdensome authorisation schemes, procedures and formalities that hinder the freedom of establishment and the creation of new service undertakings therefrom.\n(43)\nOne of the fundamental difficulties faced, in particular by SMEs, in accessing service activities and exercising them is the complexity, length and legal uncertainty of administrative procedures. For this reason, following the example of certain modernising and good administrative practice initiatives undertaken at Community and national level, it is necessary to establish principles of administrative simplification, inter alia through the limitation of the obligation of prior authorisation to cases in which it is essential and the introduction of the principle of tacit authorisation by the competent authorities after a certain period of time elapsed. Such modernising action, while maintaining the requirements on transparency and the updating of information relating to operators, is intended to eliminate the delays, costs and dissuasive effects which arise, for example, from unnecessary or excessively complex and burdensome procedures, the duplication of procedures, the ‘red tape’ involved in submitting documents, the arbitrary use of powers by the competent authorities, indeterminate or excessively long periods before a response is given, the limited duration of validity of authorisations granted and disproportionate fees and penalties. Such practices have particularly significant dissuasive effects on providers wishing to develop their activities in other Member States and require coordinated modernisation within an enlarged internal market of twenty-five Member States.\n(44)\nMember States should introduce, where appropriate, forms harmonised at Community level, as established by the Commission, which will serve as an equivalent to certificates, attestations or any other document in relation to establishment.\n(45)\nIn order to examine the need for simplifying procedures and formalities, Member States should be able, in particular, to take into account their necessity, number, possible duplication, cost, clarity and accessibility, as well as the delay and practical difficulties to which they could give rise for the provider concerned.\n(46)\nIn order to facilitate access to service activities and the exercise thereof in the internal market, it is necessary to establish an objective, common to all Member States, of administrative simplification and to lay down provisions concerning, inter alia, the right to information, procedures by electronic means and the establishment of a framework for authorisation schemes. Other measures adopted at national level to meet that objective could involve reduction of the number of procedures and formalities applicable to service activities and the restriction of such procedures and formalities to those which are essential in order to achieve a general interest objective and which do not duplicate each other in terms of content or purpose.\n(47)\nWith the aim of administrative simplification, general formal requirements, such as presentation of original documents, certified copies or a certified translation, should not be imposed, except where objectively justified by an overriding reason relating to the public interest, such as the protection of workers, public health, the protection of the environment or the protection of consumers. It is also necessary to ensure that an authorisation as a general rule permits access to, or exercise of, a service activity throughout the national territory, unless a new authorisation for each establishment, for example for each new hypermarket, or an authorisation that is restricted to a specific part of the national territory is objectively justified by an overriding reason relating to the public interest.\n(48)\nIn order to further simplify administrative procedures, it is appropriate to ensure that each provider has a single point through which he can complete all procedures and formalities (hereinafter referred to as ‘points of single contact’). The number of points of single contact per Member State may vary according to regional or local competencies or according to the activities concerned. The creation of points of single contact should not interfere with the allocation of functions among competent authorities within each national system. Where several authorities at regional or local level are competent, one of them may assume the role of point of single contact and coordinator. Points of single contact may be set up not only by administrative authorities but also by chambers of commerce or crafts, or by the professional organisations or private bodies to which a Member State decides to entrust that function. Points of single contact have an important role to play in providing assistance to providers either as the authority directly competent to issue the documents necessary to access a service activity or as an intermediary between the provider and the authorities which are directly competent.\n(49)\nThe fee which may be charged by points of single contact should be proportionate to the cost of the procedures and formalities with which they deal. This should not prevent Member States from entrusting the points of single contact with the collection of other administrative fees, such as the fee of supervisory bodies.\n(50)\nIt is necessary for providers and recipients of services to have easy access to certain types of information It should be for each Member State to determine, within the framework of this Directive, the way in which providers and recipients are provided with information. In particular, the obligation on Member States to ensure that relevant information is easily accessible to providers and recipients and that it can be accessed by the public without obstacle could be fulfilled by making this information accessible through a website. Any information given should be provided in a clear and unambiguous manner.\n(51)\nThe information provided to providers and recipients of services should include, in particular, information on procedures and formalities, contact details of the competent authorities, conditions for access to public registers and data bases and information concerning available remedies and the contact details of associations and organisations from which providers or recipients can obtain practical assistance. The obligation on competent authorities to assist providers and recipients should not include the provision of legal advice in individual cases. Nevertheless, general information on the way in which requirements are usually interpreted or applied should be given. Issues such as liability for providing incorrect or misleading information should be determined by Member States.\n(52)\nThe setting up, in the reasonably near future, of electronic means of completing procedures and formalities will be vital for administrative simplification in the field of service activities, for the benefit of providers, recipients and competent authorities. In order to meet that obligation as to results, national laws and other rules applicable to services may need to be adapted. This obligation should not prevent Member States from providing other means of completing such procedures and formalities, in addition to electronic means. The fact that it must be possible to complete those procedures and formalities at a distance means, in particular, that Member States must ensure that they may be completed across borders. The obligation as to results does not cover procedures or formalities which by their very nature are impossible to complete at a distance. Furthermore, this does not interfere with Member States' legislation on the use of languages.\n(53)\nThe granting of licences for certain service activities may require an interview with the applicant by the competent authority in order to assess the applicant's personal integrity and suitability for carrying out the service in question. In such cases, the completion of formalities by electronic means may not be appropriate.\n(54)\nThe possibility of gaining access to a service activity should be made subject to authorisation by the competent authorities only if that decision satisfies the criteria of non-discrimination, necessity and proportionality. That means, in particular, that authorisation schemes should be permissible only where an a posteriori inspection would not be effective because of the impossibility of ascertaining the defects of the services concerned a posteriori, due account being taken of the risks and dangers which could arise in the absence of a prior inspection. However, the provision to that effect made by this Directive cannot be relied upon in order to justify authorisation schemes which are prohibited by other Community instruments such as Directive 1999/93/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of 13 December 1999 on a Community framework for electronic signatures (17), or Directive 2000/31/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 June 2000 on certain legal aspects of information society services, in particular electronic commerce, in the internal market (Directive on electronic commerce) (18). The results of the process of mutual evaluation will make it possible to determine, at Community level, the types of activity for which authorisation schemes should be eliminated.\n(55)\nThis Directive should be without prejudice to the possibility for Member States to withdraw authorisations after they have been issued, if the conditions for the granting of the authorisation are no longer fulfilled.\n(56)\nAccording to the case law of the Court of Justice, public health, consumer protection, animal health and the protection of the urban environment constitute overriding reasons relating to the public interest. Such overriding reasons may justify the application of authorisation schemes and other restrictions. However, no such authorisation scheme or restriction should discriminate on grounds of nationality. Further, the principles of necessity and proportionality should always be respected.\n(57)\nThe provisions of this Directive relating to authorisation schemes should concern cases where the access to or exercise of a service activity by operators requires a decision by a competent authority. This concerns neither decisions by competent authorities to set up a public or private entity for the provision of a particular service nor the conclusion of contracts by competent authorities for the provision of a particular service which is governed by rules on public procurement, since this Directive does not deal with rules on public procurement.\n(58)\nIn order to facilitate access to and exercise of service activities, it is important to evaluate and report on authorisation schemes and their justification. This reporting obligation concerns only the existence of authorisation schemes and not the criteria and conditions for the granting of an authorisation.\n(59)\nThe authorisation should as a general rule enable the provider to have access to the service activity, or to exercise that activity, throughout the national territory, unless a territorial limit is justified by an overriding reason relating to the public interest. For example, environmental protection may justify the requirement to obtain an individual authorisation for each installation on the national territory. This provision should not affect regional or local competences for the granting of authorisations within the Member States.\n(60)\nThis Directive, and in particular the provisions concerning authorisation schemes and the territorial scope of an authorisation, should not interfere with the division of regional or local competences within the Member States, including regional and local self-government and the use of official languages.\n(61)\nThe provision relating to the non-duplication of conditions for the granting of an authorisation should not prevent Member States from applying their own conditions as specified in the authorisation scheme. It should only require that competent authorities, when considering whether these conditions are met by the applicant, take into account the equivalent conditions which have already been satisfied by the applicant in another Member State. This provision should not require the application of the conditions for the granting of an authorisation provided for in the authorisation scheme of another Member State.\n(62)\nWhere the number of authorisations available for an activity is limited because of scarcity of natural resources or technical capacity, a procedure for selection from among several potential candidates should be adopted with the aim of developing through open competition the quality and conditions for supply of services available to users. Such a procedure should provide guarantees of transparency and impartiality and the authorisation thus granted should not have an excessive duration, be subject to automatic renewal or confer any advantage on the provider whose authorisation has just expired. In particular, the duration of the authorisation granted should be fixed in such a way that it does not restrict or limit free competition beyond what is necessary in order to enable the provider to recoup the cost of investment and to make a fair return on the capital invested. This provision should not prevent Member States from limiting the number of authorisations for reasons other than scarcity of natural resources or technical capacity. These authorisationsshould remain in any case subject to the other provisions of this Directive relating to authorisation schemes.\n(63)\nIn the absence of different arrangements, failing a response within a time period, an authorisation should be deemed to have been granted. However, different arrangements may be put in place in respect of certain activities, where objectively justified by overriding reasons relating to the public interest, including a legitimate interest of third parties. Such different arrangements could include national rules according to which, in the absence of a response of the competent authority, the application is deemed to have been rejected, this rejection being open to challenge before the courts.\n(64)\nIn order to establish a genuine internal market for services, it is necessary to abolish any restrictions on the freedom of establishment and the free movement of services which are still enshrined in the laws of certain Member States and which are incompatible with Articles 43 and 49 of the Treaty respectively. The restrictions to be prohibited particularly affect the internal market for services and should be systematically dismantled as soon as possible.\n(65)\nFreedom of establishment is predicated, in particular, upon the principle of equal treatment, which entails the prohibition not only of any discrimination on grounds of nationality but also of any indirect discrimination based on other grounds but capable of producing the same result. Thus, access to a service activity or the exercise thereof in a Member State, either as a principal or secondary activity, should not be made subject to criteria such as place of establishment, residence, domicile or principal provision of the service activity. However, these criteria should not include requirements according to which a provider or one of his employees or a representative must be present during the exercise of the activity when this is justified by an overriding reason relating to the public interest. Furthermore, a Member State should not restrict the legal capacity or the right of companies, incorporated in accordance with the law of another Member State on whose territory they have their primary establishment, to bring legal proceedings. Moreover, a Member State should not be able to confer any advantages on providers having a particular national or local socio-economic link; nor should it be able to restrict, on grounds of place of establishment, the provider's freedom to acquire, exploit or dispose of rights and goods or to access different forms of credit or accommodation in so far as those choices are useful for access to his activity or for the effective exercise thereof.\n(66)\nAccess to or the exercise of a service activity in the territory of a Member State should not be subject to an economic test. The prohibition of economic tests as a prerequisite for the grant of authorisation should cover economic tests as such, but not requirements which are objectively justified by overriding reasons relating to the public interest, such as the protection of the urban environment, social policy or public health. The prohibition should not affect the exercise of the powers of the authorities responsible for applying competition law.\n(67)\nWith respect to financial guarantees or insurance, the prohibition of requirements should concern only the obligation that the requested financial guarantees or insurance must be obtained from a financial institution established in the Member State concerned.\n(68)\nWith respect to pre-registration, the prohibition of requirements should concern only the obligation that the provider, prior to the establishment, be pre-registered for a given period in a register held in the Member State concerned.\n(69)\nIn order to coordinate the modernisation of national rules and regulations in a manner consistent with the requirements of the internal market, it is necessary to evaluate certain non-discriminatory national requirements which, by their very nature, could severely restrict or even prevent access to an activity or the exercise thereof under the freedom of establishment. This evaluation process should be limited to the compatibility of these requirements with the criteria already established by the Court of Justice on the freedom of establishment. It should not concern the application of Community competition law. Where such requirements are discriminatory or not objectively justified by an overriding reason relating to the public interest, or where they are disproportionate, they must be abolished or amended. The outcome of this assessment will be different according to the nature of the activity and the public interest concerned. In particular, such requirements could be fully justified when they pursue social policy objectives.\n(70)\nFor the purposes of this Directive, and without prejudice to Article 16 of the Treaty, services may be considered to be services of general economic interest only if they are provided in application of a special task in the public interest entrusted to the provider by the Member State concerned. This assignment should be made by way of one or more acts, the form of which is determined by the Member State concerned, and should specify the precise nature of the special task.\n(71)\nThe mutual evaluation process provided for in this Directive should not affect the freedom of Member States to set in their legislation a high level of protection of the public interest, in particular in relation to social policy objectives. Furthermore, it is necessary that the mutual evaluation process take fully into account the specificity of services of general economic interest and of the particular tasks assigned to them. This may justify certain restrictions on the freedom of establishment, in particular where such restrictions pursue the protection of public health and social policy objectives and where they satisfy the conditions set out in Article 15(3)(a), (b) and (c). For example, with regard to the obligation to take a specific legal form in order to exercise certain services in the social field, the Court of Justice has already recognised that it may be justified to subject the provider to a requirement to be non-profit making.\n(72)\nServices of a general economic interest are entrusted with important tasks relating to social and territorial cohesion. The performance of these tasks should not be obstructed as a result of the evaluation process provided for in this Directive. Requirements which are necessary for the fulfilment of such tasks should not be affected by this process while, at the same time, unjustified restrictions on the freedom of establishment should be addressed.\n(73)\nThe requirements to be examined include national rules which, on grounds other than those relating to professional qualifications, reserve access to certain activities to particular providers. These requirements also include obligations on a provider to take a specific legal form, in particular to be a legal person, to be a company with individual ownership, to be a non-profit making organisation or a company owned exclusively by natural persons, and requirements which relate to the shareholding of a company, in particular obligations to hold a minimum amount of capital for certain service activities or to have a specific qualification in order to hold share capital in or to manage certain companies. The evaluation of the compatibility of fixed minimum and/or maximum tariffs with the freedom of establishment concerns only tariffs imposed by competent authorities specifically for the provision of certain services and not, for example, general rules on price determination, such as for the renting of houses.\n(74)\nThe mutual evaluation process means that during the transposition period Member States will first have to conduct a screening of their legislation in order to ascertain whether any of the above mentioned requirements exists in their legal systems. At the latest by the end of the transposition period, Member States should draw up a report on the results of this screening. Each report will be submitted to all other Member States and interested parties. Member States will then have six months in which to submit their observations on these reports. At the latest by one year after the date of transposition of this Directive, the Commission should draw up a summary report, accompanied where appropriate by proposals for further initiatives. If necessary the Commission, in cooperation with the Member States, could assist them to design a common method.\n(75)\nThe fact that this Directive specifies a number of requirements to be abolished or evaluated by the Member States during the transposition period is without prejudice to any infringement proceedings against a Member State for failure to fulfil its obligations under Articles 43 or 49 of the Treaty.\n(76)\nThis Directive does not concern the application of Articles 28 to 30 of the Treaty relating to the free movement of goods. The restrictions prohibited pursuant to the provision on the freedom to provide services cover the requirements applicable to access to service activities or to the exercise thereof and not those applicable to goods as such.\n(77)\nWhere an operator travels to another Member State to exercise a service activity there, a distinction should be made between situations covered by the freedom of establishment and those covered, due to the temporary nature of the activities concerned, by the free movement of services. As regards the distinction between the freedom of establishment and the free movement of services, according to the case law of the Court of Justice the key element is whether or not the operator is established in the Member State where it provides the service concerned. If the operator is established in the Member State where it provides its services, it should come under the scope of application of the freedom of establishment. If, by contrast, the operator is not established in the Member State where the service is provided, its activities should be covered by the free movement of services. The Court of Justice has consistently held that the temporary nature of the activities in question should be determined in the light not only of the duration of the provision of the service, but also of its regularity, periodical nature or continuity. The fact that the activity is temporary should not mean that the provider may not equip itself with some forms of infrastructure in the Member State where the service is provided, such as an office, chambers or consulting rooms, in so far as such infrastructure is necessary for the purposes of providing the service in question.\n(78)\nIn order to secure effective implementation of the free movement of services and to ensure that recipients and providers can benefit from and supply services throughout the Community regardless of borders, it is necessary to clarify the extent to which requirements of the Member State where the service is provided can be imposed. It is indispensable to provide that the provision on the freedom to provide services does not prevent the Member State where the service is provided from imposing, in compliance with the principles set out in Article 16(1)(a) to (c), its specific requirements for reasons of public policy or public security or for the protection of public health or the environment.\n(79)\nThe Court of Justice has consistently held that Member States retain the right to take measures in order to prevent providers from abusively taking advantage of the internal market principles. Abuse by a provider should be established on a case by case basis.\n(80)\nIt is necessary to ensure that providers are able to take equipment which is integral to the provision of their service with them when they travel to provide services in another Member State. In particular, it is important to avoid cases in which the service could not be provided without the equipment or situations in which providers incur additional costs, for example, by hiring or purchasing different equipment to that which they habitually use or by needing to deviate significantly from the way they habitually carry out their activity.\n(81)\nThe concept of equipment does not refer to physical objects which are either supplied by the provider to the client or become part of a physical object as a result of the service activity, such as building materials or spare parts, or which are consumed or left in situ in the course of the service provision, such as combustible fuels, explosives, fireworks, pesticides, poisons or medicines.\n(82)\nThe provisions of this Directive should not preclude the application by a Member State of rules on employment conditions. Rules laid down by law, regulation or administrative provisions should, in accordance with the Treaty, be justified for reasons relating to the protection of workers and be non-discriminatory, necessary, and proportionate, as interpreted by the Court of Justice, and comply with other relevant Community law.\n(83)\nIt is necessary to ensure that the provision on the freedom to provide services may be departed from only in the areas covered by derogations. Those derogations are necessary in order to take into account the level of integration of the internal market or certain Community instruments relating to services pursuant to which a provider is subject to the application of a law other than that of the Member State of establishment. Moreover, by way of exception, measures against a given provider should also be adopted in certain individual cases and under certain strict procedural and substantive conditions. In addition, any restriction of the free movement of services should be permitted, by way of exception, only if it is consistent with fundamental rights which form an integral part of the general principles of law enshrined in the Community legal order.\n(84)\nThe derogation from the provision on the freedom to provide services concerning postal services should cover both activities reserved to the universal service provider and other postal services.\n(85)\nThe derogation from the provision on the freedom to provide services relating to the judicial recovery of debts and the reference to a possible future harmonisation instrument should concern only the access to and the exercise of activities which consist, notably, in bringing actions before a court relating to the recovery of debts.\n(86)\nThis Directive should not affect terms and conditions of employment which, pursuant to Directive 96/71/ECof the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 1996 concerning the posting of workers in the framework of the provision of services (19), apply to workers posted to provide a service in the territory of another Member State. In such cases, Directive 96/71/EC stipulates that providers have to comply with terms and conditions of employment in a listed number of areas applicable in the Member State where the service is provided. These are: maximum work periods and minimum rest periods, minimum paid annual holidays, minimum rates of pay, including overtime rates, the conditions of hiring out of workers, in particular the protection of workers hired out by temporary employment undertakings, health, safety and hygiene at work, protective measures with regard to the terms and conditions of employment of pregnant women or women who have recently given birth and of children and young people and equality of treatment between men and women and other provisions on non-discrimination. This not only concerns terms and conditions of employment which are laid down by law but also those laid down in collective agreements or arbitration awards that are officially declared or de facto universally applicable within the meaning of Directive 96/71/EC. Moreover, this Directive should not prevent Member States from applying terms and conditions of employment on matters other than those listed in Article 3(1) of Directive 96/71/EC on the grounds of public policy.\n(87)\nNeither should this Directive affect terms and conditions of employment in cases where the worker employed for the provision of a cross-border service is recruited in the Member State where the service is provided. Furthermore, this Directive should not affect the right for the Member State where the service is provided to determine the existence of an employment relationship and the distinction between self-employed persons and employed persons, including ‘false self-employed persons’. In that respect the essential characteristic of an employment relationship within the meaning of Article 39 of the Treaty should be the fact that for a certain period of time a person provides services for and under the direction of another person in return for which he receives remuneration. Any activity which a person performs outside a relationship of subordination must be classified as an activity pursued in a self-employed capacity for the purposes of Articles 43 and 49 of the Treaty.\n(88)\nThe provision on the freedom to provide services should not apply in cases where, in conformity with Community law, an activity is reserved in a Member State to a particular profession, for example requirements which reserve the provision of legal advice to lawyers.\n(89)\nThe derogation from the provision on the freedom to provide services concerning matters relating to the registration of vehicles leased in a Member State other than that in which they are used follows from the case law of the Court of Justice, which has recognised that a Member State may impose such an obligation, in accordance with proportionate conditions, in the case of vehicles used on its territory. That exclusion does not cover occasional or temporary rental.\n(90)\nContractual relations between the provider and the client as well as between an employer and employee should not be subject to this Directive. The applicable law regarding the contractual or non contractual obligations of the provider should be determined by the rules of private international law.\n(91)\nIt is necessary to afford Member States the possibility, exceptionally and on a case-by-case basis, of taking measures which derogate from the provision on the freedom to provide services in respect of a provider established in another Member State on grounds of the safety of services. However, it should be possible to take such measures only in the absence of harmonisation at Community level.\n(92)\nRestrictions on the free movement of services, contrary to this Directive, may arise not only from measures applied to providers, but also from the many barriers to the use of services by recipients, especially consumers. This Directive mentions, by way of illustration, certain types of restriction applied to a recipient wishing to use a service performed by a provider established in another Member State. This also includes cases where recipients of a service are under an obligation to obtain authorisation from or to make a declaration to their competent authorities in order to receive a service from a provider established in another Member State. This does not concern general authorisation schemes which also apply to the use of a service supplied by a provider established in the same Member State.\n(93)\nThe concept of financial assistance provided for the use of a particular service should not apply to systems of aids granted by Member States, in particular in the social field or in the cultural sector, which are covered by Community rules on competition, nor to general financial assistance not linked to the use of a particular service, for example grants or loans to students.\n(94)\nIn accordance with the Treaty rules on the free movement of services, discrimination on grounds of the nationality of the recipient or national or local residence is prohibited. Such discrimination could take the form of an obligation, imposed only on nationals of another Member State, to supply original documents, certified copies, a certificate of nationality or official translations of documents in order to benefit from a service or from more advantageous terms or prices. However, the prohibition of discriminatory requirements should not preclude the reservation of advantages, especially as regards tariffs, to certain recipients, if such reservation is based on legitimate and objective criteria.\n(95)\nThe principle of non-discrimination within the internal market means that access by a recipient, and especially by a consumer, to a service on offer to the public may not be denied or restricted by application of a criterion, included in general conditions made available to the public, relating to the recipient's nationality or place of residence. It does not follow that it will be unlawful discrimination if provision were made in such general conditions for different tariffs and conditions to apply to the provision of a service, where those tariffs, prices and conditions are justified for objective reasons that can vary from country to country, such as additional costs incurred because of the distance involved or the technical characteristics of the provision of the service, or different market conditions, such as higher or lower demand influenced by seasonality, different vacation periods in the Member States and pricing by different competitors, or extra risks linked to rules differing from those of the Member State of establishment. Neither does it follow that the non-provision of a service to a consumer for lack of the required intellectual property rights in a particular territory would constitute unlawful discrimination.\n(96)\nIt is appropriate to provide that, as one of the means by which the provider may make the information which he is obliged to supply easily accessible to the recipient, he supply his electronic address, including that of his website. Furthermore, the obligation to make available certain information in the provider's information documents which present his services in detail should not cover commercial communications of a general nature, such as advertising, but rather documents giving a detailed description of the services proposed, including documents on a website.\n(97)\nIt is necessary to provide in this Directive for certain rules on high quality of services, ensuring in particular information and transparency requirements. These rules should apply both in cases of cross border provision of services between Member States and in cases of services provided in a Member State by a provider established there, without imposing unnecessary burdens on SMEs. They should not in any way prevent Member States from applying, in conformity with this Directive and other Community law, additional or different quality requirements.\n(98)\nAny operator providing services involving a direct and particular health, safety or financial risk for the recipient or a third person should, in principle, be covered by appropriate professional liability insurance, or by another form of guarantee which is equivalent or comparable, which means, in particular, that such an operator should as a general rule have adequate insurance cover for services provided in one or more Member States other than the Member State of establishment.\n(99)\nThe insurance or guarantee should be appropriate to the nature and extent of the risk. Therefore it should be necessary for the provider to have cross-border cover only if that provider actually provides services in other Member States. Member States should not lay down more detailed rules concerning the insurance cover and fix for example minimum thresholds for the insured sum or limits on exclusions from the insurance cover. Providers and insurance companies should maintain the necessary flexibility to negotiate insurance policies precisely targeted to the nature and extent of the risk. Furthermore, it is not necessary for an obligation of appropriate insurance to be laid down by law. It should be sufficient if an insurance obligation is part of the ethical rules laid down by professional bodies. Finally, there should be no obligation for insurance companies to provide insurance cover.\n(100)\nIt is necessary to put an end to total prohibitions on commercial communications by the regulated professions, not by removing bans on the content of a commercial communication but rather by removing those bans which, in a general way and for a given profession, forbid one or more forms of commercial communication, such as a ban on all advertising in one or more given media. As regards the content and methods of commercial communication, it is necessary to encourage professionals to draw up, in accordance with Community law, codes of conduct at Community level.\n(101)\nIt is necessary and in the interest of recipients, in particular consumers, to ensure that it is possible for providers to offer multidisciplinary services and that restrictions in this regard be limited to what is necessary to ensure the impartiality, independence and integrity of the regulated professions. This does not affect restrictions or prohibitions on carrying out particular activities which aim at ensuring independence in cases in which a Member State entrusts a provider with a particular task, notably in the area of urban development, nor should it affect the application of competition rules.\n(102)\nIn order to increase transparency and promote assessments based on comparable criteria with regard to the quality of the services offered and supplied to recipients, it is important that information on the meaning of quality labels and other distinctive marks relating to these services be easily accessible. That obligation of transparency is particularly important in areas such as tourism, especially the hotel business, in which the use of a system of classification is widespread. Moreover, it is appropriate to examine the extent to which European standardisation could facilitate compatibility and quality of services. European standards are drawn up by the European standards-setting bodies, the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN), the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardisation (CENELEC) and the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI). Where appropriate, the Commission may, in accordance with the procedures laid down in Directive 98/34/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 June 1998 laying down a procedure for the provision of information in the field of technical standards and regulations (20) and of rules on Information Society services, issue a mandate for the drawing up of specific European standards.\n(103)\nIn order to solve potential problems with compliance with judicial decisions, it is appropriate to provide that Member States recognise equivalent guarantees lodged with institutions or bodies such as banks, insurance providers or other financial services providers established in another Member State.\n(104)\nThe development of a network of Member States' consumer protection authorities, which is the subject of Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004, complements the cooperation provided for in this Directive. The application of consumer protection legislation in cross-border cases, in particular with regard to new marketing and selling practices, as well as the need to remove certain specific obstacles to cooperation in this field, necessitates a greater degree of cooperation between Member States. In particular, it is necessary in this area to ensure that Member States require the cessation of illegal practices by operators in their territory who target consumers in another Member State.\n(105)\nAdministrative cooperation is essential to make the internal market in services function properly. Lack of cooperation between Member States results in proliferation of rules applicable to providers or duplication of controls for cross-border activities, and can also be used by rogue traders to avoid supervision or to circumvent applicable national rules on services. It is, therefore, essential to provide for clear, legally binding obligations for Member States to cooperate effectively.\n(106)\nFor the purposes of the Chapter on administrative cooperation, ‘supervision’ should cover activities such as monitoring and fact finding, problem solving, enforcement and imposition of sanctions and subsequent follow-up activities.\n(107)\nIn normal circumstances mutual assistance should take place directly between competent authorities. The liaison points designated by Member States should be required to facilitate this process only in the event of difficulties being encountered, for instance if assistance is required to identify the relevant competent authority.\n(108)\nCertain obligations of mutual assistance should apply to all matters covered by this Directive, including those relating to cases where a provider establishes in another Member State. Other obligations of mutual assistance should apply only in cases of cross-border provision of services, where the provision on the freedom to provide services applies. A further set of obligations should apply in all cases of cross-border provision of services, including areas not covered by the provision on the freedom to provide services. Cross-border provision of services should include cases where services are provided at a distance and where the recipient travels to the Member State of establishment of the provider in order to receive services.\n(109)\nIn cases where a provider moves temporarily to a Member State other than the Member State of establishment, it is necessary to provide for mutual assistance between those two Member States so that the former can carry out checks, inspections and enquiries at the request of the Member State of establishment or carry out such checks on its own initiative if these are merely factual checks.\n(110)\nIt should not be possible for Member States to circumvent the rules laid down in this Directive, including the provision on the freedom to provide services, by conducting checks, inspections or investigations which are discriminatory or disproportionate.\n(111)\nThe provisions of this Directive concerning exchange of information regarding the good repute of providers should not pre-empt initiatives in the area of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters, in particular on the exchange of information between law enforcement authorities of the Member States and on criminal records.\n(112)\nCooperation between Member States requires a well-functioning electronic information system in order to allow competent authorities easily to identify their relevant interlocutors in other Member States and to communicate in an efficient way.\n(113)\nIt is necessary to provide that the Member States, in cooperation with the Commission, are to encourage interested parties to draw up codes of conduct at Community level, aimed, in particular, at promoting the quality of services and taking into account the specific nature of each profession. Those codes of conduct should comply with Community law, especially competition law. They should be compatible with legally binding rules governing professional ethics and conduct in the Member States.\n(114)\nMember States should encourage the setting up of codes of conduct, in particular, by professional bodies, organisations and associations at Community level. These codes of conduct should include, as appropriate to the specific nature of each profession, rules for commercial communications relating to the regulated professions and rules of professional ethics and conduct of the regulated professions which aim, in particular, at ensuring independence, impartiality and professional secrecy. In addition, the conditions to which the activities of estate agents are subject should be included in such codes of conduct. Member States should take accompanying measures to encourage professional bodies, organisations and associations to implement at national level the codes of conduct adopted at Community level.\n(115)\nCodes of conduct at Community level are intended to set minimum standards of conduct and are complementary to Member States' legal requirements. They do not preclude Member States, in accordance with Community law, from taking more stringent measures in law or national professional bodies from providing for greater protection in their national codes of conduct.\n(116)\nSince the objectives of this Directive, namely the elimination of barriers to the freedom of establishment for providers in the Member States and to the free provision of services between Member States, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale of the action, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.\n(117)\nThe measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (21).\n(118)\nIn accordance with paragraph 34 of the Interinstitutional Agreement on better law-making (22), Member States are encouraged to draw up, for themselves and in the interest of the Community, their own tables, which will, as far as possible, illustrate the correlation between the Directive and the transposition measures, and to make them public,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nCHAPTER I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\n1. This Directive establishes general provisions facilitating the exercise of the freedom of establishment for service providers and the free movement of services, while maintaining a high quality of services.\n2. This Directive does not deal with the liberalisation of services of general economic interest, reserved to public or private entities, nor with the privatisation of public entities providing services.\n3. This Directive does not deal with the abolition of monopolies providing services nor with aids granted by Member States which are covered by Community rules on competition.\nThis Directive does not affect the freedom of Member States to define, in conformity with Community law, what they consider to be services of general economic interest, how those services should be organised and financed, in compliance with the State aid rules, and what specific obligations they should be subject to.\n4. This Directive does not affect measures taken at Community level or at national level, in conformity with Community law, to protect or promote cultural or linguistic diversity or media pluralism.\n5. This Directive does not affect Member States' rules of criminal law. However, Member States may not restrict the freedom to provide services by applying criminal law provisions which specifically regulate or affect access to or exercise of a service activity in circumvention of the rules laid down in this Directive.\n6. This Directive does not affect labour law, that is any legal or contractual provision concerning employment conditions, working conditions, including health and safety at work and the relationship between employers and workers, which Member States apply in accordance with national law which respects Community law. Equally, this Directive does not affect the social security legislation of the Member States.\n7. This Directive does not affect the exercise of fundamental rights as recognised in the Member States and by Community law. Nor does it affect the right to negotiate, conclude and enforce collective agreements and to take industrial action in accordance with national law and practices which respect Community law.\nArticle 2\nScope\n1. This Directive shall apply to services supplied by providers established in a Member State.\n2. This Directive shall not apply to the following activities:\n(a)\nnon-economic services of general interest;\n(b)\nfinancial services, such as banking, credit, insurance and re-insurance, occupational or personal pensions, securities, investment funds, payment and investment advice, including the services listed in Annex I to Directive 2006/48/EC;\n(c)\nelectronic communications services and networks, and associated facilities and services, with respect to matters covered by Directives 2002/19/EC, 2002/20/EC, 2002/21/EC, 2002/22/EC and 2002/58/EC;\n(d)\nservices in the field of transport, including port services, falling within the scope of Title V of the Treaty;\n(e)\nservices of temporary work agencies;\n(f)\nhealthcare services whether or not they are provided via healthcare facilities, and regardless of the ways in which they are organised and financed at national level or whether they are public or private;\n(g)\naudiovisual services, including cinematographic services, whatever their mode of production, distribution and transmission, and radio broadcasting;\n(h)\ngambling activities which involve wagering a stake with pecuniary value in games of chance, including lotteries, gambling in casinos and betting transactions;\n(i)\nactivities which are connected with the exercise of official authority as set out in Article 45 of the Treaty;\n(j)\nsocial services relating to social housing, childcare and support of families and persons permanently or temporarily in need which are provided by the State, by providers mandated by the State or by charities recognised as such by the State;\n(k)\nprivate security services;\n(l)\nservices provided by notaries and bailiffs, who are appointed by an official act of government.\n3. This Directive shall not apply to the field of taxation.\nArticle 3\nRelationship with other provisions of Community law\n1. If the provisions of this Directive conflict with a provision of another Community act governing specific aspects of access to or exercise of a service activity in specific sectors or for specific professions, the provision of the other Community act shall prevail and shall apply to those specific sectors or professions. These include:\n(a)\nDirective 96/71/EC;\n(b)\nRegulation (EEC) No 1408/71;\n(c)\nCouncil Directive 89/552/EEC of 3 October 1989 on the coordination of certain provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in Member States concerning the pursuit of television broadcasting activities (23);\n(d)\nDirective 2005/36/EC.\n2. This Directive does not concern rules of private international law, in particular rules governing the law applicable to contractual and non contractual obligations, including those which guarantee that consumers benefit from the protection granted to them by the consumer protection rules laid down in the consumer legislation in force in their Member State.\n3. Member States shall apply the provisions of this Directive in compliance with the rules of the Treaty on the right of establishment and the free movement of services.\nArticle 4\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Directive, the following definitions shall apply:\n1)\n‘service’ means any self-employed economic activity, normally provided for remuneration, as referred to in Article 50 of the Treaty;\n2)\n‘provider’ means any natural person who is a national of a Member State, or any legal person as referred to in Article 48 of the Treaty and established in a Member State, who offers or provides a service;\n3)\n‘recipient’ means any natural person who is a national of a Member State or who benefits from rights conferred upon him by Community acts, or any legal person as referred to in Article 48 of the Treaty and established in a Member State, who, for professional or non-professional purposes, uses, or wishes to use, a service;\n4)\n‘Member State of establishment’ means the Member State in whose territory the provider of the service concerned is established;\n5)\n‘establishment’ means the actual pursuit of an economic activity, as referred to in Article 43 of the Treaty, by the provider for an indefinite period and through a stable infrastructure from where the business of providing services is actually carried out;\n6)\n‘authorisation scheme’ means any procedure under which a provider or recipient is in effect required to take steps in order to obtain from a competent authority a formal decision, or an implied decision, concerning access to a service activity or the exercise thereof;\n7)\n‘requirement’ means any obligation, prohibition, condition or limit provided for in the laws, regulations or administrative provisions of the Member States or in consequence of case-law, administrative practice, the rules of professional bodies, or the collective rules of professional associations or other professional organisations, adopted in the exercise of their legal autonomy; rules laid down in collective agreements negotiated by the social partners shall not as such be seen as requirements within the meaning of this Directive;\n8)\n‘overriding reasons relating to the public interest’ means reasons recognised as such in the case law of the Court of Justice, including the following grounds: public policy; public security; public safety; public health; preserving the financial equilibrium of the social security system; the protection of consumers, recipients of services and workers; fairness of trade transactions; combating fraud; the protection of the environment and the urban environment; the health of animals; intellectual property; the conservation of the national historic and artistic heritage; social policy objectives and cultural policy objectives;\n9)\n‘competent authority’ means any body or authority which has a supervisory or regulatory role in a Member State in relation to service activities, including, in particular, administrative authorities, including courts acting as such, professional bodies, and those professional associations or other professional organisations which, in the exercise of their legal autonomy, regulate in a collective manner access to service activities or the exercise thereof;\n10)\n‘Member State where the service is provided’ means the Member State where the service is supplied by a provider established in another Member State;\n11)\n‘regulated profession’ means a professional activity or a group of professional activities as referred to in Article 3(1)(a) of Directive 2005/36/EC;\n12)\n‘commercial communication’ means any form of communication designed to promote, directly or indirectly, the goods, services or image of an undertaking, organisation or person engaged in commercial, industrial or craft activity or practising a regulated profession.

Member States shall examine the procedures and formalities applicable to access to a service activity and to the exercise thereof. Where procedures and formalities examined under this paragraph are not sufficiently simple, Member States shall simplify them.\n2. The Commission may introduce harmonised forms at Community level, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 40(2). These forms shall be equivalent to certificates, attestations and any other documents required of a provider.\n3. Where Member States require a provider or recipient to supply a certificate, attestation or any other document proving that a requirement has been satisfied, they shall accept any document from another Member State which serves an equivalent purpose or from which it is clear that the requirement in question has been satisfied. They may not require a document from another Member State to be produced in its original form, or as a certified copy or as a certified translation, save in the cases provided for in other Community instruments or where such a requirement is justified by an overriding reason relating to the public interest, including public order and security.\nThe first subparagraph shall not affect the right of Member States to require non-certified translations of documents in one of their official languages.\n4. Paragraph 3 shall not apply to the documents referred to in Article 7(2) and 50 of Directive 2005/36/EC, in Articles 45(3), 46, 49 and 50 of Directive 2004/18/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 on the coordination of procedures for the award of public works contracts, public supply contracts and public service contracts (24), in Article 3(2) of Directive 98/5/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 1998 to facilitate practice of the profession of lawyer on a permanent basis in a Member State other than that in which the qualification was obtained (25), in the First Council Directive 68/151/EEC of 9 March 1968 on coordination of safeguards which, for the protection of the interests of members and others, are required by Member States of companies within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 58 of the Treaty, with a view to making such safeguards equivalent throughout the Community (26) and in the Eleventh Council Directive 89/666/EECof 21 December 1989 concerning disclosure requirements in respect of branches opened in a Member State by certain types of company governed by the law of another State (27).\nArticle 6\nPoints of single contact\n1. Member States shall ensure that it is possible for providers to complete the following procedures and formalities through points of single contact:\n(a)\nall procedures and formalities needed for access to his service activities, in particular, all declarations, notifications or applications necessary for authorisation from the competent authorities, including applications for inclusion in a register, a roll or a database, or for registration with a professional body or association;\n(b)\nany applications for authorisation needed to exercise his service activities.\n2. The establishment of points of single contact shall be without prejudice to the allocation of functions and powers among the authorities within national systems.\nArticle 7\nRight to information\n1. Member States shall ensure that the following information is easily accessible to providers and recipients through the points of single contact:\n(a)\nrequirements applicable to providers established in their territory, in particular those requirements concerning the procedures and formalities to be completed in order to access and to exercise service activities;\n(b)\nthe contact details of the competent authorities enabling the latter to be contacted directly, including the details of those authorities responsible for matters concerning the exercise of service activities;\n(c)\nthe means of, and conditions for, accessing public registers and databases on providers and services;\n(d)\nthe means of redress which are generally available in the event of dispute between the competent authorities and the provider or the recipient, or between a provider and a recipient or between providers;\n(e)\nthe contact details of the associations or organisations, other than the competent authorities, from which providers or recipients may obtain practical assistance.\n2. Member States shall ensure that it is possible for providers and recipients to receive, at their request, assistance from the competent authorities, consisting in information on the way in which the requirements referred to in point (a) of paragraph 1 are generally interpreted and applied. Where appropriate, such advice shall include a simple step-by-step guide. The information shall be provided in plain and intelligible language.\n3. Member States shall ensure that the information and assistance referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 are provided in a clear and unambiguous manner, that they are easily accessible at a distance and by electronic means and that they are kept up to date.\n4. Member States shall ensure that the points of single contact and the competent authorities respond as quickly as possible to any request for information or assistance as referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 and, in cases where the request is faulty or unfounded, inform the applicant accordingly without delay.\n5. Member States and the Commission shall take accompanying measures in order to encourage points of single contact to make the information provided for in this Article available in other Community languages. This does not interfere with Member States' legislation on the use of languages.\n6. The obligation for competent authorities to assist providers and recipients does not require those authorities to provide legal advice in individual cases but concerns only general information on the way in which requirements are usually interpreted or applied.\nArticle 8\nProcedures by electronic means\n1. Member States shall ensure that all procedures and formalities relating to access to a service activity and to the exercise thereof may be easily completed, at a distance and by electronic means, through the relevant point of single contact and with the relevant competent authorities.\n2. Paragraph 1 shall not apply to the inspection of premises on which the service is provided or of equipment used by the provider or to physical examination of the capability or of the personal integrity of the provider or of his responsible staff.\n3. The Commission shall, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 40(2), adopt detailed rules for the implementation of paragraph 1 of this Article with a view to facilitating the interoperability of information systems and use of procedures by electronic means between Member States, taking into account common standards developed at Community level.\nCHAPTER III\nFREEDOM OF ESTABLISHMENT FOR PROVIDERS\nSECTION 1\nAuthorisations\nArticle 9\nAuthorisation schemes\n1. Member States shall not make access to a service activity or the exercise thereof subject to an authorisation scheme unless the following conditions are satisfied:\n(a)\nthe authorisation scheme does not discriminate against the provider in question;\n(b)\nthe need for an authorisation scheme is justified by an overriding reason relating to the public interest;\n(c)\nthe objective pursued cannot be attained by means of a less restrictive measure, in particular because an a posteriori inspection would take place too late to be genuinely effective.\n2. In the report referred to in Article 39(1), Member States shall identify their authorisation schemes and give reasons showing their compatibility with paragraph 1 of this Article.\n3. This section shall not apply to those aspects of authorisation schemes which are governed directly or indirectly by other Community instruments.\nArticle 10\nCondiations for the granting of authorisation\n1. Authorisation schemes shall be based on criteria which preclude the competent authorities from exercising their power of assessment in an arbitrary manner.\n2. The criteria referred to in paragraph 1 shall be:\n(a)\nnon-discriminatory;\n(b)\njustified by an overriding reason relating to the public interest;\n(c)\nproportionate to that public interest objective;\n(d)\nclear and unambiguous;\n(e)\nobjective;\n(f)\nmade public in advance;\n(g)\ntransparent and accessible.\n3. The conditions for granting authorisation for a new establishment shall not duplicate requirements and controls which are equivalent or essentially comparable as regards their purpose to which the provider is already subject in another Member State or in the same Member State. The liaison points referred to in Article 28(2) and the provider shall assist the competent authority by providing any necessary information regarding those requirements.\n4. The authorisation shall enable the provider to have access to the service activity, or to exercise that activity, throughout the national territory, including by means of setting up agencies, subsidiaries, branches or offices, except where an authorisation for each individual establishment or a limitation of the authorisation to a certain part of the territory is justified by an overriding reason relating to the public interest.\n5. The authorisation shall be granted as soon as it is established, in the light of an appropriate examination, that the conditions for authorisation have been met.\n6. Except in the case of the granting of an authorisation, any decision from the competent authorities, including refusal or withdrawal of an authorisation, shall be fully reasoned and shall be open to challenge before the courts or other instances of appeal.\n7. This Article shall not call into question the allocation of the competences, at local or regional level, of the Member States' authorities granting authorisations.\nArticle 11\nDuration of authorisation\n1. An authorisation granted to a provider shall not be for a limited period, except where:\n(a)\nthe authorisation is being automatically renewed or is subject only to the continued fulfilment of requirements;\n(b)\nthe number of available authorisations is limited by an overriding reason relating to the public interest;\nor\n(c)\na limited authorisation period can be justified by an overriding reason relating to the public interest.\n2. Paragraph 1 shall not concern the maximum period before the end of which the provider must actually commence his activity after receiving authorisation.\n3. Member States shall require a provider to inform the relevant point of single contact provided for in Article 6 of the following changes:\n(a)\nthe creation of subsidiaries whose activities fall within the scope of the authorisation scheme;\n(b)\nchanges in his situation which result in the conditions for authorisation no longer being met.\n4. This Article shall be without prejudice to the Member States' ability to revoke authorisations, when the conditions for authorisation are no longer met.\nArticle 12\nSelection from among several candidates\n1. Where the number of authorisations available for a given activity is limited because of the scarcity of available natural resources or technical capacity, Member States shall apply a selection procedure to potential candidates which provides full guarantees of impartiality and transparency, including, in particular, adequate publicity about the launch, conduct and completion of the procedure.\n2. In the cases referred to in paragraph 1, authorisation shall be granted for an appropriate limited period and may not be open to automatic renewal nor confer any other advantage on the provider whose authorisation has just expired or on any person having any particular links with that provider.\n3. Subject to paragraph 1 and to Articles 9 and 10, Member States may take into account, in establishing the rules for the selection procedure, considerations of public health, social policy objectives, the health and safety of employees or self-employed persons, the protection of the environment, the preservation of cultural heritage and other overriding reasons relating to the public interest, in conformity with Community law.\nArticle 13\nAuthorisation procedures\n1. Authorisation procedures and formalities shall be clear, made public in advance and be such as to provide the applicants with a guarantee that their application will be dealt with objectively and impartially.\n2. Authorisation procedures and formalities shall not be dissuasive and shall not unduly complicate or delay the provision of the service. They shall be easily accessible and any charges which the applicants may incur from their application shall be reasonable and proportionate to the cost of the authorisation procedures in question and shall not exceed the cost of the procedures.\n3. Authorisation procedures and formalities shall provide applicants with a guarantee that their application will be processed as quickly as possible and, in any event, within a reasonable period which is fixed and made public in advance. The period shall run only from the time when all documentation has been submitted. When justified by the complexity of the issue, the time period may be extended once, by the competent authority, for a limited time. The extension and its duration shall be duly motivated and shall be notified to the applicant before the original period has expired.\n4. Failing a response within the time period set or extended in accordance with paragraph 3, authorisation shall be deemed to have been granted. Different arrangements may nevertheless be put in place, where justified by overriding reasons relating to the public interest, including a legitimate interest of third parties.\n5. All applications for authorisation shall be acknowledged as quickly as possible. The acknowledgement must specify the following:\n(a)\nthe period referred to in paragraph 3;\n(b)\nthe available means of redress;\n(c)\nwhere applicable, a statement that in the absence of a response within the period specified, the authorisation shall be deemed to have been granted.\n6. In the case of an incomplete application, the applicant shall be informed as quickly as possible of the need to supply any additional documentation, as well as of any possible effects on the period referred to in paragraph 3.\n7. When a request is rejected because it fails to comply with the required procedures or formalities, the applicant shall be informed of the rejection as quickly as possible.\nSECTION 2\nRequirements prohibited or subject to evaluation\nArticle 14\nProhibited requirements\nMember States shall not make access to, or the exercise of, a service activity in their territory subject to compliance with any of the following:\n1)\ndiscriminatory requirements based directly or indirectly on nationality or, in the case of companies, the location of the registered office, including in particular:\n(a)\nnationality requirements for the provider, his staff, persons holding the share capital or members of the provider's management or supervisory bodies;\n(b)\na requirement that the provider, his staff, persons holding the share capital or members of the provider's management or supervisory bodies be resident within the territory;\n2)\na prohibition on having an establishment in more than one Member State or on being entered in the registers or enrolled with professional bodies or associations of more than one Member State;\n3)\nrestrictions on the freedom of a provider to choose between a principal or a secondary establishment, in particular an obligation on the provider to have its principal establishment in their territory, or restrictions on the freedom to choose between establishment in the form of an agency, branch or subsidiary;\n4)\nconditions of reciprocity with the Member State in which the provider already has an establishment, save in the case of conditions of reciprocity provided for in Community instruments concerning energy;\n5)\nthe case-by-case application of an economic test making the granting of authorisation subject to proof of the existence of an economic need or market demand, an assessment of the potential or current economic effects of the activity or an assessment of the appropriateness of the activity in relation to the economic planning objectives set by the competent authority; this prohibition shall not concern planning requirements which do not pursue economic aims but serve overriding reasons relating to the public interest;\n6)\nthe direct or indirect involvement of competing operators, including within consultative bodies, in the granting of authorisations or in the adoption of other decisions of the competent authorities, with the exception of professional bodies and associations or other organisations acting as the competent authority; this prohibition shall not concern the consultation of organisations, such as chambers of commerce or social partners, on matters other than individual applications for authorisation, or a consultation of the public at large;\n7)\nan obligation to provide or participate in a financial guarantee or to take out insurance from a provider or body established in their territory. This shall not affect the possibility for Member States to require insurance or financial guarantees as such, nor shall it affect requirements relating to the participation in a collective compensation fund, for instance for members of professional bodies or organisations;\n8)\nan obligation to have been pre-registered, for a given period, in the registers held in their territory or to have previously exercised the activity for a given period in their territory.\nArticle 15\nRequirements to be evaluated\n1. Member States shall examine whether, under their legal system, any of the requirements listed in paragraph 2 are imposed and shall ensure that any such requirements are compatible with the conditions laid down in paragraph 3. Member States shall adapt their laws, regulations or administrative provisions so as to make them compatible with those conditions.\n2. Member States shall examine whether their legal system makes access to a service activity or the exercise of it subject to compliance with any of the following non-discriminatory requirements:\n(a)\nquantitative or territorial restrictions, in particular in the form of limits fixed according to population or of a minimum geographical distance between providers;\n(b)\nan obligation on a provider to take a specific legal form;\n(c)\nrequirements which relate to the shareholding of a company;\n(d)\nrequirements, other than those concerning matters covered by Directive 2005/36/EC or provided for in other Community instruments, which reserve access to the service activity in question to particular providers by virtue of the specific nature of the activity;\n(e)\na ban on having more than one establishment in the territory of the same State;\n(f)\nrequirements fixing a minimum number of employees;\n(g)\nfixed minimum and/or maximum tariffs with which the provider must comply;\n(h)\nan obligation on the provider to supply other specific services jointly with his service.\n3. Member States shall verify that the requirements referred to in paragraph 2 satisfy the following conditions:\n(a)\nnon-discrimination: requirements must be neither directly nor indirectly discriminatory according to nationality nor, with regard to companies, according to the location of the registered office;\n(b)\nnecessity: requirements must be justified by an overriding reason relating to the public interest;\n(c)\nproportionality: requirements must be suitable for securing the attainment of the objective pursued; they must not go beyond what is necessary to attain that objective and it must not be possible to replace those requirements with other, less restrictive measures which attain the same result.\n4. Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall apply to legislation in the field of services of general economic interest only insofar as the application of these paragraphs does not obstruct the performance, in law or in fact, of the particular task assigned to them.\n5. In the mutual evaluation report provided for in Article 39(1), Member States shall specify the following:\n(a)\nthe requirements that they intend to maintain and the reasons why they consider that those requirements comply with the conditions set out in paragraph 3;\n(b)\nthe requirements which have been abolished or made less stringent.\n6. From 28 December 2006 Member States shall not introduce any new requirement of a kind listed in paragraph 2, unless that requirement satisfies the conditions laid down in paragraph 3.\n7. Member States shall notify the Commission of any new laws, regulations or administrative provisions which set requirements as referred to in paragraph 6, together with the reasons for those requirements. The Commission shall communicate the provisions concerned to the other Member States.

Provisional measures (1) The Commission, by Regulation (EEC) No 2799/92 (2), imposed a provisional anti-dumping duty on imports of dead-burned (sintered) magnesia originating in the People's Republic of China and falling within CN code 2519 90 30, hereafter referred to as 'dead-burned magnesite'.\nB. Subsequent procedure (2) Following the imposition of the provisional anti-dumping duty, five Chinese exporters and some independent importers requested and were granted an opportunity to be heard by the Commission. They also made written submissions making known their views on the findings as did other independent importers, some end users and the Chinese authorities.\n(3) Parties were also informed of the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which it was intended to recommend the imposition of definitive duties. They were also granted a period within which they could make representations subsequent to these disclosures.\n(4) The oral and written comments submitted by the parties were considered and, where appropriate, the Commission's findings were modified to take account of them.\nC. Product under consideration - Like product (5) Certain Chinese exporters, independent importers and end users have repeated the argument that dead-burned magnesite originating in the Community and elsewhere is not a like product to that originating in the People's Republic of China. In this respect, the Chinese exporters proposed that an independent technical expert be appointed by the Commission to determine the question of whether or not Chinese dead-burned magnesite is a 'like product' to any other dead-burned magnesite, in terms of the quality of its mineral deposits, the extracting and processing methods, its chemical and physical characteristics and the application of the final product.\n(6) The Commission accepts that an independent expert may provide factual information as to any such differences between Chinese dead-burned magnesite and that from other sources. The existence of these differences is, however, accepted by the Community institutions. It is also not contested that these differences do not alter the fact that the basic physical and chemical characteristics of all types of dead-burned magnesite are identical. Only if these basic physical and technical characteristics were to be different, could it be considered that the different types of dead-burned magnesite are not similar products. The fact that dead-burned magnesite from whatever source can be used interchangeably by end users confirms that it is a like product. It was thus not considered necessary to appoint such an expert for these reasons and for those given in recitals 10, 11 and 12 of Regulation (EEC) No 2799/92.\nThe Council confirms these findings and conclusions.\nD. Dumping (a) Reference country\n(7) In Regulation (EEC) No 2799/92 the Commission found that Turkey was an appropriate reference country for the determination of normal value for the People's Republic of China. After the imposition of provisional duties some of the exporters objected to the use of Turkey as a reference country and proposed Czechoslovakia as being more appropriate because of the nature of its reserves, its processing techniques, and the range of the MgO (magnesium oxide) grades. They argued that the former Czechoslovakia, while being a market economy, has an economic structure closer to that of China.\nThe Commission recalls however that, in accordance with Regulation (EEC) No 1765/82 (1), the former Czechoslovakia cannot be regarded as a market economy during the investigation period of July 1990 to June 1991. According to the provisions of Article 2 (5) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88, prices and costs in such a non-market economy cannot be used as a basis for establishing normal value.\nWhen selecting a market economy country in which normal value can be established, the Commission takes several factors into account. It considers the access to raw materials, the representativity of the market in relation to the quantities exported by the exporting country and whether costs and prices of the product in question in that country are formed by competitive market forces.\nAfter a full examination of conditions in Turkey in the light of the above considerations, the Commission concluded, as in recital 15 of Regulation (EEC) No 2799/92 that Turkey is an appropriate reference country.\nThe Council confirms these findings and conclusions.\n(b) Normal value\n(8) With regard to the price situation in Turkey, the Commission found that the high proportion of sales between related companies made it inappropriate to base normal value on selling prices. However, it was found, as shown in recital 16 of Regulation (EEC) No 2799/92 that the costs of production of the Turkish producer are determined through a process of competitive tendering. Costs of production are thus established in the ordinary course of trade and form an appropriate basis for normal value.\n(9) The Chinese exporters argued, after the imposition of provisional duties, that the normal value as constructed for each MgO grade and as adjusted to take account of differences in conditions between China and Turkey, did not fully reflect the natural advantages of China, where they claimed dead-burned magnesite can be extracted and processed more easily than in Turkey.\nThe Commission, to some extent, agrees with this argument. As far as the differences in the mining and processing methods are concerned, the Commission accepts that for Chinese produced dead-burned magnesite, due to the natural advantages, some cost factors do not exist in China. In Regulation (EEC) No 2799/92 normal value was adjusted to allow beneficiation and sorting processes found in Turkey but not found in China. The Commission now considers that an additional allowance should be made for the ease of access to raw materials in China in comparison with that of Turkey. Therefore, taking into account the actual ore/spoil ratio found in Turkey and the level of adjustment suggested by the Chinese exporters, the costs of extraction have been reduced by 20 %, as compared with those established in Turkey.\nOn this basis, the normal value, as established for the Turkish producer, is considered to reflect the natural advantages in China. The Chinese exporters argued that a further allowance should be made in the light of the claimed proximity of the open cast mines to the kilns in China. In this respect it must be stated that the decision to locate the kilns near to the mines, and to move them as the mines move, is one which is influenced by the non-market cost structure in China and that to make adjustments on this account would be incompatible with the aims of Article 2 (5) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88.\n(10) The normal value thus established is confirmed by the Council.\n(c) Export price\n(11) The Council confirms the method used to establish export prices set out in recital 18 of Regulation (EEC) No 2799/92 as no substantiated comments in this respect were made by interested parties.\nE. Comparison and dumping margin (12) The Chinese exporters argued that Chinese producers use simple, low cost, coke-burning, shaft kilns and that an adjustment of 10 % should be made to reflect lower burning costs in China. The Commission established, however, that the Turkish producer also uses shaft kilns. By way of contrast the Commission accepted that an allowance should be made to reflect the higher cost of the fuel oil used by the Turkish producer and costs of production have thus been reduced by 3 %. A number of importers and end users both before and after the imposition of provisional measures alleged that when importing Chinese dead-burned magnesite they had to carry out themselves operations such as analysis of the product, monitoring of loading of the product and removal of foreign substances. It was alleged that this requires often the use, by the importers, of personnel in China. These operations, in the case of the Turkish producers, are normally done by the producers themselves and do not require any intervention of the purchasers. It was requested by these importers and end users that an allowance under Article 2 (9) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88 should be granted to take account of differences in conditions and terms of sale affecting price comparability. The Commission considers on the basis of the information collected that the request for the allowance is justified. On the basis of the information available from the Turkish producer, these costs have been evaluated to be 6 % of the constructed sales price and, for purposes of the comparison, normal value has been adjusted accordingly.\nNo other observation having been raised by any other party, the findings and conclusions in recital 19 of Regulation (EEC) No 2799/92 are hereby confirmed by the Council.\nThe final examination of the facts showed the existence of dumping, the margin of dumping being equal to the amount by which the normal value exceeds the price for export to the Community. This margin is equal to ECU 47 per tonne.\n(13) For the purpose of the provisional findings the Commission has established a single dumping margin for all Chinese exporters. The cooperating Chinese exporters contested the single dumping margin and argued that the Commission should calculate a dumping margin for each cooperating exporter.\nThe Commission recalls however that, with regard to exports from a non-market economy, individual treatment must remain a strict exception to be applied solely in cases where the producer concerned has provided evidence that it is free to establish export prices without the influence of the State authorities. The State, through its control, could modify the pattern of production and trade, so as to take advantage of the lowest dumping margin and thus undermine the effectiveness of any measures. In this respect, as explained in recital 21 of Regulation (EEC) No 2799/92, these exporters which are State controlled enterprises are not independent of any State influence and are not free in the fixing of their export prices. Therefore only one dumping margin for all Chinese exports has been established. The Council confirms the above findings and conclusions.\nF. Injury (14) The Commission concluded in Regulation (EEC) No 2799/92 (see recitals 22 to 32) that the Community industry had suffered material injury as a result of the dumped imports of dead-burned magnesite originating in the People's Republic of China. Imports of the product concerned from the People's Republic of China increased from 117 000 tonnes in 1988 to over 176 000 tonnes during the investigation period of 1 July 1990 to 30 June 1991, the market share of the Community producers decreased in a growing market and their prices were significantly depressed. All sales by Community producers were loss making or at a low profit level. In this respect no new arguments were put forward by interested parties. The Council, therefore, confirms the Commission findings and conclusions as set out in recital 32 of Regulation (EEC) No 2799/92.\n(15) The Chinese exporters argued that there can be no injury for grades above 92 % MgO as the Community producers of these grades have, allegedly, continually increased sales, production volume and capacity utilization.\nAs established in recital 32 of Regulation (EEC) No 2799/92, the Commission did not find, during its investigation, that Community producers had increased sales, production volume and capacity utilization for these grades. In addition, this argument ignores the fact that according to Article 4 (4) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88 injury has to be established in relation to the Community production of the like product, which consists of all types and grades of dead-burned magnesite which are largely interchangeable. If sales in the Community by the Community producers of certain grades are not affected by dumped imports in an identical way to other grades, this has to be seen in the global context of the Community industry's performance on the Community market for the like product as a whole, which means all types and grades. This argument has, therefore, to be rejected. The Council confirms the above findings and conclusions.\nG. Causation of injury (16) As set out in recitals 33 and 34 of Regulation (EEC) No 2799/92, the Commission found that the Community industry had suffered material injury through the effect of dumped imports within the meaning of Article 4 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88. However, after the imposition of provisional measures, the Chinese exporters and some importers argued that the rising costs of production incurred by Community producers indicated that injury was self-inflicted and not attributable to imports from China. They also argued that injury had been caused by imports from North Korea.\n(17) With regard to the first argument, the Commission did not find that Community producers' costs had risen significantly between 1988 and the investigation period. The worsening financial position of the Community industry was the result of the downward pressure on prices from dumped imports from China while costs remained stable. The Commission, therefore, cannot accept that there was any self-inflicted injury on the part of the Community industry due to rising costs of production and this argument, therefore, has to be rejected.\n(18) With regard to imports from North Korea the Commission notes that China is by far the largest source of imports of dead-burned magnesite into the Community. North Korea accounted for 15 % of imports of dead-burned magnesite into the Community during the reference period, whereas China accounted for 46 % of the imports. Accordingly, while it cannot be excluded that factors other than dumped imports from China also had negative effects on the Community industry, it must be concluded that the very substantial expansion in volume and the low prices of the dumped Chinese exports have been responsible for the fall in market share and deteriorating financial position of the Community producers. These exports, taken in isolation, must, therefore, be considered to have caused material injury to the Community industry.\n(19) The refractory producers argued that imports from China used by them had not caused injury to the Community producers as the Community producers did not offer for sale dead-burned magnesite with the appropriate chemical profile.\nIn this respect, the Commission recalls that all the products imported and the dead-burned magnesite produced by the Community industry are like products having the same basic and identical physical and chemical characteristics and the same applications. The Commission found, in addition, that the Community industry is able to provide all types of magnesite, including those which meet the requirements of the abovementioned users. The fact that, in this specific case, the Community industry could not sell these types of magnesite to these users, while the Chinese exporters could, due to their low prices, is a further indication that the Community industry was injured by the dumped imports from China.\nThe Council confirms the above findings and conclusions.\nH. Duty (20) As far as the amount of the duty is concerned, the Commission established in recital 44 of Regulation (EEC) No 2799/92 that only a duty equal to the full dumping margin (as established in recital 12 of this Regulation), which would bring the Chinese prices up to the normal value, is sufficient to remove the injury, caused by dumping, experienced by the Community industry. No arguments concerning this duty amount were put forward; subsequent to the imposition of the provisional duty, the Council, therefore, confirms the Commission's findings and conclusions in this respect.\nAs far as the form of the duty is concerned, the Commission considers that the structure of a State-controlled economy gives the Chinese exporters considerable room for manoeuvre to further decrease their export prices and such falls in price by Chinese exporters have indeed taken place since 1988. The dead-burned magnesite market is very sensitive to price instability thus the form of the duty should be such as to prevent further price decreases by the Chinese exporters. Therefore, neither a fixed amount of duty nor an ad valorem duty seem to be appropriate.\nIn these circumstances it is considered that a minimum price at which the Chinese magnesite should be sold on the Community market should be established. This minimum price has been calculated on the basis of the weighted average normal value of dead-burned magnesite as established in recital 9, taking into account the adjustments mentioned in recital 12. This minimum price adjusted to cif Community frontier value is ECU 120 per tonne for all grades. Consequently, the duty should be equal to the difference between this minimum price and the net, free at Community frontier price before customs clearance. This is confirmed by the Council.\nI. Community interest (21) In assessing the need for the measures, two basic elements were taken into account. The first is that to prevent distortions of competition arising from unfair commercial practices and thus to re-establish open and fair competition on the Community market is the purpose of anti-dumping measures and is fundamentally in the general Community interest. The second is that, in the particular circumstances of the present proceeding, to refrain from re-establishing a fair market situation would endanger the future existence of the dead-burned magnesite industry since the Community industry is at present unable to generate the profits necessary to continue trading. The Community dead-burned magnesite industry would cease to be a source of technical expertise, employment and investment (see recital 40 of Regulation (EEC) No 2799/92).\n(22) Certain importers and end users argued that any increase in costs for refractory producers would seriously affect their ability to compete with other producers outside the Community.\nThe Commission accepts that this industry is currently facing a difficult trading situation both within and outside the Community which could be exacerbated by increases in the price of dead-burned magnesite. The Commission considers, however, that the impact of the duty in the form of a minimum price per tonne, as established in recital 20, will be such as to enable users of the higher grades to buy dead-burned magnesite at prices which are not significantly higher than those of their competitors outside the Community and thus maintain their competitive position. In addition, in general, while there might be a short term price advantage to users if no duty is imposed, to refrain from establishing fair competition on the Community market would, in the longer term, lead to less competition and higher prices.\n(23) Some importers argued that there was no need to protect the Community industry in respect of supplies of dead-burned magnesite which it cannot deliver.\nWhile it is true that production in the Community is, at present, insufficient to meet demand for the product concerned, the Commission found that the Community industry is currently operating below a reasonable capacity utilization level and has large reserves available. It was only the low priced dumped imports from China which prevented the Community industry from utilizing existing capacity and expanding production facilities. In addition, this argument is based on a mistaken view of the effects of anti-dumping duties. Even with the application of duties, Community consumers will still be able to buy Chinese magnesite at competitive prices. Indeed, as in this proceeding, where the duty is equal to the dumping margin, but lower than the amount required to fully remove the injury, it is only the unfair element of the exporters' price advantage which will be eliminated. There are also many other non-Community suppliers of dead-burned magnesite on the Community market. The Commission sees no danger of any shortage of supply.\n(24) The Chinese exporters repeated the argument that it was not in the Community interest to impose ineffective measures in that anti-dumping duties imposed on Chinese dead-burned magnesite would result in a large increase in low priced imports from North Korea. As indicated in recital 41 of Regulation (EEC) No 2799/92, the Commission would be made aware of Chinese imports being replaced to a large extent by allegedly dumped imports from North Korea and in such circumstances appropriate action would be considered.\n(25) For the reasons given above and in recitals 40 to 43 of Regulation (EEC) No 2799/92 the Commission concludes that the Community interest calls for intervention in this case. The Council confirms the above findings and conclusions.\nJ. Collection of provisional duty (26) The Council considers that it is not appropriate, in view of the change in the form of the duty, in this particular case, to definitively collect the provisional anti-dumping duty,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\n1. A definitive anti-dumping duty is hereby imposed on imports of dead-burned (sintered) magnesia falling within CN code 2519 90 30 originating in the People's Republic of China.\n2. The amount of the duty shall be the difference between ECU 120 per tonne and the net, free-at-Community-frontier price before customs clearance, if this price is lower.\n3. The provisions in force concerning customs duties shall apply.\nArticle 2\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\nDone at Brussels, 6 December 1993.",

The Kyoto Protocol to that Framework Convention agreed at the December 1997 Kyoto Conference makes provision for a reduction in the level of greenhouse gas concentrations.\n(2) Under the Kyoto Protocol, the Community has accepted the target of reducing its emissions during the period 2008 to 2012 in respect of a series of greenhouse gases by 8 % relative to 1990 levels.\n(3) The Kyoto Protocol requires the Parties referred to in Annex I to the Protocol to have made demonstrable progress in achieving their commitments by 2005.\n(4) Decision 93/389/EEC(4) established a mechanism to monitor Community emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases.\n(5) In recognition of the importance of passenger cars as a source of CO2 emissions, the Commission has proposed a Community strategy to reduce CO2 emissions from passenger cars and to improve fuel economy. In its Conclusions of 25 June 1996 the Council welcomed the Commission's approach.\n(6) The European Parliament and the Council have formulated an objective of 120 g/km (5 litres/100 km for petrol engines and 4,5 litres/100 km for diesel engines) as a mean value for CO2 emissions in 2005 (2010 at the latest).\n(7) The Commission is in the process of carrying out studies aimed at drawing up, as soon as possible, appropriate proposals on harmonised procedures for measuring the specific CO2 emissions from vehicles of category N1 pursuant to Annex II to Council Directive 70/156/EEC of 6 February 1970 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the type-approval of motor vehicles and their trailers(5).\n(8) The specific emissions of CO2 from new passenger cars are measured on a harmonised basis in the Community according to the methodology laid down in Council Directive 80/1268/EEC of 16 December 1980 relating to the carbon dioxide emissions and the fuel consumption of motor vehicles(6).\n(9) It is necessary to establish objective procedures to monitor the specific emissions of CO2 from new passenger cars sold throughout the Community in order to verify the effectiveness of the Community strategy, as referred to in the Commission communication of 20 December 1995, as well as the implementation of commitments formally undertaken by car manufacturers' organisations. This Decision will provide such a scheme. The Commission has announced that it will consider as soon as possible the need for a legal framework for the agreements to be entered into in the future with the car manufacturers' organisations including measures to be taken in the event of the failure of such agreements to work.\n(10) For the purpose of this Decision, only official data that is consistent with Directive 70/156/EEC should be collected by the Member States.\n(11) Directive 70/156/EEC provides that manufacturers are to issue a certificate of conformity which must accompany each new passenger car and that Member States are to permit the registration and entry into service of a new passenger car only if it is accompanied by a valid certificate of conformity.\n(12) This Decision is not intended to harmonise national vehicle registration systems but to build on them in order to ensure the compilation of a minimum set of data required to allow the proper functioning of a Community scheme to monitor the average specific emissions of CO2 from new passenger cars.\n(13) It is desirable to include all new alternatively powered passenger cars which fall within the scope of Directive 70/156/EEC.\n(14) Such a monitoring scheme should only apply to those new passenger cars which are to be registered for the first time in the Community and have not been registered previously elsewhere.\n(15) It is necessary to maintain contacts between the Commission and Member States as regards the control of quality of data in order to assure an adequate implementation of this Decision,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\nArticle 1\nThis Decision establishes a scheme to monitor the average specific emissions of CO2 from new passenger cars registered in the Community. It applies only to those passenger cars which are being registered in the Community for the first time and have not been registered previously elsewhere.\nArticle 2\nFor the purposes of this Decision:\n1. \"passenger car\" means any motor vehicle of category M1, as defined in Annex II to Directive 70/156/EEC and which falls within the scope of Directive 80/1268/EEC. It does not include vehicles falling under the scope of Directive 92/61/EEC(7) and special purpose vehicles as defined in the second indent of Article 4(1)(a) of Directive 70/156/EEC;\n2. \"newly registered car\" means a passenger car registered for the first time in the Community. It specifically excludes those vehicles which are re-registered in a second Member State or have been registered previously outside the Community;\n3. \"certificate of conformity\" means the certificate, referred to in Article 6 of Directive 70/156/EEC;\n4. \"specific emissions of CO2\" means those of a given passenger car, measured in accordance with Directive 80/1268/EEC and set out in Annex VIII to Directive 70/156/EEC and attached to type-approval documentation;\n5. \"manufacturer\" means the person or body responsible to the approval authority for all aspects of the type-approval process and for ensuring conformity of production. It is not essential that the person or body is directly involved in all stages of the construction of the vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit which is the subject of the approval process;\n6. \"make\" means the trade name of the manufacturer and is that which appears on the certificate of conformity and the type-approval documentation;\n7. \"maximum net power of new passenger cars\" means the maximum engine power stated on the certificate of conformity and the type-approval documentation and measured in accordance with Directive 80/1269/EEC(8);\n8. \"mass\" means the mass of the car with bodywork in running order as stated in the certificate of conformity and the type-approval documentation, and defined in Section 2.6 of Annex I to Directive 70/156/EEC;\n9. \"engine capacity\" means the engine capacity as stated on the certificate of conformity and the type-approval documentation;\n10. \"fuel type\" means the fuel for which the car was originally type-approved and is that which appears on the certificate of conformity and the type-approval documentation;\n11. \"registration file\" means an electronic file containing information relating to the registration of an individual passenger car;\n12. \"type\", \"variant\" and \"version\" mean the differentiated vehicles of a given make that are declared by the manufacturer, as described in Annex II(B) to Directive 70/156/EEC, and uniquely identified by type, variant and version alphanumeric characters;\n13. \"alternatively powered vehicle\" means any motor vehicle of category M1 as defined in Annex II (B) to Directive 70/156/EEC and which does not fall under the scope of Directive 80/1268/EEC;\n14. \"type-approval documentation\" means the information package containing the information folder, type-approval certificate and test results that are circulated between the national type-approval authorities in accordance with Article 4(5) and (6) of Directive 70/156/EEC.\nArticle 3\n1. For the purposes of establishing the scheme referred to in Article 1, Member States shall collect the information described in Annex I for each car referred to in that Article which is registered in their territory.\n2. Member States shall be permitted to take the information referred to in paragraph 1 from either Community type-approval documentation or the certificate of conformity.\n3. Member States shall be responsible for the validation and quality of the data that they collect. Member States shall take into consideration the potential sources of error described in Annex II, take steps to minimise those errors and communicate to the Commission an assessment, by statistical analysis or otherwise, of the proportion of incorrect data together with the report referred to in Article 4(4).\n4. Member States shall take steps to improve the quality of the data that they collect and, on request by the Commission, shall inform it thereof. On the basis of this information the Commission may, in consultation with the Member State concerned, propose to that Member State measures to further improve the quality of data which the Member State shall consider. On this basis, the Member State shall inform the Commission of the further steps which, if appropriate, it will take to improve the quality of data.\nArticle 4\n1. In each calendar year Member States shall determine the following according to the methods described in Annex III, both by manufacturer and for the total of all manufacturers:\n(a) for each separate fuel type:\n(i) the total number of newly registered passenger cars, as specified in Annex III(1);\n(ii) the average specific emissions of CO2 for newly registered passenger cars, as specified in Annex III(2);\n(b) for each fuel type and for each distinct CO2 emission category specified in Annex III(3):\n(i) the number of newly registered passenger cars;\n(ii) the average specific emissions of CO2, as specified in Annex III(3), second subparagraph;\n(c) for each fuel type and for each distinct mass category specified in Annex III(4):\n(i) the number of newly registered passenger cars;\n(ii) the average specific emissions of CO2, as specified in Annex III(4), third subparagraph;\n(iii) the average mass, as specified in Annex III(4), second subparagraph(9);\n(d) for each fuel type, and for each distinct maximum net power category specified in Annex III(5):\n(i) the number of newly registered passenger cars;\n(ii) the average specific emissions of CO2, as specified in Annex III(5), third subparagraph;\n(iii) the average maximum net power, as specified in Annex III(5), second subparagraph;\n(e) for each fuel type and for each distinct engine capacity category specified in Annex III(6):\n(i) the number of newly registered passenger cars;\n(ii) the average specific emissions of CO2, as specified in Annex III(6), third subparagraph;\n(iii) the average engine capacity, as specified in Annex III(6), second subparagraph.\n2. In addition, as regards alternatively powered vehicles, Member States shall determine the number of such vehicles which are registered in their territory.\n3. If the way in which the mass of vehicles registered in their territory is measured varies, Member States shall inform the Commission thereof.\n4. The information referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be transmitted annually to the Commission by the Member States. The first transmission shall take place no later than 1 July 2001. Subsequent transmissions shall be completed by 1 April for the monitoring data collected in the preceding calendar year. The data shall be transmitted in accordance with the format specified in Annex IV.\n5.

Point 7 of the recitals states that the Commission should terminate the Agreement of 28 July 1956 on the setting of through international railway tariffs for the carriage of coal and steel in transit through Swiss territory in accordance with the mandate conferred by the decision taken at the conference of the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States of 17 June 1999, in coordination with the termination of the 1955 Agreement.\n(6) Additional protocols to this Agreement were drawn up on the occasion of the successive enlargements(5). Termination of the Agreement will result in the automatic cancellation of these additional protocols,\nHAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:\nSole Article\nThe Commission, acting as the ECSC High Authority and on behalf of the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States of the ECSC, hereby terminates the Agreement of 28 July 1956 on the setting of through international railway tariffs for the carriage of coal and steel in transit through Swiss territory.\nDone at Brussels, 12 April 2002.",

The effective rates will remain above the minimum Community rates of excise duty laid down in accordance with Council Directive 92/82/EEC of 19 October 1992 on the approximation of the rates of excise duties on mineral oils(2).\n(4) The derogation is sought on environmental grounds - the benefits in terms of air quality are known.\n(5) Low-sulphur diesel complies with the environmental specifications (50 ppm) laid down in Directive 98/70/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 October 1998 relating to the quality of petrol and diesel fuels(3).

The bulk transport in sea-going vessels of liquid oils or fats which are to be processed, and which are intended for or likely to be used for human consumption, is permitted in tanks that are not exclusively reserved for the transport of foodstuffs, subject to the following conditions:\n(a) that, where the oil or fat is transported in a stainless steel tank, or tank lined with epoxy resin or technical equivalent, the immediately previous cargo transported in the tank shall have been a foodstuff, or a cargo from the list of acceptable previous cargoes set out in the Annex;\n(b) that, where the oil or fat is transported in a tank of materials other than those in point (a), the three previous cargoes transported in the tanks shall have been foodstuffs, or from the list of acceptable previous cargoes set out in the Annex.\n2. The bulk transport in sea-going vessels of liquid oils or fats which are not to be further processed, and which are intended for or likely to be used for human consumption, is permitted in tanks that are not exclusively reserved for the transport of foodstuffs, subject to the following conditions:\n(a) that the tank shall be of stainless steel or lined with epoxy resin or technical equivalent;\n(b) that the three previous cargoes transported in the tank shall have been foodstuffs.\nArticle 3\n1. The captain of the sea-going vessel transporting, in tanks, bulk liquid oils and fats intended for or likely to be used for human consumption shall keep accurate documentary evidence relating to the three previous cargoes carried in the tanks concerned, and the effectiveness of the cleaning process applied between these cargoes.\n2. Where the cargo has been trans-shipped, in addition to the documentary evidence required in paragraph 1, the captain of the receiving vessel shall keep accurate documentary evidence that the transport of the bulk liquid oil or fat complied with the provisions in Article 2 during previous shipment and of the effectiveness of the cleaning process used between these cargoes on the other vessel.\n3. Upon request, the captain of the vessel shall provide the competent official control authorities with the documentary evidence described in paragraphs 1 and 2.\nArticle 4\nThis Directive shall be reviewed where one or more Member States, or the Commission, consider that amendments are necessary in order to take account of scientific or technical developments. In any case the Annex shall be reviewed within one year of the entry into force of this Directive.\nArticle 5\nMember States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive on 12 February 1996. They shall immediately inform the Commission thereof.\nWhen Member States adopt these provisions, these shall contain a reference to this Directive or shall be accompanied by such reference at the time of their official publication.

The Community shall contribute towards the costs incurred by the Member States, in response to an annual request to the Commission, for the use of aerial or satellite remote sensing during checks on agricultural areas pursuant to Article 8 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 729/70.\nWithout prejudice to Article 1 (4) of that Regulation, for the purposes of this Regulation 'technical costs' means the costs of:\n- acquiring satellite pictures or aerial photographs,\n- the photo-interpretation of the above,\n- the processing of documents or the use of techniques for locating parcels shown in applications for assistance, for the purpose of surveying the areas under crops and measuring the areas declared.\n2. The co-financing referred to in this Article may only be granted by calendar year for a period of five consecutive years as from the implementation of this Regulation. It shall be granted within the limit of the appropriations allocated for this purpose in the Community budget and may not exceed 50 % of the actual expenditure incurred by the Member State concerned in respect of the relevant budget year.\nThe appropriations available shall be distributed among the Member States in accordance with the scale shown in the Annex, less, where appropriate, expenditure in respect of the costs and work referred to in Article 2. Appropriations in respect of which no application has been made may be re-used in accordance with Article 2, or redistributed, without taking account of the scale, among the Member States which satisfy the requirements laid down by this Regulation.\nHowever, notwithstanding the first subparagraph, and solely for 1994, the Commission may authorize a co-financing rate higher than 50 % on receipt of a duly substantiated request from a Member State, within the budget allocation granted that Member State pursuant to the second subparagraph.\n3. The grant of co-financing shall be conditional on:\n- the submission of a declaration of intent from the Member State to be sent before a date to be determined by the Commission, prior to 1 January of the budget year concerned,\n- the submission before 15 January of a specification setting out in detail the work for which co-financing is requested. The Commission may request that changes be made to it,\n- the consultation of the Commission before 31 March on the award of the contract and on a budget estimate. Irrespective of the form given to this contract by the Member State, the Commission's consent to co-financing must be renewed annually.\nIn all three cases a negative opinion on the part of the Commission or failure to consult within the prescribed period shall mean that co-financing will be refused. The Commission may itself propose a specification to those Member States that desire it. In which case, it shall be considered as approved.\n4. Community payment shall be made upon submission of supporting documents. These shall compromise at least the principal components of the agreement between the Member State and the supplier of services as well as the corresponding proof of payment. In order to be eligible for reimbursement, proof of payment must reach the Commission at the latest by 15 June of the year following the budget year concerned.\n5. The Commission may, on receipt of a duly substantiated request from a Member State, advance part of the amounts covering the annual payments referred to in the preceding paragraph.\n6. The conversion of amounts expressed in ecus and in national currency shall be made by applying the exchange rate in force on the first working day of the calendar year concerned, as published in the C series of the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nArticle 2\nThe Commission may acquire the satellite pictures required for the checks, the list of which shall be agreed with the Member State in accordance with the specification referred to in Article 1 (3), and supply them free of charge to the control agencies, or to suppliers of services authorized by those agencies to represent them. The Commission shall continue to own the pictures supplied and shall recover them on completion of the work. It may also see to it that work is carried out on perfecting the technique and working methods for checking agricultural areas by remote sensing.\nArticle 3\nThe Community co-financing provided for in this Regulation, in the areas referred to in Articles 1 and 2, may not be aggregated with the financial contribution provided for in other Regulations, in particular:\n- Council Regulation (EEC) No 3508/92 of 27 November 1992 establishing an integrated administration and control system for certain Community aid schemes;\n- Council Regulation (EEC) No 307/91 of 4 February 1991 on reinforcing the monitoring of certain expenditure chargeable to the Guarantee Section of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (5).\nArticle 4\nThe Commission shall adopt detailed rules for the application of this Regulation in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 13 of Regulation (EEC) No 729/70.\nArticle 5\nIn Article 10 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 3508/92, the words 'and for the acquisition of aerial photographs or satellite pictures and the analysis thereof' are hereby deleted.\nArticle 6\nThe Commission shall submit a report to the Council on the operation of this Regulation by 1 January 1997.

Unlike the Community industry, which carried out a programme of restructuring and capacity cuts throughout the 1990s, Korean shipyards substantially increased their capacity from 1993 onwards.\n(2) A study of Korean contracts carried out for the Commission by an independent consultant showed that Korean shipyards were pricing well below cost. Such practices have enabled the Korean industry to increase its market share substantially, in particular at the expense of the Community industry, which is currently experiencing severe difficulties. With world prices extremely low, the Community industry saw its market share decline from 25 % in 1998 to 17 % in 1999.\n(3) On 9 November 1999 and on 18 May 2000 the Council, examining the first and the second reports on the situation in world shipbuilding presented by the Commission under Article 12 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1540/98 of 29 June 1998 establishing new rules on aid to shipbuilding(1), noted that the sector was facing a critical situation worldwide and expressed its serious concern at such practices which were severely damaging to the interests of shipyards within the Community. In their Conclusions, the industry ministers called on the Commission to pursue its efforts to establish a level playing field for the sector by immediately engaging the Republic of Korea in constructive consultations with a view to halting the unfair competition.\n(4) As instructed, the Commission accordingly held several rounds of intensive consultations with the Korean Government and negotiated draft Agreed Minutes. Once the Agreed Minutes are signed they will commit the Korean Government to refrain from any direct or indirect intervention to underwrite loss-making Korean shipyards, to apply internationally accepted financial and accounting principles and to ensure that Korean shipyards set prices that reflect market conditions. The Agreed Minutes also provide ad hoc consultation machinery to deal promptly with any issue raised by either of the parties.\n(5) The Agreed Minutes should be approved,\nHAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:\nArticle 1\nThe Agreed Minutes between the European Community and the Government of the Republic of Korea relating to the world shipbuilding market are hereby approved.\nThe text of the Agreed Minutes is attached to this Decision.\nArticle 2\nThe President of the Council is hereby authorised to designate the person empowered to sign the Agreed Minutes in order to bind the Community.\nDone at Luxembourg, 19 June 2000.",

            "text": "Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003\nof 27 November 2003\nconcerning jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and the matters of parental responsibility, repealing Regulation (EC) No 1347/2000\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 61(c) and Article 67(1) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Parliament(2),\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee(3),\nWhereas:\n(1) The European Community has set the objective of creating an area of freedom, security and justice, in which the free movement of persons is ensured. To this end, the Community is to adopt, among others, measures in the field of judicial cooperation in civil matters that are necessary for the proper functioning of the internal market.\n(2) The Tampere European Council endorsed the principle of mutual recognition of judicial decisions as the cornerstone for the creation of a genuine judicial area, and identified visiting rights as a priority.\n(3) Council Regulation (EC) No 1347/2000(4) sets out rules on jurisdiction, recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and matters of parental responsibility for the children of both spouses rendered on the occasion of the matrimonial proceedings. The content of this Regulation was substantially taken over from the Convention of 28 May 1998 on the same subject matter(5).\n(4) On 3 July 2000 France presented an initiative for a Council Regulation on the mutual enforcement of judgments on rights of access to children(6).\n(5) In order to ensure equality for all children, this Regulation covers all decisions on parental responsibility, including measures for the protection of the child, independently of any link with a matrimonial proceeding.\n(6) Since the application of the rules on parental responsibility often arises in the context of matrimonial proceedings, it is more appropriate to have a single instrument for matters of divorce and parental responsibility.\n(7) The scope of this Regulation covers civil matters, whatever the nature of the court or tribunal.\n(8) As regards judgments on divorce, legal separation or marriage annulment, this Regulation should apply only to the dissolution of matrimonial ties and should not deal with issues such as the grounds for divorce, property consequences of the marriage or any other ancillary measures.\n(9) As regards the property of the child, this Regulation should apply only to measures for the protection of the child, i.e. (i) the designation and functions of a person or body having charge of the child's property, representing or assisting the child, and (ii) the administration, conservation or disposal of the child's property. In this context, this Regulation should, for instance, apply in cases where the parents are in dispute as regards the administration of the child's property. Measures relating to the child's property which do not concern the protection of the child should continue to be governed by Council Regulation (EC) No 44/2001 of 22 December 2000 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters(7).\n(10) This Regulation is not intended to apply to matters relating to social security, public measures of a general nature in matters of education or health or to decisions on the right of asylum and on immigration. In addition it does not apply to the establishment of parenthood, since this is a different matter from the attribution of parental responsibility, nor to other questions linked to the status of persons. Moreover, it does not apply to measures taken as a result of criminal offences committed by children.\n(11) Maintenance obligations are excluded from the scope of this Regulation as these are already covered by Council Regulation No 44/2001. The courts having jurisdiction under this Regulation will generally have jurisdiction to rule on maintenance obligations by application of Article 5(2) of Council Regulation No 44/2001.\n(12) The grounds of jurisdiction in matters of parental responsibility established in the present Regulation are shaped in the light of the best interests of the child, in particular on the criterion of proximity. This means that jurisdiction should lie in the first place with the Member State of the child's habitual residence, except for certain cases of a change in the child's residence or pursuant to an agreement between the holders of parental responsibility.\n(13) In the interest of the child, this Regulation allows, by way of exception and under certain conditions, that the court having jurisdiction may transfer a case to a court of another Member State if this court is better placed to hear the case. However, in this case the second court should not be allowed to transfer the case to a third court.\n(14) This Regulation should have effect without prejudice to the application of public international law concerning diplomatic immunities. Where jurisdiction under this Regulation cannot be exercised by reason of the existence of diplomatic immunity in accordance with international law, jurisdiction should be exercised in accordance with national law in a Member State in which the person concerned does not enjoy such immunity.\n(15) Council Regulation (EC) No 1348/2000 of 29 May 2000 on the service in the Member States of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters(8) should apply to the service of documents in proceedings instituted pursuant to this Regulation.\n(16) This Regulation should not prevent the courts of a Member State from taking provisional, including protective measures, in urgent cases, with regard to persons or property situated in that State.\n(17) In cases of wrongful removal or retention of a child, the return of the child should be obtained without delay, and to this end the Hague Convention of 25 October 1980 would continue to apply as complemented by the provisions of this Regulation, in particular Article 11. The courts of the Member State to or in which the child has been wrongfully removed or retained should be able to oppose his or her return in specific, duly justified cases. However, such a decision could be replaced by a subsequent decision by the court of the Member State of habitual residence of the child prior to the wrongful removal or retention. Should that judgment entail the return of the child, the return should take place without any special procedure being required for recognition and enforcement of that judgment in the Member State to or in which the child has been removed or retained.\n(18) Where a court has decided not to return a child on the basis of Article 13 of the 1980 Hague Convention, it should inform the court having jurisdiction or central authority in the Member State where the child was habitually resident prior to the wrongful removal or retention. Unless the court in the latter Member State has been seised, this court or the central authority should notify the parties. This obligation should not prevent the central authority from also notifying the relevant public authorities in accordance with national law.\n(19) The hearing of the child plays an important role in the application of this Regulation, although this instrument is not intended to modify national procedures applicable.\n(20) The hearing of a child in another Member State may take place under the arrangements laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 1206/2001 of 28 May 2001 on cooperation between the courts of the Member States in the taking of evidence in civil or commercial matters(9).\n(21) The recognition and enforcement of judgments given in a Member State should be based on the principle of mutual trust and the grounds for non-recognition should be kept to the minimum required.\n(22) Authentic instruments and agreements between parties that are enforceable in one Member State should be treated as equivalent to \"judgments\" for the purpose of the application of the rules on recognition and enforcement.\n(23) The Tampere European Council considered in its conclusions (point 34) that judgments in the field of family litigation should be \"automatically recognised throughout the Union without any intermediate proceedings or grounds for refusal of enforcement\". This is why judgments on rights of access and judgments on return that have been certified in the Member State of origin in accordance with the provisions of this Regulation should be recognised and enforceable in all other Member States without any further procedure being required. Arrangements for the enforcement of such judgments continue to be governed by national law.\n(24) The certificate issued to facilitate enforcement of the judgment should not be subject to appeal. It should be rectified only where there is a material error, i.e. where it does not correctly reflect the judgment.\n(25) Central authorities should cooperate both in general matter and in specific cases, including for purposes of promoting the amicable resolution of family disputes, in matters of parental responsibility. To this end central authorities shall participate in the European Judicial Network in civil and commercial matters created by Council Decision 2001/470/EC of 28 May 2001 establishing a European Judicial Network in civil and commercial matters(10).\n(26) The Commission should make publicly available and update the lists of courts and redress procedures communicated by the Member States.\n(27) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(11).\n(28) This Regulation replaces Regulation (EC) No 1347/2000 which is consequently repealed.\n(29) For the proper functioning of this Regulation, the Commission should review its application and propose such amendments as may appear necessary.\n(30) The United Kingdom and Ireland, in accordance with Article 3 of the Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland annexed to the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Community, have given notice of their wish to take part in the adoption and application of this Regulation.\n(31) Denmark, in accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on the position of Denmark annexed to the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Community, is not participating in the adoption of this Regulation and is therefore not bound by it nor subject to its application.\n(32) Since the objectives of this Regulation cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.\n(33) This Regulation recognises the fundamental rights and observes the principles of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. In particular, it seeks to ensure respect for the fundamental rights of the child as set out in Article 24 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union,\nHAS ADOPTED THE PRESENT REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I\nSCOPE AND DEFINITIONS\nArticle 1\nScope\n1. This Regulation shall apply, whatever the nature of the court or tribunal, in civil matters relating to:\n(a) divorce, legal separation or marriage annulment;\n(b) the attribution, exercise, delegation, restriction or termination of parental responsibility.\n2.

As against a respondent who is not habitually resident and is not either a national of a Member State or, in the case of the United Kingdom and Ireland, does not have his \"domicile\" within the territory of one of the latter Member States, any national of a Member State who is habitually resident within the territory of another Member State may, like the nationals of that State, avail himself of the rules of jurisdiction applicable in that State.\nSECTION 2\nParental responsibility\nArticle 8\nGeneral jurisdiction\n1. The courts of a Member State shall have jurisdiction in matters of parental responsibility over a child who is habitually resident in that Member State at the time the court is seised.\n2. Paragraph 1 shall be subject to the provisions of Articles 9, 10 and 12.\nArticle 9\nContinuing jurisdiction of the child's former habitual residence\n1. Where a child moves lawfully from one Member State to another and acquires a new habitual residence there, the courts of the Member State of the child's former habitual residence shall, by way of exception to Article 8, retain jurisdiction during a three-month period following the move for the purpose of modifying a judgment on access rights issued in that Member State before the child moved, where the holder of access rights pursuant to the judgment on access rights continues to have his or her habitual residence in the Member State of the child's former habitual residence.\n2. Paragraph 1 shall not apply if the holder of access rights referred to in paragraph 1 has accepted the jurisdiction of the courts of the Member State of the child's new habitual residence by participating in proceedings before those courts without contesting their jurisdiction.\nArticle 10\nJurisdiction in cases of child abduction\nIn case of wrongful removal or retention of the child, the courts of the Member State where the child was habitually resident immediately before the wrongful removal or retention shall retain their jurisdiction until the child has acquired a habitual residence in another Member State and:\n(a) each person, institution or other body having rights of custody has acquiesced in the removal or retention;\nor\n(b) the child has resided in that other Member State for a period of at least one year after the person, institution or other body having rights of custody has had or should have had knowledge of the whereabouts of the child and the child is settled in his or her new environment and at least one of the following conditions is met:\n(i) within one year after the holder of rights of custody has had or should have had knowledge of the whereabouts of the child, no request for return has been lodged before the competent authorities of the Member State where the child has been removed or is being retained;\n(ii) a request for return lodged by the holder of rights of custody has been withdrawn and no new request has been lodged within the time limit set in paragraph (i);\n(iii) a case before the court in the Member State where the child was habitually resident immediately before the wrongful removal or retention has been closed pursuant to Article 11(7);\n(iv) a judgment on custody that does not entail the return of the child has been issued by the courts of the Member State where the child was habitually resident immediately before the wrongful removal or retention.\nArticle 11\nReturn of the child\n1. Where a person, institution or other body having rights of custody applies to the competent authorities in a Member State to deliver a judgment on the basis of the Hague Convention of 25 October 1980 on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction (hereinafter \"the 1980 Hague Convention\"), in order to obtain the return of a child that has been wrongfully removed or retained in a Member State other than the Member State where the child was habitually resident immediately before the wrongful removal or retention, paragraphs 2 to 8 shall apply.\n2. When applying Articles 12 and 13 of the 1980 Hague Convention, it shall be ensured that the child is given the opportunity to be heard during the proceedings unless this appears inappropriate having regard to his or her age or degree of maturity.\n3. A court to which an application for return of a child is made as mentioned in paragraph 1 shall act expeditiously in proceedings on the application, using the most expeditious procedures available in national law.\nWithout prejudice to the first subparagraph, the court shall, except where exceptional circumstances make this impossible, issue its judgment no later than six weeks after the application is lodged.\n4. A court cannot refuse to return a child on the basis of Article 13b of the 1980 Hague Convention if it is established that adequate arrangements have been made to secure the protection of the child after his or her return.\n5. A court cannot refuse to return a child unless the person who requested the return of the child has been given an opportunity to be heard.\n6. If a court has issued an order on non-return pursuant to Article 13 of the 1980 Hague Convention, the court must immediately either directly or through its central authority, transmit a copy of the court order on non-return and of the relevant documents, in particular a transcript of the hearings before the court, to the court with jurisdiction or central authority in the Member State where the child was habitually resident immediately before the wrongful removal or retention, as determined by national law. The court shall receive all the mentioned documents within one month of the date of the non-return order.\n7. Unless the courts in the Member State where the child was habitually resident immediately before the wrongful removal or retention have already been seised by one of the parties, the court or central authority that receives the information mentioned in paragraph 6 must notify it to the parties and invite them to make submissions to the court, in accordance with national law, within three months of the date of notification so that the court can examine the question of custody of the child.\nWithout prejudice to the rules on jurisdiction contained in this Regulation, the court shall close the case if no submissions have been received by the court within the time limit.\n8. Notwithstanding a judgment of non-return pursuant to Article 13 of the 1980 Hague Convention, any subsequent judgment which requires the return of the child issued by a court having jurisdiction under this Regulation shall be enforceable in accordance with Section 4 of Chapter III below in order to secure the return of the child.\nArticle 12\nProrogation of jurisdiction\n1. The courts of a Member State exercising jurisdiction by virtue of Article 3 on an application for divorce, legal separation or marriage annulment shall have jurisdiction in any matter relating to parental responsibility connected with that application where:\n(a) at least one of the spouses has parental responsibility in relation to the child;\nand\n(b) the jurisdiction of the courts has been accepted expressly or otherwise in an unequivocal manner by the spouses and by the holders of parental responsibility, at the time the court is seised, and is in the superior interests of the child.\n2. The jurisdiction conferred in paragraph 1 shall cease as soon as:\n(a) the judgment allowing or refusing the application for divorce, legal separation or marriage annulment has become final;\n(b) in those cases where proceedings in relation to parental responsibility are still pending on the date referred to in (a), a judgment in these proceedings has become final;\n(c) the proceedings referred to in (a) and (b) have come to an end for another reason.\n3. The courts of a Member State shall also have jurisdiction in relation to parental responsibility in proceedings other than those referred to in paragraph 1 where:\n(a) the child has a substantial connection with that Member State, in particular by virtue of the fact that one of the holders of parental responsibility is habitually resident in that Member State or that the child is a national of that Member State;\nand\n(b) the jurisdiction of the courts has been accepted expressly or otherwise in an unequivocal manner by all the parties to the proceedings at the time the court is seised and is in the best interests of the child.\n4. Where the child has his or her habitual residence in the territory of a third State which is not a contracting party to the Hague Convention of 19 October 1996 on jurisdiction, applicable law, recognition, enforcement and cooperation in respect of parental responsibility and measures for the protection of children, jurisdiction under this Article shall be deemed to be in the child's interest, in particular if it is found impossible to hold proceedings in the third State in question.\nArticle 13\nJurisdiction based on the child's presence\n1. Where a child's habitual residence cannot be established and jurisdiction cannot be determined on the basis of Article 12, the courts of the Member State where the child is present shall have jurisdiction.\n2. Paragraph 1 shall also apply to refugee children or children internationally displaced because of disturbances occurring in their country.\nArticle 14\nResidual jurisdiction\nWhere no court of a Member State has jurisdiction pursuant to Articles 8 to 13, jurisdiction shall be determined, in each Member State, by the laws of that State.\nArticle 15\nTransfer to a court better placed to hear the case\n1. By way of exception, the courts of a Member State having jurisdiction as to the substance of the matter may, if they consider that a court of another Member State, with which the child has a particular connection, would be better placed to hear the case, or a specific part thereof, and where this is in the best interests of the child:\n(a) stay the case or the part thereof in question and invite the parties to introduce a request before the court of that other Member State in accordance with paragraph 4; or\n(b) request a court of another Member State to assume jurisdiction in accordance with paragraph 5.\n2. Paragraph 1 shall apply:\n(a) upon application from a party; or\n(b) of the court's own motion; or\n(c) upon application from a court of another Member State with which the child has a particular connection, in accordance with paragraph 3.\nA transfer made of the court's own motion or by application of a court of another Member State must be accepted by at least one of the parties.\n3. The child shall be considered to have a particular connection to a Member State as mentioned in paragraph 1, if that Member State:\n(a) has become the habitual residence of the child after the court referred to in paragraph 1 was seised; or\n(b) is the former habitual residence of the child; or\n(c) is the place of the child's nationality; or\n(d) is the habitual residence of a holder of parental responsibility; or\n(e) is the place where property of the child is located and the case concerns measures for the protection of the child relating to the administration, conservation or disposal of this property.\n4. The court of the Member State having jurisdiction as to the substance of the matter shall set a time limit by which the courts of that other Member State shall be seised in accordance with paragraph 1.\nIf the courts are not seised by that time, the court which has been seised shall continue to exercise jurisdiction in accordance with Articles 8 to 14.\n5. The courts of that other Member State may, where due to the specific circumstances of the case, this is in the best interests of the child, accept jurisdiction within six weeks of their seisure in accordance with paragraph 1(a) or 1(b). In this case, the court first seised shall decline jurisdiction. Otherwise, the court first seised shall continue to exercise jurisdiction in accordance with Articles 8 to 14.\n6. The courts shall cooperate for the purposes of this Article, either directly or through the central authorities designated pursuant to Article 53.\nSECTION 3\nCommon provisions\nArticle 16\nSeising of a Court\n1. A court shall be deemed to be seised:\n(a) at the time when the document instituting the proceedings or an equivalent document is lodged with the court, provided that the applicant has not subsequently failed to take the steps he was required to take to have service effected on the respondent;\nor\n(b) if the document has to be served before being lodged with the court, at the time when it is received by the authority responsible for service, provided that the applicant has not subsequently failed to take the steps he was required to take to have the document lodged with the court.\nArticle 17\nExamination as to jurisdiction\nWhere a court of a Member State is seised of a case over which it has no jurisdiction under this Regulation and over which a court of another Member State has jurisdiction by virtue of this Regulation, it shall declare of its own motion that it has no jurisdiction.\nArticle 18\nExamination as to admissibility\n1. Where a respondent habitually resident in a State other than the Member State where the action was brought does not enter an appearance, the court with jurisdiction shall stay the proceedings so long as it is not shown that the respondent has been able to receive the document instituting the proceedings or an equivalent document in sufficient time to enable him to arrange for his defence, or that all necessary steps have been taken to this end.\n2. Article 19 of Regulation (EC) No 1348/2000 shall apply instead of the provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article if the document instituting the proceedings or an equivalent document had to be transmitted from one Member State to another pursuant to that Regulation.\n3. Where the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1348/2000 are not applicable, Article 15 of the Hague Convention of 15 November 1965 on the service abroad of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters shall apply if the document instituting the proceedings or an equivalent document had to be transmitted abroad pursuant to that Convention.\nArticle 19\nLis pendens and dependent actions\n1. Where proceedings relating to divorce, legal separation or marriage annulment between the same parties are brought before courts of different Member States, the court second seised shall of its own motion stay its proceedings until such time as the jurisdiction of the court first seised is established.\n2. Where proceedings relating to parental responsibility relating to the same child and involving the same cause of action are brought before courts of different Member States, the court second seised shall of its own motion stay its proceedings until such time as the jurisdiction of the court first seised is established.\n3. Where the jurisdiction of the court first seised is established, the court second seised shall decline jurisdiction in favour of that court.\nIn that case, the party who brought the relevant action before the court second seised may bring that action before the court first seised.\nArticle 20\nProvisional, including protective, measures\n1. In urgent cases, the provisions of this Regulation shall not prevent the courts of a Member State from taking such provisional, including protective, measures in respect of persons or assets in that State as may be available under the law of that Member State, even if, under this Regulation, the court of another Member State has jurisdiction as to the substance of the matter.\n2. The measures referred to in paragraph 1 shall cease to apply when the court of the Member State having jurisdiction under this Regulation as to the substance of the matter has taken the measures it considers appropriate.\nCHAPTER III\nRECOGNITION AND ENFORCEMENT\nSECTION 1\nRecognition\nArticle 21\nRecognition of a judgment\n1. A judgment given in a Member State shall be recognised in the other Member States without any special procedure being required.\n2. In particular, and without prejudice to paragraph 3, no special procedure shall be required for updating the civil-status records of a Member State on the basis of a judgment relating to divorce, legal separation or marriage annulment given in another Member State, and against which no further appeal lies under the law of that Member State.\n3. Without prejudice to Section 4 of this Chapter, any interested party may, in accordance with the procedures provided for in Section 2 of this Chapter, apply for a decision that the judgment be or not be recognised.\nThe local jurisdiction of the court appearing in the list notified by each Member State to the Commission pursuant to Article 68 shall be determined by the internal law of the Member State in which proceedings for recognition or non-recognition are brought.\n4. Where the recognition of a judgment is raised as an incidental question in a court of a Member State, that court may determine that issue.\nArticle 22\nGrounds of non-recognition for judgments relating to divorce, legal separation or marriage annulment\nA judgment relating to a divorce, legal separation or marriage annulment shall not be recognised:\n(a) if such recognition is manifestly contrary to the public policy of the Member State in which recognition is sought;\n(b) where it was given in default of appearance, if the respondent was not served with the document which instituted the proceedings or with an equivalent document in sufficient time and in such a way as to enable the respondent to arrange for his or her defence unless it is determined that the respondent has accepted the judgment unequivocally;\n(c) if it is irreconcilable with a judgment given in proceedings between the same parties in the Member State in which recognition is sought; or\n(d) if it is irreconcilable with an earlier judgment given in another Member State or in a non-Member State between the same parties, provided that the earlier judgment fulfils the conditions necessary for its recognition in the Member State in which recognition is sought.\nArticle 23\nGrounds of non-recognition for judgments relating to parental responsibility\nA judgment relating to parental responsibility shall not be recognised:\n(a) if such recognition is manifestly contrary to the public policy of the Member State in which recognition is sought taking into account the best interests of the child;\n(b) if it was given, except in case of urgency, without the child having been given an opportunity to be heard, in violation of fundamental principles of procedure of the Member State in which recognition is sought;\n(c) where it was given in default of appearance if the person in default was not served with the document which instituted the proceedings or with an equivalent document in sufficient time and in such a way as to enable that person to arrange for his or her defence unless it is determined that such person has accepted the judgment unequivocally;\n(d) on the request of any person claiming that the judgment infringes his or her parental responsibility, if it was given without such person having been given an opportunity to be heard;\n(e) if it is irreconcilable with a later judgment relating to parental responsibility given in the Member State in which recognition is sought;\n(f) if it is irreconcilable with a later judgment relating to parental responsibility given in another Member State or in the non-Member State of the habitual residence of the child provided that the later judgment fulfils the conditions necessary for its recognition in the Member State in which recognition is sought.\nor\n(g) if the procedure laid down in Article 56 has not been complied with.\nArticle 24\nProhibition of review of jurisdiction of the court of origin\nThe jurisdiction of the court of the Member State of origin may not be reviewed. The test of public policy referred to in Articles 22(a) and 23(a) may not be applied to the rules relating to jurisdiction set out in Articles 3 to 14.\nArticle 25\nDifferences in applicable law\nThe recognition of a judgment may not be refused because the law of the Member State in which such recognition is sought would not allow divorce, legal separation or marriage annulment on the same facts.\nArticle 26\nNon-review as to substance\nUnder no circumstances may a judgment be reviewed as to its substance.\nArticle 27\nStay of proceedings\n1. A court of a Member State in which recognition is sought of a judgment given in another Member State may stay the proceedings if an ordinary appeal against the judgment has been lodged.\n2. A court of a Member State in which recognition is sought of a judgment given in Ireland or the United Kingdom may stay the proceedings if enforcement is suspended in the Member State of origin by reason of an appeal.\nSECTION 2\nApplication for a declaration of enforceability\nArticle 28\nEnforceable judgments\n1. A judgment on the exercise of parental responsibility in respect of a child given in a Member State which is enforceable in that Member State and has been served shall be enforced in another Member State when, on the application of any interested party, it has been declared enforceable there.\n2. However, in the United Kingdom, such a judgment shall be enforced in England and Wales, in Scotland or in Northern Ireland only when, on the application of any interested party, it has been registered for enforcement in that part of the United Kingdom.\nArticle 29\nJurisdiction of local courts\n1. An application for a declaration of enforceability shall be submitted to the court appearing in the list notified by each Member State to the Commission pursuant to Article 68.\n2. The local jurisdiction shall be determined by reference to the place of habitual residence of the person against whom enforcement is sought or by reference to the habitual residence of any child to whom the application relates.\nWhere neither of the places referred to in the first subparagraph can be found in the Member State of enforcement, the local jurisdiction shall be determined by reference to the place of enforcement.\nArticle 30\nProcedure\n1. The procedure for making the application shall be governed by the law of the Member State of enforcement.\n2. The applicant must give an address for service within the area of jurisdiction of the court applied to. However, if the law of the Member State of enforcement does not provide for the furnishing of such an address, the applicant shall appoint a representative ad litem.\n3. The documents referred to in Articles 37 and 39 shall be attached to the application.\nArticle 31\nDecision of the court\n1. The court applied to shall give its decision without delay. Neither the person against whom enforcement is sought, nor the child shall, at this stage of the proceedings, be entitled to make any submissions on the application.\n2. The application may be refused only for one of the reasons specified in Articles 22, 23 and 24.\n3. Under no circumstances may a judgment be reviewed as to its substance.\nArticle 32\nNotice of the decision\nThe appropriate officer of the court shall without delay bring to the notice of the applicant the decision given on the application in accordance with the procedure laid down by the law of the Member State of enforcement.\nArticle 33\nAppeal against the decision\n1. The decision on the application for a declaration of enforceability may be appealed against by either party.\n2. The appeal shall be lodged with the court appearing in the list notified by each Member State to the Commission pursuant to Article 68.\n3. The appeal shall be dealt with in accordance with the rules governing procedure in contradictory matters.\n4. If the appeal is brought by the applicant for a declaration of enforceability, the party against whom enforcement is sought shall be summoned to appear before the appellate court. If such person fails to appear, the provisions of Article 18 shall apply.\n5. An appeal against a declaration of enforceability must be lodged within one month of service thereof. If the party against whom enforcement is sought is habitually resident in a Member State other than that in which the declaration of enforceability was given, the time for appealing shall be two months and shall run from the date of service, either on him or at his residence. No extension of time may be granted on account of distance.\nArticle 34\nCourts of appeal and means of contest\nThe judgment given on appeal may be contested only by the proceedings referred to in the list notified by each Member State to the Commission pursuant to Article 68.\nArticle 35\nStay of proceedings\n1. The court with which the appeal is lodged under Articles 33 or 34 may, on the application of the party against whom enforcement is sought, stay the proceedings if an ordinary appeal has been lodged in the Member State of origin, or if the time for such appeal has not yet expired. In the latter case, the court may specify the time within which an appeal is to be lodged.\n2. Where the judgment was given in Ireland or the United Kingdom, any form of appeal available in the Member State of origin shall be treated as an ordinary appeal for the purposes of paragraph 1.\nArticle 36\nPartial enforcement\n1. Where a judgment has been given in respect of several matters and enforcement cannot be authorised for all of them, the court shall authorise enforcement for one or more of them.\n2. An applicant may request partial enforcement of a judgment.\nSECTION 3\nProvisions common to Sections 1 and 2\nArticle 37\nDocuments\n1. A party seeking or contesting recognition or applying for a declaration of enforceability shall produce:\n(a) a copy of the judgment which satisfies the conditions necessary to establish its authenticity;\nand\n(b) the certificate referred to in Article 39.\n2. In addition, in the case of a judgment given in default, the party seeking recognition or applying for a declaration of enforceability shall produce:\n(a) the original or certified true copy of the document which establishes that the defaulting party was served with the document instituting the proceedings or with an equivalent document;\nor\n(b) any document indicating that the defendant has accepted the judgment unequivocally.\nArticle 38\nAbsence of documents\n1. If the documents specified in Article 37(1)(b) or (2) are not produced, the court may specify a time for their production, accept equivalent documents or, if it considers that it has sufficient information before it, dispense with their production.\n2. If the court so requires, a translation of such documents shall be furnished. The translation shall be certified by a person qualified to do so in one of the Member States.\nArticle 39\nCertificate concerning judgments in matrimonial matters and certificate concerning judgments on parental responsibility\nThe competent court or authority of a Member State of origin shall, at the request of any interested party, issue a certificate using the standard form set out in Annex I (judgments in matrimonial matters) or in Annex II (judgments on parental responsibility).\nSECTION 4\nEnforceability of certain judgments concerning rights of access and of certain judgments which require the return of the child\nArticle 40\nScope\n1.

The rights of access referred to in Article 40(1)(a) granted in an enforceable judgment given in a Member State shall be recognised and enforceable in another Member State without the need for a declaration of enforceability and without any possibility of opposing its recognition if the judgment has been certified in the Member State of origin in accordance with paragraph 2.\nEven if national law does not provide for enforceability by operation of law of a judgment granting access rights, the court of origin may declare that the judgment shall be enforceable, notwithstanding any appeal.\n2. The judge of origin shall issue the certificate referred to in paragraph 1 using the standard form in Annex III (certificate concerning rights of access) only if:\n(a) where the judgment was given in default, the person defaulting was served with the document which instituted the proceedings or with an equivalent document in sufficient time and in such a way as to enable that person to arrange for his or her defense, or, the person has been served with the document but not in compliance with these conditions, it is nevertheless established that he or she accepted the decision unequivocally;\n(b) all parties concerned were given an opportunity to be heard;\nand\n(c) the child was given an opportunity to be heard, unless a hearing was considered inappropriate having regard to his or her age or degree of maturity.\nThe certificate shall be completed in the language of the judgment.\n3. Where the rights of access involve a cross-border situation at the time of the delivery of the judgment, the certificate shall be issued ex officio when the judgment becomes enforceable, even if only provisionally. If the situation subsequently acquires a cross-border character, the certificate shall be issued at the request of one of the parties.\nArticle 42\nReturn of the child\n1. The return of a child referred to in Article 40(1)(b) entailed by an enforceable judgment given in a Member State shall be recognised and enforceable in another Member State without the need for a declaration of enforceability and without any possibility of opposing its recognition if the judgment has been certified in the Member State of origin in accordance with paragraph 2.\nEven if national law does not provide for enforceability by operation of law, notwithstanding any appeal, of a judgment requiring the return of the child mentioned in Article 11(b)(8), the court of origin may declare the judgment enforceable.\n2. The judge of origin who delivered the judgment referred to in Article 40(1)(b) shall issue the certificate referred to in paragraph 1 only if:\n(a) the child was given an opportunity to be heard, unless a hearing was considered inappropriate having regard to his or her age or degree of maturity;\n(b) the parties were given an opportunity to be heard; and\n(c) the court has taken into account in issuing its judgment the reasons for and evidence underlying the order issued pursuant to Article 13 of the 1980 Hague Convention.\nIn the event that the court or any other authority takes measures to ensure the protection of the child after its return to the State of habitual residence, the certificate shall contain details of such measures.\nThe judge of origin shall of his or her own motion issue that certificate using the standard form in Annex IV (certificate concerning return of the child(ren)).\nThe certificate shall be completed in the language of the judgment.\nArticle 43\nRectification of the certificate\n1. The law of the Member State of origin shall be applicable to any rectification of the certificate.\n2.

The translation shall be certified by a person qualified to do so in one of the Member States.\nSECTION 5\nAuthentic instruments and agreements\nArticle 46\nDocuments which have been formally drawn up or registered as authentic instruments and are enforceable in one Member State and also agreements between the parties that are enforceable in the Member State in which they were concluded shall be recognised and declared enforceable under the same conditions as judgments.\nSECTION 6\nOther provisions\nArticle 47\nEnforcement procedure\n1. The enforcement procedure is governed by the law of the Member State of enforcement.\n2. Any judgment delivered by a court of another Member State and declared to be enforceable in accordance with Section 2 or certified in accordance with Article 41(1) or Article 42(1) shall be enforced in the Member State of enforcement in the same conditions as if it had been delivered in that Member State.\nIn particular, a judgment which has been certified according to Article 41(1) or Article 42(1) cannot be enforced if it is irreconcilable with a subsequent enforceable judgment.\nArticle 48\nPractical arrangements for the exercise of rights of access\n1. The courts of the Member State of enforcement may make practical arrangements for organising the exercise of rights of access, if the necessary arrangements have not or have not sufficiently been made in the judgment delivered by the courts of the Member State having jurisdiction as to the substance of the matter and provided the essential elements of this judgment are respected.\n2. The practical arrangements made pursuant to paragraph 1 shall cease to apply pursuant to a later judgment by the courts of the Member State having jurisdiction as to the substance of the matter.\nArticle 49\nCosts\nThe provisions of this Chapter, with the exception of Section 4, shall also apply to the determination of the amount of costs and expenses of proceedings under this Regulation and to the enforcement of any order concerning such costs and expenses.\nArticle 50\nLegal aid\nAn applicant who, in the Member State of origin, has benefited from complete or partial legal aid or exemption from costs or expenses shall be entitled, in the procedures provided for in Articles 21, 28, 41, 42 and 48 to benefit from the most favourable legal aid or the most extensive exemption from costs and expenses provided for by the law of the Member State of enforcement.\nArticle 51\nSecurity, bond or deposit\nNo security, bond or deposit, however described, shall be required of a party who in one Member State applies for enforcement of a judgment given in another Member State on the following grounds:\n(a) that he or she is not habitually resident in the Member State in which enforcement is sought; or\n(b) that he or she is either a foreign national or, where enforcement is sought in either the United Kingdom or Ireland, does not have his or her \"domicile\" in either of those Member States.\nArticle 52\nLegalisation or other similar formality\nNo legalisation or other similar formality shall be required in respect of the documents referred to in Articles 37, 38 and 45 or in respect of a document appointing a representative ad litem.\nCHAPTER IV\nCOOPERATION BETWEEN CENTRAL AUTHORITIES IN MATTERS OF PARENTAL RESPONSIBILITY\nArticle 53\nDesignation\nEach Member State shall designate one or more central authorities to assist with the application of this Regulation and shall specify the geographical or functional jurisdiction of each. Where a Member State has designated more than one central authority, communications shall normally be sent direct to the relevant central authority with jurisdiction.

The judgment on placement referred to in paragraph 1 may be made in the requesting State only if the competent authority of the requested State has consented to the placement.\n3. The procedures for consultation or consent referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be governed by the national law of the requested State.\n4. Where the authority having jurisdiction under Articles 8 to 15 decides to place the child in a foster family, and where such placement is to take place in another Member State and where no public authority intervention is required in the latter Member State for domestic cases of child placement, it shall so inform the central authority or other authority having jurisdiction in the latter State.\nArticle 57\nWorking method\n1.

Member States shall communicate to the Commission the official language or languages of the Community institutions other than their own in which communications to the central authorities can be accepted.\n3. The assistance provided by the central authorities pursuant to Article 55 shall be free of charge.\n4. Each central authority shall bear its own costs.\nArticle 58\nMeetings\n1.

whereas the resulting principle of non-discriminatory treatment as regards nationality applies inter alia to the grant of any authorization required to take up activities in the field of architecture and also to the registration with or membership of professional organizations or bodies;\nWhereas it nevertheless seems desirable that certain provisions be introduced to facilitate the effective exercise of the right of establishment and freedom to provide services in respect of activities in the field of architecture;\nWhereas, pursuant to the Treaty, Member States are required not to grant any form of aid likely to distort the conditions of establishment;\nWhereas Article 57 (1) of the Treaty provides that directives be issued for the mutual recognition of diplomas, certificates and other evidence of formal qualifications;\nWhereas architecture, the quality of buildings, the way they blend in with their surroundings, respect for the natural and urban environment and the collective and individual cultural heritage are matters of public concern; whereas, therefore, the mutual recognition of diplomas, certificates and other evidence of formal qualifications must be founded on qualitative and quantitative criteria ensuring that the holders of recognized diplomas, certificates and other evidence of formal qualifications are able to understand and give practical expression to the needs of individuals, social groups and communities as regards spatial planning, the design, organization and construction of buildings, the conservation and enhancement of the architectural heritage and preservation of the natural balance;\nWhereas methods of education and training for those practising professionally in the field of architecture are at present very varied; whereas, however, provision should be made for progressive alignment of education and training leading to the pursuit of activities under the professional title of architect;\nWhereas, in some Member States, the taking up and pursuit of the activities of architect are by law conditional upon the possession of a diploma in architecture; where, in certain other Member States where this condition does not exist, the right to hold the professional title of architect is none the less governed by law; whereas, finally, in some Member States where neither the former nor the latter is the case, laws and regulations are being prepared on the taking up and pursuit of these activities under the professional title of architect; whereas, therefore, the conditions under which such activities may be taken up and pursued in those Member States have not yet been laid down; whereas the mutual recognition of diplomas, certificates and other evidence of formal qualifications presupposes that such diplomas, certificates and other evidence of formal qualifications authorize the taking up and pursuit of certain activities in the Member State of issue; whereas, therefore, the recognition of certain certificates under this Directive should continue to apply only in so far as the holders of such certificates will be authorized, in accordance with legal provisions still to be adopted in the Member State of issue, to take up activities under the professional title of architect;\nWhereas acquisition of the lawful professional title of architect is subject in some Member States to completion of a period of practical experience in addition to the possession of a diploma, certificate or other evidence of formal qualifications; whereas, since practice in this respect of present varies from one Member State to another, to obviate possible difficulties completion of an equal period of appropriate practical experience in another Member State should be recognized as meeting this condition;\nWhereas the reference in Article 1 (2) to 'activities in the field of architecture' as being 'those activities usually pursued under the professional title of architect', the justification for which lies in the conditions prevailing in certain Member States, is intended solely to indicate the scope of this Directive, without claiming to give a legal definition of activities in the field of architecture;\nWhereas, in most Member States, activities in the field of architecture are pursued, in law or in fact, by persons who hold the title of architect, whether alone or together with another title, without those persons having a monopoly in pursuing those activities save where there are laws to the contrary; whereas the aforementioned activities, or some of them, may also be pursued by members of other professions, in particular by engineers who have received special training in construction engineering or building;\nWhereas the mutual recognition of qualifications will facilitate the taking up and pursuit of the activities in question;\nWhereas in some Member States there is legislation allowing the lawful professional title of architect, by way of exception and notwithstanding the usual educational and training requirements for access to the title, to be granted to certain distinguished persons in the field, who are very few in number and whose work shows exceptional architectural talent; whereas the case of these architects should be covered in this Directive, particularly since they frequently enjoy an international reputation;\nWhereas the recognition of a number of the existing diplomas, certificates and other evidence of formal qualifications in architecture listed in Articles 10 to 12 is intended to enable the holders thereof to establish themselves or provide services in other Member States with immediate effect; whereas the sudden introduction of this provision in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg could, in view of the country's small size, lead to distortion of competition and disturb the organization of the profession; whereas, as a result, there appears to be justification for allowing this Member State an additiional period of adjustment;\nWhereas, since a Directive on the mutual recognition of diplomas, certificates and other evidence of formal qualifications in architecture does not necessarily imply practical equivalence in the education and training covered by such diplomas, certificates and evidence, the use of titles should be authorized only in the language of the Member State of origin or of the Member State from which a foreign national comes;\nWhereas, to facilitate the application of this Directive by the national authorities, Member States may prescribe that, in addition to evidence of qualifications, persons who satisfy the educational and training requirements of this Directive must provide a certificate from the competent authorities of their Member State of origin or of the country from which they come stating that these qualifications are those referred to by the Directive;\nWhereas the national provisions with regard to good repute and good character may be applied as standards for the taking up of activities if establishment takes place; whereas, moreover, in the circumstances a distinction should be drawn between cases in which the persons concerned have never yet exercised any activities in the field of architecture and those in which they have already exercised such activities in another Member State;\nWhereas, in the case of the provision of services, the requirement of registration with, or membership of, professional organizations or bodies would, since it is related to the fixed and permanent nature of the activity pursued in the host Member State, undoubtedly constitute an obstacle to the provider of services by reason of the temporary nature of his activity; whereas this requirement should therefore be abolished; whereas, however, in this event control over professional discipline, which is the responsibility of these professional organizations or bodies, should be guaranteed; whereas, to this end, it should be provided, subject to the application of Article 62 of the Treaty, that the person concerned may be required to notify the provision of services to the competent authority of the host Member State;\nWhereas, as far as the activities of employed persons in the field of architecture are concerned, Council Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68 of 15 October 1968 on freedom of movement for workers within the Community (1) lays down no specific provisions relating to good character or good repute, professional discipline or use of title for the professions covered; whereas, depending on the individual Member State, such rules are or may be applicable both to employed and to self-employed persons; whereas activities in the field of architecture are subject in several Member States to possession of a diploma, certificate or other evidence of formal qualifications; whereas such activities are pursued by both employed and self-employed persons, or by the same persons in both capacities in the course of their professional career; whereas, in order to encourage fully the free movement of members of the profession within the Community, it therefore appears necessary to extend this Directive to employed persons in the field of architecture;\nWhereas this Directive introduces mutual recognition of diplomas, certificates and other evidence of formal qualifications giving access to professional activities, without concomitant coordination of national provisions relating to education and training; whereas, moreover, the number of members of the profession who are concerned varies considerably from one Member State to another; whereas the first few years of application of this Directive must therefore be followed particularly attentively by the Commission,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nCHAPTER I\nSCOPE\nArticle 1\n1. This Directive shall apply to activities in the field of architecture.\n2. For the purposes of this Directive, activities in the field of architecture shall be those activities usually pursued under the professional title of architect.\nCHAPTER II\nDIPLOMAS, CERTIFICATES AND OTHER EVIDENCE OF FORMAL QUALIFICATIONS ENABLING THE HOLDER TO TAKE UP ACTIVITIES IN THE FIELD OF ARCHITECTURE UNDER THE PROFESSIONAL TITLE OF ARCHITECT\nArticle 2\nEach Member State shall recognize the diplomas, certificates and other evidence of formal qualifications acquired as a result of education and training fulfilling the requirements of Articles 3 and 4 and awarded to nationals of Member States by other Member States, by giving such diplomas, certificates and other evidence of formal qualifications, as regards the right to take up activities referred to in Article 1 and pursue them under the professional title of architect pursuant to Article 23 (1), the same effect in its territory as those awarded by the Member State itself.\nArticle 3\nEducation and training leading to diplomas, certificates and other evidence of formal qualifications referred to in Article 2 shall be provided through courses of studies at university level concerned principally with architecture. Such studies shall be balanced between the theoretical and practical aspects of architectural training and shall ensure the acquisition of:\n1. an ability to create architectural designs that satisfy both aesthetic and technical requirements,\n2. an adequate knowledge of the history and theories of architecture and the related arts, technologies and human sciences,\n3. a knowledge of the fine arts as an influence on the quality of architectural design,\n4. an adequate knowledge of urban design, planning and the skills involved in the planning process,\n5. an understanding of the relationship between people and buildings, and between buildings and their environment, and of the need to relate buildings and the spaces between them to human needs and scale,\n6. an understanding of the profession of architecture and the role of the architect in society, in particular in preparing briefs that take account of social factors,\n7. an understanding of the methods of investigation and preparation of the brief for a design project,\n8. an understanding of the structural design, constructional and engineering problems associated with building design,\n9. an adequate knowledge of physical problems and technologies and of the function of buildings so as to provide them with internal conditions of comfort and protection against the climate,\n10. the necessary design skills to meet building users' requirements within the constraints imposed by cost factors and building regulations,\n11. an adequate knowledge of the industries, organizations, regulations and procedures involved in translating design concepts into buildings and integrating plans into overall planning.\nArticle 4\n1. The education and training referred to in Article 2 must satisfy the requirements defined in Article 3 and also the following conditions:\n(a) the total length of education and training shall consist of a minimum of either four years of full-time studies at a university or comparable educational establishment, or at least six years of study at a university or comparable educational establishment of which at least three must be full time;\n(b) such education and training shall be concluded by successful completion of an examination of degree standard.\nNotwithstanding the first subparagraph, recognition under Article 2 shall also be accorded to the training given over three years in the 'Fachhochschulen' in the Federal Republic of Germany in the form in which it exists at the time of notification of this Directive and in so far as it satisfies the requirements laid down in Article 3, giving access to the activities referred to in Article 1 in that Member State with the professional title of architect, provided that such training is supplemented by a four-year period of professional experience in the Federal Republic of Germany sanctioned by a certificate issued by the professional body on whose list the architect wishing to benefit from the provisions of this Directive is registered. The body shall previously have established that the work carried out by the architect concerned in the field of architecture constitutes conclusive proof of the practical application of all the knowledge referred to in Article 3.

Procedure\n(1) On 28 June 1977 Ireland imposed an anti-dumping duty of 38 % on imports of louvre doors originating in Taiwan by Statutory Instrument No 200 'Imposition of Duties (No 14) (Anti-dumping duty on wooden louvre doors) Order 1977'. The application of this duty has been continued under the transitional provisions of the 1972 Act of Accession.\n(2) On 16 June 1981 the Commission in Regulation (EEC) No 1590/81 (3) published the results of a review it had carried out of a national anti-dumping duty imposed by the United Kingdom on imports of louvre doors originating in Taiwan and cancelled the United Kingdom national duty.\n(3) The Commission received a request from a timber agent, operating in Ireland, Timber Marketing Services Ltd, requesting a review of a national anti-dumping duty imposed by Ireland on imports of louvre doors originating in Taiwan.\n(4) Timber Marketing Services Ltd maintained that Ireland and the United Kingdom purchased their requirements of Taiwanese louvre doors from the same sources. In these circumstances and taking account of the fact that the United Kingdom national duty had been cancelled. Timber Marketing Services suggested that the Irish national duty should also be cancelled.\n(5) The Commission decided that there was sufficient evidence to justify a review of the anti-dumping duty imposed on imports into Ireland of wooden louvre doors, falling within subheading ex 44.23 B II of the Common Customs Tariff and corresponding to NIMEXE code ex 44.23-51, originating in Taiwan and gave notice of the review in the Official Journal of the European Communities (4).\n(6) The Commission officially so advised the exporters, importers and producers thought to be concerned and gave the parties directly concerned the opportunity to make known their views in writing and to request a hearing. Some of these parties made known their views in writing. No interested party requested a hearing.\nB. Dumping\n(7) The investigation showed that exports of louvre doors from Taiwan to Ireland had completely ceased since the imposition of the Irish anti-dumping duty. It was therefore impossible to make a comparison of export prices with the normal value for a recent representative period.\nC. Injury\n(8) The sole producer of louvre doors in Ireland stated that as there had been no recent competition from Taiwan it was impossible to demonstrate that he had been injured by such exports. He also said that most production of wooden louvre doors had transferred from Taiwan to other third countries which had taken the place of Taiwan in exporting to Ireland.\nD. Conclusion\n(9) In these circumstances the Commission considers that the national anti-dumping duty on imports into Ireland of wooden louvre doors originating in Taiwan is no longer serving any purpose and should consequently be cancelled. No objection to this course of action was made by the Advisory Committee.\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nThe anti-dumping duty of 38 % imposed under the transitional provisions of the 1972 Act of Accession on imports into Ireland of wooden louvre doors, falling within subheading ex 44.23 B II of the Common Customs Tariff and corresponding to NIMEXE code ex 44.23-51, originating in Taiwan is hereby cancelled.\nArticle 2\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\nDone at Brussels, 12 January 1984.",

REQUEST\nB. PRODUCT\nC. EXISTING MEASURES\nD. GROUNDS\nThe evidence submitted is as follows:\nThe request shows a significant change in the pattern of trade, as imports of the products under investigation have increased substantially, whereas imports of the product concerned originating in the People’s Republic of China have decreased following the imposition of measures, and that there is insufficient due cause or justification other than the imposition of the duty for such a change.\nThis change in the pattern of trade appears to stem from the transhipment of CFL-i originating in the People’s Republic of China via Vietnam, Pakistan or the Philippines and/or assembly in Vietnam, Pakistan or the Philippines of CFL-i.\nFurthermore, the request contains sufficient prima facie evidence that the remedial effects of the existing anti-dumping measures on imports of the product concerned originating in the People’s Republic of China are being undermined in terms of quantity and prices. Significant volumes of imports of CFL-i from Vietnam, Pakistan and the Philippines appear to have replaced imports of the product concerned originating in the People’s Republic of China.\nFinally, the request contains sufficient prima facie evidence that the prices of the product under investigation are dumped in relation to the normal value previously established for CFL-i originating in the People’s Republic of China.\nE. PROCEDURE\n(a) Questionnaires\n(b) Collection of information and holding of hearings\n(c) Exemption of registration of imports or measures\nF. REGISTRATION\nG TIME LIMITS\nIn the interest of sound administration, time limits should be stated within which:\n-\ninterested parties may make themselves known to the Commission, present their views in writing and submit questionnaire replies or any other information to be taken into account during the investigation,\n-\nproducers in Vietnam, Pakistan and the Philippines may request exemption from registration of imports or measures,\n-\ninterested parties may make a written request to be heard by the Commission.\nH. NON-COOPERATION\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nAn investigation is hereby initiated pursuant to Article 13(3) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96, in order to determine if imports into the Community of electronic compact fluorescent discharge lamps with one or more glass tubes, with all lighting elements and electronic components fixed to the lamp foot or integrated in the lamp foot, falling within CN code ex 8539 31 90 (TARIC code 85393190*91), consigned from Vietnam, Pakistan or the Philippines, whether declared as originating in Vietnam, Pakistan or the Philippines or not, are circumventing the measures imposed by Regulation (EC) No 1470/2001 on imports of integrated electronic compact fluorescent lamps (CFL-i) originating in the People’s Republic of China.\nFor the purpose of this Regulation, electronic compact fluorescent discharge lamps shall consist of one or more glass tubes, with all lighting elements and electronic components fixed to the lamp foot or integrated in the lamp foot. They are designed to replace normal incandescent lamps and fit into the same sockets as the incandescent lamps and are produced in different types, depending on, inter alia, the lifetime, the wattage and the cover of the lamp.\nArticle 2\nThe Customs authorities are hereby directed, pursuant to Articles 13(3) and 14(5) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96, to take the appropriate steps to register the imports into the Community identified in Article 1 of this Regulation.\nRegistration shall expire nine months following the date of entry into force of this Regulation.\nThe Commission, by regulation, may direct Customs authorities to cease registration in respect of imports into the Community of products exported by exporters having applied for an exemption of registration and having been found not to be circumventing the anti-dumping duties.\nArticle 3\n1. Questionnaires should be requested from the Commission within 15 days from publication of this Regulation in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n2. If their representations are to be taken into account during the investigation, interested parties must make themselves known by contacting the Commission, present their views in writing and submit questionnaire replies or any other information within 40 days from the date of the publication of this Regulation in the Official Journal of the European Union, unless otherwise specified.\n3.

To this end, the Commission shall be empowered to borrow, on behalf of the Community, the necessary resources that will be placed at the disposal of Albania in the form of a loan.\n3. The loan referred to in paragraph 2 will be managed by the Commission in close consultation with the Economic and Financial Committee and in a manner consistent with any agreement reached between the IMF and Albania.\nArticle 2\n1.

The Commission asked supplementary information with letters dated 4 May 2005, 19 July 2005, and 14 November 2005. Italy provided the Commission with further information by letters dated 27 June 2005, 5 July 2005, 3 October 2005, 1st February 2006.\n(2)\nBy letter dated 4 April 2006, the Commission informed Italy that it had decided to initiate the procedure laid down in Article 88(2) of the EC Treaty in respect of the aid. Italy did not reply to the letter of the Commission and provided no observations in the procedure.\n(3)\nThe Commission decision to initiate the procedure was published in the Official Journal of the European Union (2). The Commission called on interested parties to submit their comments.\n(4)\nThe Commission received no comments from AEM Torino. No other interested parties submitted observation either.\n(5)\nThe measure under assessment concerns the reimbursement that Italy intends to grant to AEM Torino for the stranded costs in the energy sector. AEM Torino is one of the so-called ‘aziende municipalizzate’ and is active, in particular, in the energy sector. The measure is based on a similar measure approved by the Commission on 1 December 2004 (3).\n(6)\nThe amount of the aid is EUR 16,338 million, to be given in the form of grants.\n(7)\nItaly indicated its intention to submit an annual report on the implementation of the measure.\n(8)\nItaly indicated that the measure under assessment cannot be cumulated with any other aid.\n(9)\nOn 5 June 2002, the Commission has taken a negative decision on State aid granted by Italy to public utilities owned by local public administrative bodies (hereinafter, ‘municipalizzate’) in the form of tax exemptions and subsidised loans to public utilities with a majority public capital holding (4) (State aid C 27/99, ex NN 69/98).\n(10)\nThe Commission decision declared such non-notified schemes unlawful and incompatible and imposed to the Italian State to recover any possible amount disbursed under those schemes (5).\n(11)\nThe recovery process has been very slow. Italy has adopted Law 18 April 2005, n. 62 whose article 27 provides for the recovery of the aid granted to the municipalizzate in application of the Commission decision. However, beneficiaries can be allowed to repay the aid in instalments, over a period of 24 months. Such provision has been enforced by a decision taken by the Agenzia delle Entrate on 1 June 2005.\n(12)\nAccording to its own submissions in the pending Case T-297/02 ACEA v Commission, AEM Torino has benefited from the aid schemes assessed in the Commission Decision 2003/193/EC, both by benefiting from the tax exemptions in 1997, 1998 and 1999 and by receiving subsidised loans from the Cassa Depositi e Prestiti.\n(13)\nFurther, according to information provided by Italy, AEM Torino has submitted information, in the ordinary procedures of tax assessment and collection, pursuant to the decision of the Agenzia delle Entrate. AEM Torino should pay the ascertained amount of illegal aid within 60 days as from the communication of the result of the assessment that, according to the information sent by Italian authorities, should have been notified by the Agenzia delle Entrate not later than 11 January 2006. No information has been provided by Italy on the effective payment by AEM Torino in the deadlines indicated.\n(14)\nAccording to the information sent by the Italian authorities in the present case, AEM Torino would not have benefited from loans granted by the Cassa Depositi e Prestiti.\n(15)\nSince the Commission cannot control cumulation between the old illegal aid received in application of the Italian scheme for the municipalizzate and the new aid under examination, it has asked Italy to ensure that such effect was avoided by taking the commitment to pay the aid for the stranded costs only after the previous illegal aid had been paid back. Italy declined to do so.\n(16)\nThe Commission has found that the measure under assessment should be considered State aid.\n(17)\nThe Commission has then analysed the compatibility of the measure with State aid rules, in particular in light of the Commission Communication relating to the methodology for analysing State aid linked to stranded costs (6). It found that the methodology used for the calculation of the amount and the calculation itself did satisfy all the elements indicated in the Communication.\n(18)\nHowever, in its judgement of 15 May 1997 (7), the Court of Justice has stated that ‘when the Commission examines the compatibility of a State aid with the common market it must take all the relevant factors into account, including, where appropriate, the circumstances already considered in a prior decision and the obligations which that decision may have imposed on a Member State’. According to the Court of Justice, a new aid may not be assessed as compatible with the common market as long as the old unlawful aid has not been repaid, since the cumulative effect of the aids may distort competition in the common market to a significant extent.\n(19)\nTherefore, pursuant to the above case-law, the Commission assesses a new aid measure taking into account if the beneficiary of the new aid has fully repaid any previous aid that has to be recovered pursuant to a negative decision taken by the Commission.\n(20)\nBy applying the principle stated in the above judgement to the present case, the Commission realizes that: a) AEM Torino has benefited from a previous aid, notably the aid granted to the municipalizzate (see paragraphs 9 to 15 above), that has to be recovered pursuant to the Decision 2003/193/EC; and b) the Italian authorities have not complied yet with the recovery obligation contained in the Decision 2003/193/EC. It is true that this decision concerns a scheme, but it also orders recovery of illegal and incompatible aid paid out under that scheme. Moreover, AEM Torino has expressly admitted that it had benefited from that scheme and there are no reasons to believe that, in its particular case, the measures at stake do not constitute aid, or constitute existing aid, or have been declared compatible with the common market.\n(21)\nAfter four years from the adoption of the Decision 2003/193/EC the Italian authorities still have to recover the illegal aids. They have informed the Commission that they are still in the process of fulfilling their recovery obligation by adopting and implementing the appropriate administrative measures.\n(22)\nIn particular Italy has indicated that AEM Torino has submitted a declaration to the Agenzia delle Entrate committing to pay the sums that the Agenzia will indicate. However, they have not been able to indicate:\n-\nThe amount that AEM Torino has to pay back in the recovery process;\n-\nThe conditions for the payment: Italy indicates that the company should pay back as of 11 March 2006, but failed to provide any assurance that the payment would be complete (including interests) and immediate (not using the 24 months delay foreseen in the Law 18 April 2005, n. 62).\n(23)\nFurther, it is unclear if AEM Torino has benefited from the subsidised loans granted by the Cassa Depositi e Prestiti which were declared illegal by the previous decision, and, in case it did, if it has reimbursed them.\n(24)\nIn conclusion, Italy has not clarified whether the previous aid that in all likelihood has been received by AEM Torino has been recovered yet. Based on the above mentioned information, it should be inferred that AEM Torino may have received and not yet reimbursed certain aid amounts granted under the scheme declared incompatible by the Decision 2003/193/EC.\n(25)\nThe Commission is unable to determine the amount of aid which AEM Torino had already received prior to the new aid under examination and which still has to be reimbursed and cannot assess the cumulative effect of both the ‘old’ and ‘new’ aid accruing to AEM Torino and its likely distortionary impact on the common market.\n(26)\nThe Commission, pursuant to the Deggendorf judgement, must take into account the circumstances already considered in a prior decision and the obligations which that decision may have imposed on a Member State and cannot decide upon the compatibility with the common market of a new aid as long as the old unlawful aid has not been repaid.\n(27)\nFurther, aid to reimbourse stranded costs cannot be cumulated with any other aid.\n(28)\nOnly a commitment to ensure that the payment of the new aid would follow after the full reimbursement of the previous aid would have avoided any risk of cumulative effect of the two aid measures and any distortion of competition, under the principle established by the Court in the Deggendorf judgement.\n(29)\nItaly has been asked repeatedly to take such commitment but has refused to do so.\n(30)\nThus, the cumulative effect of the two aids was present but could not be fully assessed by the Commission. Therefore, at that stage, the notified aid could not be declared compatible with the common market.\n(31)\nNeither Italy nor the beneficiary dispelled the doubts in the decision to open the procedure. Italy did not reply to the letter opening this procedure. AEM Torino neither submitted any information.\n(32)\nThe grounds on which the Commission opened the procedure have not been disputed. The measure constitutes an aid that can be declared compatible on the basis of the methodology for the stranded costs. However, because of the potential cumulation with a previous aid that the beneficiary has not reimbursed, the Commission cannot control the combined effect of the two aids.\n(33)\nItaly has not provided any information that would allow the Commission to assess the potential cumulation. Furthermore, the recovery process has been particularly slow and difficult. Therefore, the Commission decided on 19 January 2005 to refer the matter to the Court of Justice under art. 88(2) of the EC Treaty, in order to ensure an immediate and effective execution of the Decision 2003/193/EC.\n(34)\nOn 1st June 2006, the Court ruled (8) that, by failing to take within the prescribed period all the measures necessary for repayment of the aid found to be unlawful and incompatible with the common market, Italy has failed to fulfil its obligations under that article.\n(35)\nThe Commission has to ensure that the granting of the new aid takes place only at a time when this risk of cumulation can be excluded, that is only after AEM Torino has fully reimbursed the illegal and incompatible aid received.\n(36)\nAs a consequence, the Commission has to follow closely that the condition mentioned above is fully respected.\n(37)\nConsequently, Italy should be allowed to grant the new aid only after having submitted evidence to the Commission about the full recovery from AEM Torino.\n(38)\nIn light of the foregoing, the Commission confirms its assessment that the notified measure concerning aid for stranded costs that Italy intends to grant to AEM Torino is to be considered an aid which is compatible with the EC Treaty.\n(39)\nHowever, the investigation has confirmed that the Commission is unable to control that the combined effect of the new aid and the previous illegal and incompatible aid brings about undue distortion of competition which could be contrary to the EC Treaty.\n(40)\nHenceforth, acting on the basis of article 7 (4) of Regulation (EC) n. 659/1999 (9), the Commission concludes that the notified aid shall not be granted to the beneficiary before it will have reimbursed the previous illegal and incompatible aid.\n(41)\nFinally, before granting the aid under assessment, Italy has to submit to the Commission evidence that the previous aid has been fully reimbursed by AEM Torino,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\nArticle 1\nThe aid which Italy is planning to implement for AEM Torino amounting to EUR 16,338 million for the stranded costs is compatible with the common market, subject to the conditions set out in Article 2.\nArticle 2\nThe aid referred to in article 1 may not be granted before Italy has submitted evidence to the Commission that AEM Torino either has not benefited from previous aid granted under the ‘municipalizzate’ scheme declared illegal and incompatible by the Decision 2003/193/EC or that it has reimbursed with interests the previous aid received under the above-mentioned scheme.\nArticle 3\nItaly shall inform the Commission, within two months of notification of this Decision, of the measures taken to comply with it.\nArticle 4\nThis Decision is addressed to Italy.\nDone at Brussels, 8 November 2006.",

Technical measures should therefore be adopted to allow the coexistence of GSM and other systems in the 900 MHz band.\n(3)\nThe 1 710-1 785 MHz and 1 805-1 880 MHz frequency bands (the 1 800 MHz band) have become available for GSM operation and are currently used by GSM systems across Europe. The 1 800 MHz band should also be opened under the same conditions as the 900 MHz band to other terrestrial systems capable of providing electronic communications services that can coexist with GSM systems.\n(4)\nThe current use of GSM in the 1 800 MHz band should be protected throughout the Community as long as there is reasonable demand for the service, in line with the approach taken to protect the use of GSM in the 900 MHz band by Directive 87/372/EEC.\n(5)\nPursuant to Article 4(2) of the Radio Spectrum Decision, the Commission issued a mandate on 5 July 2006 to the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (hereinafter the CEPT) to develop least restrictive technical conditions for frequency bands addressed in the context of WAPECS (wireless access policy for electronic communications services), which include the 900 MHz and 1 800 MHz bands.\n(6)\nTechnological neutrality and service neutrality are policy goals that have been supported by the Member States in the Radio Spectrum Policy Group (hereinafter the RSPG) Opinion on WAPECS of 23 November 2005 to achieve more flexible use of spectrum. The RSPG Opinion on WAPECS considers that these policy goals should be introduced gradually rather than suddenly so as to avoid any disruption of the market. The Commission set out its views on the more flexible use of spectrum in its Communication on ‘Rapid access to spectrum for wireless electronic communications services through more flexibility’ (6), which, inter alia, stresses the need for a consistent and proportionate solution regarding the second and third generation mobile bands in the context of introducing flexible spectrum use for electronic communications services.\n(7)\nIn line with the approach taken to the opening of the 900 MHz band by Directive 87/372/EEC, the 1 800 MHz band currently used for GSM should therefore also be designated for GSM and for other terrestrial systems capable of providing electronic communications services which can coexist with GSM systems, and Member States should take whatever measures are necessary to protect the continued operation of GSM systems from harmful interference.\n(8)\nAny other system deployed in the 900 MHz and 1 800 MHz bands needs to ensure technical compatibility both with adjacent networks operated by other right holders in these bands and with the use of frequency bands adjacent to the 900 and 1 800 MHz bands.\n(9)\nFor harmonisation measures pursuant to the Radio Spectrum Decision, technical compatibility is demonstrated by compatibility studies performed by the CEPT via a mandate from the Commission. These studies should help to define the technical conditions needed to ensure the coexistence of a growing number of terrestrial systems capable of providing electronic communications services. A list should be established of systems demonstrating such technical compatibility, which the Commission should amend, as appropriate, with the assistance of the Radio Spectrum Committee in line with the WAPECS principles, and thus increase the number of systems with harmonised access to the 900 and 1 800 MHz bands over time.\n(10)\nWorking on the basis of technical investigations, in particular Reports 82 and 96 of the Electronic Communications Committee (ECC) of the CEPT, and on the response to the mandate of 5 July 2006 in CEPT Report 19, the CEPT has concluded that UMTS/900/1 800 networks can be deployed in urban, sub-urban and rural areas in coexistence with GSM/900/1 800 networks, using appropriate values for carrier separation.\n(11)\nThe results of the mandate to the CEPT should be made applicable in the Community and implemented by the Member States without delay, given the market demand for the introduction of UMTS in these bands. In addition, Member States should ensure that UMTS gives appropriate protection to existing systems in adjacent bands.\n(12)\nTo increase flexibility while at the same time preserving the necessary pan-European coverage by electronic communications services in harmonised bands, Member States should furthermore have the power to allow the introduction in the 900 and 1 800 MHz bands of other systems alongside GSM and other identified terrestrial systems capable of providing electronic communications services, provided that they ensure the coexistence of such terrestrial systems.\n(13)\nRadio spectrum technical management includes the harmonisation and allocation of radio spectrum. This harmonisation should reflect the requirements of general policy principles identified at Community level. However, radio spectrum technical management does not cover assignment and licensing procedures (including their timing), or any decision whether to use competitive selection procedures for the assignment of radio frequencies.\n(14)\nDifferences in the existing national situations could result in distortion of competition. The existing regulatory framework gives Member States the tools they need to deal with these problems in a proportionate, non-discriminatory and objective manner, subject to Community law, including Directive 87/372/EEC, Directive 2002/20/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on the authorisation of electronic communications networks and services (Authorisation Directive) (7) and Directive 2002/21/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on a common regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services (Framework Directive) (8).\n(15)\nThe use of spectrum is subject to the requirements of Community law on public health protection, in particular Directive 2004/40/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the minimum health and safety requirements regarding the exposure of workers to the risks arising from physical agents (electromagnetic fields) (18th individual Directive within the meaning of Article 16(1) of Directive 89/391/EEC) (9) and Council Recommendation 1999/519/EC of 12 July 1999 on the limitation of exposure of the general public to electromagnetic fields (0 Hz to 300 GHz) (10). Health protection for radio equipment is ensured by compliance of such equipment with the essential requirements of Directive 1999/5/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 March 1999 on radio equipment and telecommunications terminal equipment and the mutual recognition of their conformity (11).\n(16)\nIn order to ensure effective use of the 900 MHz and 1 800 MHz bands also in the longer term, administrations should continue with studies to increase efficiency and innovative use. With a view to reviewing this Decision to cover additional technologies, these and other studies undertaken by the CEPT on the basis of further mandates could demonstrate that systems other than GSM and UMTS are capable of providing terrestrial electronic communications services with pan-European coverage and can ensure technical compatibility with GSM and UMTS by appropriate means.\n(17)\nThe measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Radio Spectrum Committee,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\nArticle 1\nThis Decision aims to harmonise the technical conditions for the availability and efficient use of the 900 MHz band, in accordance with Directive 87/372/EEC, and of the 1 800 MHz band for terrestrial systems capable of providing electronic communications services.\nArticle 2\nFor the purposes of this Decision, the following definitions shall apply:\n(a)\n‘GSM system’ means an electronic communications network that complies with the GSM Standards, as published by ETSI, in particular EN 301 502 and EN 301 511;\n(b)\nthe ‘900 MHz band’ means the 880-915 MHz and 925-960 MHz bands;\n(c)\nthe ‘1 800 MHz band’ means the 1 710-1 785 MHz and 1 805-1 880 MHz bands.\nArticle 3\nThe terrestrial systems capable of providing electronic communications services that can coexist with GSM systems in the 900 MHz band within the meaning of Article 1(1) of Directive 87/372/EEC are listed in the Annex. They shall be subject to the conditions and the implementation deadlines laid down therein.\nArticle 4\n1. The 1 800 MHz band shall be designated and made available for GSM systems by 9 November 2009.\n2. The 1 800 MHz band shall be designated and made available for those other terrestrial systems capable of providing electronic communications services that are listed in the Annex, subject to the conditions and implementation deadlines laid down therein.\nArticle 5\n1. Member States may designate and make available the 900 MHz and 1 800 MHz bands for other terrestrial systems not listed in the Annex, provided that they ensure that:\n(a)\nsuch systems can coexist with GSM systems;\n(b)\nsuch systems can coexist with other systems listed in the Annex, both on their own territory and in neighbouring Member States.\n2. Member States shall ensure that other systems referred to in Article 3 and Article 4(2) and paragraph 1 of this Article give appropriate protection to systems in adjacent bands.\nArticle 6\nMember States shall keep the use of the 900 MHz and 1 800 MHz bands under review to ensure the efficient use thereof and in particular report to the Commission any need for a revision of the Annex.\nArticle 7\nThis Decision is addressed to the Member States.\nDone at Brussels, 16 October 2009.",

The Ministry of Finance, National Fund, has been appointed for the financial functions it is due to perform in the framework of the implementation of the Sapard.\n(4) On the basis of a case-by-case analysis of the national and sectorial programme/project management capacity, financial control procedures and structures regarding public finance, as provided for in Article 12(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1266/1999, the Commission adopted Decision 2002/539/EC of 2 July 2002 conferring management of aid on implementing agencies for preaccession measures in agriculture and rural development in the Republic of Poland in the preaccession period(5) with regard to certain measures provided for in the Sapard.\n(5) The Commission has since undertaken a further analysis under Article 12(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1266/1999 in respect of Measure 4 \"Diversification of economic activities in rural areas\" (hereinafter \"Measure 4\") as provided for in the Sapard. The Commission considers that, also with regard to that measure, the Republic of Poland complies with the provisions of Articles 4 to 6 and of the Annex to Commission Regulation (EC) No 2222/2000 of 7 June 2000 laying down financial rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1268/1999 on Community support for preaccession measures for agriculture and rural development in the applicant countries of central and eastern Europe in the preaccession period(6), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 188/2003(7), and with the minimum conditions set out in the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 1266/1999.\n(6) It is therefore appropriate to waive the ex ante approval requirement provided for in Article 12(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1266/1999 and to confer, with regard to Measure 4, on the Agency for Restructuring and Modernisation of Agriculture, and on the National Fund in the Republic of Poland, the management of aid on a decentralised basis.\n(7) Since the verifications carried out by the Commission for Measure 4 are based on a system that is not yet fully operating with regard to all relevant elements, however, it is appropriate to confer the management of the Sapard on the Agency for Restructuring and Modernisation of Agriculture, and on the National Fund, according to Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2222/2000, on a provisional basis.\n(8) Full conferral of management of the Sapard is only envisaged after further verifications to ensure that the system operates satisfactorily have been carried out and after any recommendations which the Commission may issue with regard to the conferral of management of aid on the Agency for Restructuring and Modernisation of Agriculture, and on the National Fund, have been implemented.\n(9) On 27 October 2003 the Polish Authorities proposed the rules for eligibility of expenditure in accordance with Article 4(1) of Section B of the Multiannual Financing Agreement. The Commission is called upon to take a decision in this respect,\nHAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:\nArticle 1\nThe requirement of ex ante approval by the Commission of project selection and contracting for Measure 4 by the Republic of Poland provided for in Article 12(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1266/1999 is hereby waived.\nArticle 2\nManagement of the Sapard is conferred on a provisional basis on:\n1. the Agency for Restructuring and Modernisation of Agriculture in its role as Sapard agency of the Republic of Poland, located at Al.

PROCEDURE\n(1)\nBy letter dated 29 August 2005, registered as received on 1 September 2005, Germany notified the Commission of aid to be granted in the form of a SME bonus to EverQ GmbH (hereinafter: Sovello (2)). By letters dated 28 October 2005, 24 January 2006 and 4 April 2006, registered as received on the same day, Germany provided the Commission with further information.\n(2)\nOn 7 June 2006, the Commission approved, under reference C(2006) 2092 final, the SME bonus for Sovello (State aid case N 426/05 (3)).\n(3)\nDuring its examination of another notified aid measure for Sovello (State aid case C 21/08 (4) - ex N 864/06), the Commission uncovered evidence that the decision on State aid case N 426/2005 may have been based on incomplete/incorrect information submitted during the notification procedure.\n(4)\nBy letter dated 17 March 2008, the Commission gave Germany the opportunity to comment on the intention of the Commission to open the formal investigation procedure before possibly revoking its decision of 7 June 2006, in line with Article 9 of Council Regulation (EC) No 659/1999 of 22 March 1999 laying down detailed rules for the application of Article 93 of the EC Treaty (5). Germany submitted its comments by letters dated 15 April 2008, registered as received on 15 and 16 April 2008 respectively.\n(5)\nBy letter dated 17 June 2008, with reference C(2008) 2669 final, the Commission informed Germany that it had decided to initiate the procedure laid down in Article 108(2) TFEU in respect of the SME bonus granted to Sovello.\n(6)\nThe Commission decision to initiate the procedure was published in the Official Journal of the European Union (6). The Commission called on interested parties to submit their comments.\n(7)\nGermany submitted its comments by letter dated 10 September 2008, registered as received on the same day. Germany submitted further comments by letters dated 20 March, 13 May, and 16 November 2009, registered as received on the same day respectively. Meetings between the Commission services and the German authorities took place on 2 April and 13 October 2009.\n(8)\nThe Commission did not receive any comments from third parties.\n2. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE AID\n2.1. The project\n(9)\nThe purpose of the overall aid project (regional aid granted under approved aid schemes plus the notified SME bonus) was to build a new 30 MWp plant (Sovello1) to manufacture solar modules (ProdCom code 32.10.52.37) based on the String-Ribbon technology (7). The new plant was Sovello’s first production site. The construction started in December 2004. The factory was intended to have a nominal production capacity of 30 Megawatt peak (8) and to be functional by 31 December 2007. Sovello1 already started production in April 2006.\n2.2. The beneficiary\n(10)\nThe beneficiary of the notified aid is Sovello. Sovello was established as a joint venture in December 2004 by Q-Cells SE (9) (hereinafter Q-Cells) - owning 24,9 % of the shares - and the US firm Evergreen Solar Inc. (hereinafter: Evergreen) - owning 75,1 %. This situation is reflected in the initial master joint venture agreement (10) dated 14 January 2005 (hereinafter: MJVA1) between Evergreen and Q-Cells. As indicated in the MJVA1, prior to the date of this agreement, Q-Cells acquired Topas 107 V.V. GmbH, a shelf-company, which Q-Cells was to cause to become Sovello (at that time EverQ). The name of the shelf-company was changed to EverQ on 11 February 2005.\n(11)\nEvergreen is a producer of solar modules and owns a patent on the String-Ribbon technology. Q-Cells is one of the largest producers of solar cells in the world. The aim of the joint venture Sovello was to first test the economic viability of the production of solar modules - based on the String-Ribbon technology brought in by Evergreen, and the cell manufacturing know-how and experience on the German market of Q-Cells - and at a later stage to enable industrial manufacturing of String-Ribbon modules.\n(12)\nIn November 2005, Renewable Energy Corporation ASA (Norway) (hereinafter: REC) joined and took a participation of 15 % (based on a contract for silicon delivery to Sovello), whereas Evergreen and Q-Cells lowered their participation to respectively 64 % and 21 %. This situation is reflected in the second master joint venture agreement dated 25 November 2005 (hereinafter: MJVA2) between Evergreen, Q-Cells and REC. REC is among the world’s largest producers of silicon materials for the photovoltaic industry.\n(13)\nAt the time of notification, Q-Cells and REC had a joint shareholder, the venture capital company Good Energies Investment BV (hereinafter: Good Energies). This company held 16 % of the shares of Q-Cells and 39 % of the shares of REC (situation on 7 March 2006). The German authorities informed that no further relationship between Q-Cells, REC and Evergreen existed besides having a share in Sovello.\n(14)\nSince 19 December 2006, the partners Evergreen, Q-Cells and REC each hold a share of 33,3 % in Sovello (amendment to the MJVA2, dated 29 September 2006).\n(15)\nOn 5 February 2007, Q-Cells announced its plans to take a share of 17,9 % in REC. On the same date, Good Energies announced in a press release that it would sell its share in REC to Q-Cells and Orkla ASA (26 February 2007).\n(16)\nThe current shareholder structure of Sovello is represented in the figure below (situation Q3 2009):\n(17)\nDifferent company documents and shareholder decisions illustrate the development of Sovello. The document titled ‘Project “Sovello”: Heads of Agreement’ (hereinafter: Heads of Agreement), signed by the CEO’s of Evergreen and Q-Cells, is anterior to the MJVA1. This agreement outlines a possible transaction between the two companies regarding the establishment and conduct of a joint venture for the development, manufacture and sale of solar products based upon String-Ribbon technology. The text mentions the understanding of the parties that in order to qualify for certain German government subsidies, Q-Cells’ ownership of Sovello must be less than 25 %. It also announces the will of the parties to ensure that they both have a shared voice in major company actions, and contains provisions which point to the essential role of Q-Cells for the operability of the joint venture.\n(18)\nThe Articles of Association of Sovello also confer to Q-Cells substantial decisional rights (the Supervisory Board is composed of two persons nominated by Evergreen and one by Q-Cells, but for several strategic decisions the agreement of at least one of each partners’ nominees is required).\n(19)\nThe MJVA1 sets the participation of Evergreen in Sovello at 75,1 %, and that of Q-Cells at 24,9 %. It however includes the possibility for Q-Cells to - if this would not result in a decrease of investment grants - increase its ownership interest to 50 %. The MJVA1 foresees additional possible agreements between the parties (on services, technology, and marketing). In reality, the modules produced by Sovello were distributed by Evergreen under the Evergreen brand (until early 2009).\n(20)\nThe MJVA2 sets the following shareholder structure: Evergreen 64 %, Q-Cells 21 % and REC 15 %. It confirms the possibility for Q-Cells to increase its share up to the same level as Evergreen, whereas for REC, the possibility to increase its share to 21 % and to 33,3 % is subject to further silicon supply contracts.\n(21)\nThe timeline representing the development of Sovello along important company documents and decisions is summarized in table I below.\nTable I\nDevelopment of Sovello\nDate\nDocument or fact\nShareholder structure\nSummer 2004\nHeads of Agreement\nEvergreen 75,1 %, Q-Cells 24,9 %\n27.12.2004\nApplication for aid\n13.1.2005\nArticles of Association of Sovello\n14.1.2005\nInitial master joint venture agreement (MJVA1)\n21.4.2005\nGranting of aid\n1.9.2005\nNotification of SME bonus (N 426/05)\n25.11.2005\nSecond master joint venture agreement (MJVA2)\nREC 15 %, Evergreen 64 %, Q-Cells 21 %\n7.6.2006\nCommission approval of SME bonus (N 426/05)\n29.9.2006\n(effective as from 19.12.2006)\nModification of the MJVA2\nEvergreen, Q-Cells and REC each 33,3 %\n2.3.

Applicable regional aid intensity ceiling\n(24)\nThe investment is located in Thalheim, Landkreis Bitterfeld, Sachsen-Anhalt, Germany, an assisted area pursuant to Article 107(3)(a) TFEU, with an aid intensity ceiling of 35 % gross grant equivalent (GGE), according to the Guidelines on national regional aid (12) (hereinafter: RAG 1998) and the regional aid map established for Germany and in force till the end of 2006 (13).\n2.5. Aid amount and aid intensity\n(25)\nThe aid under scrutiny concerns a SME bonus of 15 %, notified under N 426/05 required by the approval decision pursuant to Article 4(3)(b) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 70/2001 of 12 January 2001 on the application of Articles 87 and 88 of the EC Treaty to State aid to small and medium-sized enterprises (14) (hereinafter: SME block-exemption Regulation), to be granted as a top-up to regional aid granted to Sovello on the basis of the existing regional aid schemes ‘Improvement of the regional economic structure’ (State aid N 642/02 (15) - hereinafter: the GA scheme), and the ‘Investment Premium Law 2005’ (State aid N 142a/04 (16) - hereinafter: the IZ scheme). The SME bonus corresponds to an aid amount of EUR 9 130 995.\n2.6. Assessment of SME status of Sovello in Commission decision N 426/05\n(26)\nFor SMEs, the RAG 1998 allow to complement regional investment aid by a SME bonus (17). The SME bonus to Sovello was granted as a top-up to regional aid granted lawfully under the German GA scheme.\n(27)\nTo establish whether a firm constitutes a SME, the Commission applies the Commission recommendation 2003/361/EC of 6 May 2003 concerning the definition of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (18) (hereinafter: the SME Recommendation). In particular, it tests whether the firm concerned meets certain ceilings (staff headcount, turnover, size of balance sheet). In these tests, the corresponding data for linked enterprises (having dominant influence by, mainly, holding the majority of voting rights) are fully taken into account, whereas the data for partner enterprises (holding a minimum of 25 % of shares or voting rights) are taken into account proportionally to their share in the target enterprise.\n(28)\nIn its decision N 426/05 (see above recital 2), the Commission included in its calculation the relevant data for Sovello itself and for Evergreen, but not the data for Q-Cells and REC, since at the time of notification and until the Commission took its approval decision they held less than 25 % in shares or voting rights. On this basis, the Commission concluded that Sovello was an SME and approved the notified aid.\n3. GROUNDS FOR INITIATING THE FORMAL INVESTIGATION PROCEDURE\n3.1. The new information\n(29)\nThe new information discovered by the Commission during its assessment of another notified aid for Sovello concerns the MJVA1 between Evergreen and Q-Cells on the creation of Sovello, which was not submitted to the Commission during the preliminary investigation phase for the case N 426/05. This information led to concerns that the joint venture partners had kept the participation of Q-Cells artificially below 25 % (first at 24,9 %) in order to maximize the allowable amount of State aid (including an SME bonus), whereas Q-Cells was represented in the board of the joint venture by one out of three directors, with a veto right on important decisions. On this basis, the Commission invited Germany to comment on its intention to open the formal investigation procedure before possibly revoking its original decision of 7 June 2006, in line with Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 659/1999.\n(30)\nWith its letter dated 15 April 2008, Germany submitted a copy of the Articles of Association of Sovello, of the Heads of Agreement, as well as notarised copies of the MJVA1, the MJVA2 and the amended MJVA2. In this letter, Germany took the view that in the case of Sovello, at the time of the notification, the formal criteria concerning the thresholds as defined in the Commission recommendation were met and that no other clearly defined and practically usable criteria are spelled out in the SME Recommendation. Therefore, Germany was of the opinion that these formal criteria for the determination of the SME status of an enterprise should be decisive, in order to ensure legal certainty and calculability of the Commission State aid control policy, and that, if the Commission is of the view that these formal criteria are not adequate anymore, it should not change its practice in the context of individual cases, but consider changing the applicable rules itself.\n(31)\nGermany further observed that it did not deliberately conceal nor withhold information at the time of the notification, and that the initial participations of the shareholders (75,1 % for Evergreen and 24,9 % for Q-Cells) were based on economic grounds. Germany further reported that the participation of Q-Cells in the initial joint venture did not relieve Sovello from the typical handicaps of starting SMEs.\n3.2. Possible consequences of the new information for the assessment\n(32)\nThe Commission however took the view that even if Sovello may have met the formal criteria of the SME definition, the Commission had strong indications that these formal criteria were only met by artificially keeping the participation of Q-Cells in Sovello below 25 %, with the essential purpose to obtain a SME bonus, while the effective influence of Q-Cells in Sovello was stronger. Consequently, the Commission considered that it must be alert to the possibility that the shareholder structure of the beneficiary had been artificially designed in order to circumvent the SME definition.\n(33)\nThe new information thus led to the fact that the Commission had doubts whether Sovello constituted a SME in the sense of the SME Recommendation. If this was not the case, the notified and approved SME bonus would be incompatible with the TFEU.\n(34)\nBefore revoking its original decision of 7 June 2006, which might have been based on incomplete/incorrect information, and taking a new decision, the Commission opened the formal investigation procedure, in accordance with Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 659/1999. This Article 9 stipulates that ‘the Commission may revoke a decision (…) after having given the Member State concerned the opportunity to submit its comments, where the decision was based on incorrect information provided during the procedure which was a determining factor for the decision. Before revoking a decision and taking a new decision, the Commission shall open the formal investigation procedure pursuant to Article 4(4). (…)’.\n4. COMMENTS FROM INTERESTED PARTIES\n(35)\nThe Commission received no observations from interested parties.\n5. COMMENTS FROM THE GERMAN AUTHORITIES\n5.1. Legal basis\n5.1.1. Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 659/1999 not applicable\n(36)\nGermany is of the opinion that the pre-conditions for the revocation of the decision N 426/05 - on the basis of alleged new information - do not exist. Germany claims that the information it provided to the Commission in the context of the notification of case N 426/05 was neither incomplete nor incorrect, and that consequently Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 659/1999 is not applicable. Germany argues that the Commission was informed of the fact that Sovello was a newly founded technology enterprise in the solar industry, created as a joint venture between Evergreen and Q-Cells, which did not exceed the thresholds of the SME definition and which was exposed to the typical handicaps of an SME. Germany adds that neither the MJVA1 nor the Heads of Agreement contain new information which could justify a revocation of the decision N 426/05.\n(37)\nGermany claims that at the request of the Commission (letter dated 30 December 2005, D/57570), it provided the model declaration as annexed to the Commission Communication ‘Model declaration on the information relating to the qualification of an enterprise as an SME’ (19) (hereinafter: the Commission Communication on the Model declaration) for Sovello in the context of the notification, stating that Evergreen is a linked enterprise with Sovello and that Sovello is independent from Q-Cells. Germany also submitted a declaration under oath from Q-Cells stating that it is nor a partner to nor a linked company with Sovello.\n(38)\nGermany argues that it, nor Sovello, have seen any indication in the SME block-exemption Regulation, in the Commission Communication on the Model declaration, or in the information requests of the Commission, which invited them to provide the joint venture agreement in the course of the notification. Therefore, Germany is of the opinion that it has submitted complete information at that time.\n5.1.2. No additional criteria to be considered\n(39)\nGermany observes that whereas to define SMEs the former SME recommendation of 1996 (20) refers to thresholds as well as a so-called independency criterion, the actual SME definition solely differentiates between autonomous, partner and linked enterprises. Germany argues that the actual SME block-exemption Regulation, in conjunction with the SME definition, is binding for the Commission, and can certainly not be narrowed by adding unwritten criteria. Neither the Court of Justice nor the Court of First Instance has in its judgements considered such unwritten criteria in cases based on the new SME definition.\n(40)\nGermany contests that the independence criteria set out by the Court of Justice in its judgment on case C 91/01 Italy v Commission (21) (hereinafter: the Solar Tech case), based on the former SME recommendation of 1996, remain also valid for cases to be assessed on the basis of the new SME definition. According to Germany, to base an assessment on such unwritten criteria would be incompatible with the objective of revising the SME definition stated in recital 8 of the SME block-exemption Regulation: ‘In order to eliminate differences that might give rise to distortions of competitions, in order to facilitate coordination between different Community and national initiatives concerning small and medium-sized enterprises, and for reasons of administrative clarity and legal certainty, …’.\n(41)\nGermany argues that for the sake of legal certainty and equal treatment, the Commission should first publish possible changes (incorporation of new additional criteria) to the SME definition, before applying such changes to individual cases. Moreover, if the European legislator had wished to consider the criterion of ‘suffering the typical handicaps of an SME’, it would have taken up this criterion in its new SME definition. Whether a company suffers the typical handicaps of an SME should therefore only be verified using the formal SME criteria. Germany adds that the determination of a 25 % threshold for partner enterprises would be obsolete when in practice this threshold would not be applied.\n(42)\nGermany states that the aim of the new SME definition was to allow for a consistent promotion of SMEs and their control by national administrations and courts on the basis of clear and unequivocal definitions. It deduces that the new SME definition therefore leaves no scope for judgment evaluation or for unwritten conditional elements.\n5.1.3. Solar Tech and Pollmeier cases are not comparable to Sovello\n(43)\nGermany furthermore brings forward that neither the holding structure nor the economic conditions of the companies referred to in the Solar Tech and the Pollmeier Malchow GmbH & Co. KG v Commission (22) cases, which are judgments based on the former SME recommendation of 1996, are comparable to the situation of Sovello.\n(44)\nIn the Solar Tech case, the beneficiary Solar Tech was owned for only 24 % by the Permasteelisa concern (a large company), but the founder and majority shareholder of this concern, being also the manager of Solar Tech, owned 46 % of the capital, and the president of the concern as well as a member of the board of Permasteelisa both owned 15 % of the capital. On the basis of this financial interdependence, the possible influence of Permasteelisa shareholders, and the economic and organisational ties with Permasteelisa, the Commission concluded that Solar Tech did not suffer the typical handicaps of an SME and hence did not fulfil the independence criterion. Germany notes that in the Sovello joint venture however, both shareholders Evergreen and Q-Cells were independent from each other, and the minority shareholder Q-Cells did not have more influence in Sovello than that of a shareholder owning 24,9 % (see also point 5.3 below).\n(45)\nIn the Pollmeier case, the beneficiary Pollmeier was fully owned by a natural person through an intermediary company. All the other companies controlled by this natural person were active in the same or parallel economic sectors. The Commission considered the enterprises owned by this natural person as one economic entity and cumulated the financial data and staff headcounts, which exceeded the SME thresholds. Germany notes that at the time of the creation of Sovello however, both shareholders were independent from each other and had different purposes (research and development in the field of solar technology, for Evergreen, and the production of solar cells, for Q-Cells). The typical SME handicaps of Sovello could hence not be compensated by the integration in a group of large companies.\n5.1.4. No exception for joint ventures\n(46)\nGermany claims that the Commission in its opening decision of 17 June 2008 (see recital 5) goes beyond its authority in that it seems to assume that a beneficiary is automatically to be treated as one economic entity together with its joint venture partners, and that therefore the financial data and staff headcounts of all the joint venture partners should always be cumulated for the calculation of the SME thresholds.\n(47)\nGermany states that thus the Commission claims the authority to take out a whole group of undertakings (namely joint ventures) from the application of the legally binding SME definition and to develop and apply particular SME criteria for this group of undertakings. Germany contests that such right could be derived from the case law of the European Courts on the former SME recommendation of 1996 or from any past Commission practice.\n5.2. Typical SME handicaps of Sovello\n(48)\nGermany asserts that at the time of notification, with its limited number of employees and limited financial resources, Sovello did suffer from typical SME handicaps related to financing of the investment project, commercialization of the output, as well as business and operational organisation. Germany recognizes the synergy effects of the cooperation with Evergreen and Q-Cells, but contests that these could compensate the typical SME handicaps of Sovello.\n5.2.1. SME handicaps related to financing\n(49)\nGermany claims that without public support Sovello would not have obtained external financing for its investment project in Thalheim. Germany states that the ratio of external investment financing for the Sovello project (EUR 8 million, i.e. 13 % of the total investment) is typical for SMEs. Germany adds that only […] of the […] solicited banks were interested in financing the project, one of which was only willing to provide EUR […] working capital and bridging finance up to 50 % of the public support. This situation would be typical for SMEs, not for large companies.\n(50)\nGermany informs that the loan contract for the external financing was only concluded on […] November 2005. It was not possible to negotiate favourable lending conditions because of the […] credit rating of Sovello and the […] financial participation of the shareholders (as well as the […] financial situation of Sovello). Sovello had difficulties in providing sufficient securities for the loan (as it was not yet owner of the land, machinery and installations had not yet been delivered, buildings were still being constructed and there was no stock). The shareholders could […] provide […] securities either.\n(51)\nGermany argues that the shareholders could only bring in very limited own resources. Until 2006, only Evergreen provided financing exceeding its share capital and capital reserves. Q-Cells was not […] to bring in such extra capital, as its […] resources were […] tied in its own investment projects.\n(52)\nGermany states that the investment project could not have been carried out if no State aid including SME bonus would have been granted.\n5.2.2. SME handicaps related to commercialization\n(53)\nGermany further argues that Sovello was confronted to a substantial commercial risk, as it was still to demonstrate that the String-Ribbon technology could lead to industrially marketable products. The fact that Sovello had a sales agreement with Evergreen could not really reduce this risk because Evergreen was an SME itself and had no knowledge on the German market. The other shareholder, Q-Cells, had no experience in selling solar modules, as it only produced solar cells. Moreover, Q-Cells was also an SME (23) and had to concentrate its efforts on the commercialisation of its own output.\n5.2.3. SME handicaps related to business and operational organisation\n(54)\nThe German authorities claim that the costs linked to business and operational organisation of Sovello were comparably higher than those of large enterprises. E.g. Sovello had to […].\n5.3. Influence of Q-Cells on Sovello\n(55)\nGermany contests that the influence of Q-Cells on Sovello at the time of notification was higher than the normal influence of a shareholder owning 24,9 % in Sovello. It rather says that such participation percentage is not unusual for similar projects of start-ups in high technology sectors.\n(56)\nGermany explains that Evergreen took the initiative to start the project. In 10 years Evergreen had spent more than USD […] million developing the String-Ribbon technology without succeeding in making it profitable. The share price of Evergreen went down from ca. USD 20 in 2000 to about USD 2 in 2003-2004. Evergreen had to keep maximal control on the investment project, in order to ensure a maximum return for its shareholders in case of success, but it could not raise sufficient capital without the financial participation of a business partner. Q-Cells was a good candidate because in addition to finance, it could also bring in its experience in building industrial plants in the photovoltaic sector and its knowledge in solar cells technology. Germany further reports that for these reasons Evergreen decided to choose Q-Cells as joint venture partner and not […], who was a stronger financial party but wanted more influence.\n(57)\nAt the time of concluding the MVJA1 with Evergreen, Q-Cells had already invested in a large project for the production of conventional solar cells. It had only limited resources available for investment in other projects. According to Germany, the purpose of Q-Cells’ participation in Sovello was to gain knowledge in new technologies for the production of solar wafers, cells and modules, as well as to exploit its experience in the development of solar cell plants.\n(58)\nFor the above reasons, Q-Cells accepted a minority participation of 24,9 %. Germany mentions that in the same logic, Q-Cells had taken a similar minority participation (21,19 %) in CSG Solar AG (24), a company producing solar modules based on the thin-film technology. The level of the participation is not only based on the possible financial contribution but also on the technological input.\n(59)\nGermany stresses that the participation quotes of the shareholders in Sovello fully represented the real intention and influence of both joint venture partners, and that the voting rights were shared accordingly. This resulted in the factual situation that Evergreen could take important business decisions on its own, while Q-Cells did not have this possibility.\n(60)\nGermany argues that a potential future increase of Q-Cells’ participation was agreed but was subject to certain conditions and contribution of corresponding extra capital. One of the conditions mentioned in the MJVA1 was that such a participation increase should not jeopardise the aid granted to Sovello. Germany points out that the aid measure was the reason for the location of the investment project in Germany instead of the USA, and that this is not in contradiction with State aid rules. Germany adds that Q-Cells had no influence on this, and that it is not illegitimate nor a circumvention of the rules if the joint venture partners aim to safeguard the total financing of Sovello.\n(61)\nGermany is of the view that there is a distinction between influence existing at a certain moment in time and potential future influence based on a possible increase of the participation of Q-Cells. Germany stresses that it was totally uncertain whether this participation increase would take place, and that both parties knew it would not follow quickly and certainly not before the probation of the new technology. In fact, the proposed increase up to 50 % as taken up in the MJVA1 was never realized. Quite to the contrary, on the basis of the second agreement (the MJVA2) dated 22 November 2005, Q-Cells’ participation was lowered to 21 %. According to Germany, this clearly shows that there is no ‘automatism’ allowing to conclude that it was established from the outset that Q-Cells would own more than 24,9 % of Sovello’s shares.\n(62)\nGermany furthermore states that the fact that Q-Cells provided an executive officer for Sovello was only a transitional arrangement (December 2004 until April 2005) which did not reduce the decisive influence of Evergreen, who also provided an executive officer as from the start of the joint venture. Germany adds that based on its majority position in the Supervisory Board, Evergreen had the right to appoint or recall any executive officer.\n(63)\nGermany contests that the formulation in the Heads of Agreement, saying that Q-Cells’ ownership of Sovello must be less than 25 % in order to qualify for certain German government subsidies, would lead to an influence from Q-Cells going beyond its real participation of 24,9 %. Germany rather explains that it only represents what was later taken up in the MJVA1, namely the intention of the parties not to be in breach of any government support conditions. Germany also points to another paragraph in the Heads of Agreement, where it is mentioned that as Sovello operations will represent a substantial majority of the manufacturing capacity of Evergreen, Evergreen will be required to own a majority interest in the equity of Sovello in the near term. Germany finally notes that the Heads of Agreement is only a working base between the parties which was not legally binding.\n(64)\nGermany contests any possible influence of Q-Cells beyond its participation of 24,9 % which could be derived from agreements with Sovello. It stresses that all such agreements were concluded on market conditions and that no further economic, financial, organisational or other relation exists between Q-Cells and Sovello.\n(65)\nGermany concludes that the changes to the distribution of ownership after the foundation of Sovello are not based on the original MJVA1, but are linked with the entry of REC into the joint venture, upon the latter’s agreement to supply large quantities of silicon to Sovello, in exchange of a participation of 15 % in the joint venture (as agreed in the MJVA2). Following this entry, Evergreen lowered its participation by 11,1 % and Q-Cells by 3,9 %. According to Germany, this proves the primary willingness of Q-Cells to remain a minority shareholder. It was only at a later stage, when REC agreed to supply additional silicon, and after the technological success of the Sovello1 investment was proven, that the participations of the three shareholders were brought to an equal 33,3 % (modification of the MJVA2, dated 29 September 2006, effective as from 19 December 2006).\n5.4. Participation of Q-Cells based on German company law\n(66)\nGermany claims that the decisional rights conferred to Q-Cells in the joint venture are not unusual for young technology joint ventures such as Sovello, and are comparable to those given to venture capital investors holding minority financial participations. Q-Cells does not have more influence than that of a minority shareholder. It brought in 24,9 % of the capital, but also its cell manufacturing know-how, and hence wanted some influence on decisions related to the contracts of the joint venture cooperation. Germany argues that these rights to influence certain corporate decisions were necessary to protect Q-Cells, because it was not excluded that otherwise Evergreen could use its influence on the management of Sovello preferentially in its own interest. Germany also adds that it is common practice to allow minority shareholders to appoint a member of the supervisory board.\n(67)\nIn order to indicate that the participation of 24,9 % of Q-Cells is not determined by the intention to obtain a SME bonus, Germany also refers to German company law. On the one hand, Germany points out that the influence of Q-Cells is corresponding to the rules on protection of minority shareholders. In this context Germany refers to §§ 50, 61 and 66 of the GmbH Statute. These articles define certain rights of minority shareholders of a GmbH with a participation of minimum 10 % of the shares such as the right to ask for a shareholder’s meeting, the right to put items on the agenda of the shareholders’ meeting, the right to file a lawsuit in order to liquidate the company etc. According to Germany Q-Cells’ influence does not go beyond what a minority shareholder of a GmbH with a participation of minimum 10 % of the shares is entitled to according to German company law. On the other hand, Germany mentions as further reason for the conferral of the decisional rights to Q-Cells the fact that due to the participation of only 24,9 % Q-Cells did not dispose of a blocking minority, which would have required a participation of more than 25 %. Therefore, the missing protection of Q-Cells by means of law was substituted by the corresponding decisional rights granted on the basis of the agreements.\n5.5. Summary\n(68)\nGermany contests the legal grounds on which the Commission initiated the procedure, arguing that at the time of notification it submitted complete and correct information, and that hence Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 659/1999 is not applicable. Germany also claims that the Commission should only base its assessment of the SME status of a company on the respect of the formal criteria (staff headcount and financial ceilings) of the SME definition, and not add ‘unwritten criteria’ to verify whether a company suffers from typical SME handicaps. Germany contests that the SME bonus was obtained by Sovello in breach of the State aid rules, and claims that the Commission’s allegations of possible manipulation cannot be maintained.\n(69)\nGermany states that at the time of notification, Sovello fulfilled the conditions of the SME definition: Q-Cells only held a minority participation of 24,9 % in Sovello, and was nor a partner nor a linked enterprise with Sovello in the sense of the SME definition. Therefore, no data from Q-Cells were to be taken into account for the calculation of the SME thresholds. Germany contests that the influence of Q-Cells on Sovello at the time of notification was higher than that of an investor owning 24,9 % of the shares. Moreover, Germany is of the opinion that Sovello suffered indeed from the typical handicaps of an SME, and that without the State aid including the SME bonus, the investment project would not have been carried out.\n6. ASSESSMENT OF THE AID\n6.1. Preliminary remarks\n(70)\nOn 7 June 2006, the Commission approved a SME bonus of 15 % GGE (granted as a top-up to regional aid) for Sovello. Subsequently, the Commission uncovered evidence that this initial Commission decision might have been taken on the basis of incorrect information provided with the original notification and, insofar as that information could constitute a decisive factor for the decision, the Commission decided on 17 June 2008 to open the procedure laid down in Article 108(2) TFEU in respect of the aid at issue, with a view to revoking the decision N 426/05 and adopting a new decision.\n6.2. Notification requirement, legal basis and applicable law\n(71)\nGermany notified the SME bonus to Sovello by letter dated 29 August 2005, registered as received on 1 September 2005.\n(72)\nThe SME bonus to Sovello was granted on 21 April 2005 (subject to Commission approval) as a top-up to regional aid granted lawfully under the German GA scheme. This scheme contains a specific provision (25) requiring Germany to notify individually any award of SME bonuses which exceeds the individual notification threshold of SME block-exemption Regulation. The SME block-exemption Regulation, applicable at the time of notification, exempts investment aid to be given to SMEs at an intensity of 7,5 % net grant equivalent (NGE) for medium-sized companies and 15 % NGE for small companies anywhere within the EU. Where aid is granted in the assisted areas, the SME block-exemption Regulation also exempts aid up to the amount allowed under the RAG 1998 plus the additional SME bonus. The SME block-exemption Regulation does not exempt aid for certain projects with eligible expenses over EUR 25 million, or any project which will receive gross aid in excess of EUR 15 million. Such aid has to be individually notified.\n(73)\nTo establish whether a firm constitutes a SME, the Commission applies the SME Recommendation.\n6.3. Assessment of SME status of Sovello\n6.3.1. Applicability of Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 659/1999\n(74)\nArticle 9 of Regulation (EC) No 659/1999 stipulates that ‘the Commission may revoke a decision (…) after having given the Member State concerned the opportunity to submit its comments, where the decision was based on incorrect information provided during the procedure which was a determining factor for the decision. Before revoking a decision and taking a new decision, the Commission shall open the formal investigation procedure pursuant to Article 4(4). (…)’.\n(75)\nGermany contests to have submitted at any stage of the preliminary examination incorrect, or even incomplete information, as (a) it submitted all information required by the Commission Communication on the Model declaration, and (b) none of the relevant Community tests and provisions contained in the Recommendation required to give additional information on the construction of a joint venture and/or the Articles of Association of a company.\n(76)\nThe Commission Communication on the Model declaration however mentions that the use of the declaration is not mandatory, but designed as a possible example, and that such declarations are without prejudice to the checks or investigations provided for under national or EU rules. In the course of the preliminary investigation, the Commission requested Germany to either submit a declaration under oath from Q-Cells that this shareholder did not fulfil any of the conditions of Article 3(3)(a-d) (26) of the Annex to the SME Recommendation, or, if this was not possible, to provide a copy of the Articles of Association of Sovello. On 28 October 2005, the German authorities submitted such declaration under oath from Q-Cells. As the shareholder structure of Sovello was modified in the course of the preliminary examination of the notified aid by incorporating a third joint venture partner (REC), the German authorities also submitted a declaration under oath from this new shareholder (on 4 April 2006). The decision N 426/05 was taken after a preliminary examination on the basis of the information submitted by Germany.\n(77)\nThe relevant question to be examined by the Commission was whether the beneficiary company was an SME. If at the time of the preliminary examination documents exist which explicitly reflect in writing that the shareholder structure of a joint venture is designed in order to comply with the SME definition, or which show clear intentions to change the company structure, as soon as a SME bonus is secured, it cannot be argued that such information is not at least relevant to assess the SME status of the joint venture in question and would not constitute a determining factor for the Commission decision.\n(78)\nTherefore, as the Commission did not receive any of these documents (Heads of Agreement, Articles of Association, MJVA1 and MJVA2), it had an incomplete view of the relevant factual situation at that time, and hence took its initial positive decision on the SME bonus for Sovello on the basis of incomplete, and thus incorrect information.\n(79)\nThe Commission considers that Germany was under an obligation to submit all information which was available at the time and which was relevant for the decision N 426/05. Therefore, the Commission concludes that the information Germany provided was incomplete and thus incorrect. Consequently Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 659/1999 is applicable, as it is an objective procedure, which allows the Commission to withdraw wrong decisions.\n(80)\nUnder the provisions of the national German rules, Germany was obliged to verify whether any circumvention of the SME definition existed. Indeed, the text of the German scheme (27) on the basis of which the SME bonus was granted explicitly states that the SME status is excluded - even if the formal criteria of the SME definition are fulfilled - in cases where larger enterprises have factual control, or in the case of economic entities which economically speaking cannot be considered an SME.\n6.3.2. Admissibility of ‘additional criteria’ for the assessment of the SME status\n(81)\nGermany argues that as in the SME Recommendation no other than the formal criteria concerning the thresholds are clearly defined, these formal criteria for the determination of the SME status of an enterprise should be decisive, in order to ensure legal certainty and calculability of the Commission State aid control policy. Germany further argues that possible additional criteria could only be envisaged in the context of a review of the SME definition, and not in the context of individual cases.\n(82)\nFor the definition of partner enterprises, the Commission Recommendation does indeed not foresee any other criteria than the 25 % threshold in shares, respectively voting rights. It also does not contain a specific anti-circumvention clause. However, the Commission enjoys a degree of discretionary power in the field of State aid, with a view to protect the internal market against not justifiable distortions of competition.\n(83)\nThe Commission acknowledges the need for legal certainty and transparency in the application of the State aid rules. Therefore, an assessment which goes beyond that of the application of the formal criteria should in any event be limited to very exceptional cases that can be clearly qualified as circumvention.\n(84)\nNevertheless the Commission does not add ‘additional criteria’ to the SME definition, but simply goes beyond a purely formal analysis which must be possible if the Commission has to take an individual decision based on Article 6 of the SME block-exemption Regulation. By doing so the Commission makes sure that the SME bonus is only granted to genuine SMEs for which size truly represents a handicap and not to enterprises which through linked and/or partner enterprises have access to funds and assistance not available to competitors of equal size. In order to ensure that only genuine SMEs are included, there has to be a way of eliminating legal arrangements in which the SME definition is circumvented. Such an approach is in conformity with the findings of the jurisprudence (Solar Tech and Pollmeier cases, see footnotes 20 and 21), where the Courts of the European Union have accepted that the Commission shall refuse the SME bonus where this would lead to circumvention. It is therefore inherent in the definition of an SME that it does not apply where such a risk exists and the criteria are only formally respected.\n(85)\nThe argumentation of Germany that the situation of Sovello is different from that of Solar Tech and Pollmeier, and that this jurisprudence refers to the SME Recommendation of 1996 and hence is not applicable to the current SME definition is not relevant. The key elements of the SME Recommendation of 1996 for the determination of a partner enterprise (share of 25 % or more of the capital or the voting rights) have been taken up and just refined by SME Recommendation 2003/361/EC. Nevertheless as even the most sophisticated criteria may always be circumvented, a control of attempts to circumvent the applicable definition of an SME must in any case be possible. Indeed, it is rather a general principle - no circumvention - which the Courts have accepted.\n6.3.3. Company documents and factual situation\n(86)\nThere are clear indications in the company documents (Heads of Agreement, Articles of Association of Sovello dated 13 January 2005, and MJVA1) that the initial corporate architecture was designed and aimed at obtaining the SME bonus. Point 5 of the Heads of Agreement is most explicit on this issue:\n‘The Parties understand that, in order to qualify for maximum grants, it is in the interest of JVCo that Q restricts its equity portion of JVCo until such time that either E or JVCo are no longer categorised as “small or medium enterprises” under the rules for investment grants etc., or that this restriction becomes null and void. As such, ’. (Underlining added) (28))\n(87)\nThis clear intention is confirmed by Article 2.5(c) of the MJVA1:\n‘The Parties shall use reasonable best efforts by VentureCo; and to obtain the funds necessary to fund to VentureCo the amounts specified in Section 2.4 (b) and 2.4 (c) when due.’(Underlining added)\n(88)\nSeveral elements suggest that from the start the intention of Evergreen and Q-Cells was to give equal power to both partners as soon as the SME bonus was secured:\n-\nThe MJVA1 lays down in its Article 3(6) that, ‘if it is possible under the applicable grant regulations, that Q-Cells increases its ownership interest in Sovello to 50 %, without such increase of Q-Cells’ ownership interest in Sovello possibly resulting in an application for Government Investment Grants being turned down, (…), then Q-Cells shall be offered to increase its ownership interest in Sovello to a level equal to the percentage’ then held by Evergreen. In this context, a preferential price shall apply.\n-\nThe MJVA1 contains in its Article 3(6) even an emergency plan, foreseeing to find other ways than shareholding participation to increase Q-Cells ownership, if necessary:\n‘If at the time of an Additional Financing request the Grant Impunity Notice cannot be obtained, the Parties shall enter into discussions as to whether Q can participate in the Additional Financing to the extent necessary to enable it to , as provided herein, .’ (29) (Underlining added)\n(89)\nThe Commission considers that the provisions contained in the Articles of Association, the Heads of Agreement, and the MJVA1 give Q-Cells a level of influence on Sovello’s business decisions that goes beyond what a minority shareholder with a participation of 24,9 % could expect under normal company law (though in a joint venture arrangement, this is not necessarily unusual). The Heads of Agreement stipulates that:\n‘The Governance of JVCo will generally be structured and balanced to take into account each Party’s relative economic interest in JVCo and the fact that E needs initially to have a higher degree of control of JVCo as a result of the materiality of the operations of JVCo relative to E’s operations on a consolidated basis. At the same time, the JVCo governance structure will include provisions that ’(Underlining added)\n(90)\nIn addition, the Heads of Agreement mentions that the parties will agree to identify certain major corporate actions that require the consent of both parties in a mutually agreed upon manner.\n(91)\nIndeed, the initial Articles of Association of Sovello foresee that:\n-\nThe Supervisory Board is composed of three persons (two nominated by Evergreen, of which the president, who should be ‘acceptable’ for Q-Cells; one by Q-Cells, who is at the same time the substitute president).\n-\nThe agreement of at least one of each of both Evergreen and Q-Cells nominees is required for several important corporate actions (approval of annual plan and balance sheet; strategic decisions concerning timing and volume of production, capacity extension, sale of wafers/cells additionally to module; definition of brands and brand names; agreements concerning intellectual property…).\n(92)\nAs a consequence, since Q-Cells has substantial decisional rights, the German argument that Evergreen needed a participation exceeding 75 % to protect its interests (and thus the 24,9 % participation of Q-Cells is justified by other than circumvention-considerations) cannot be upheld. The Commission notes that Evergreen indeed desired to initially have a majority interest in Sovello (as stated in point 5 of the Heads of Agreement: ‘E will be required to own a majority interest in the equity of JVCo in the near term’), but such majority could also be achieved with another participation percentage (between 51 % and 75 %).\n(93)\nThe influence of Q-Cells on strategic decisions is confirmed by Evergreen’s annual report 2004 which mentions that:\n‘the strategic partnership is ’, (Underlining added)\nand that:\n‘although initially a minority shareholder in the strategic partnership, ; as a result, we may be unable to take certain actions that we believe would be in our best interests, which, given the expected materiality of the strategic partnership to our combined operations, could significantly harm our business; further, we may be liable to third parties for the material decisions and actions of Q-Cells in the strategic partnership, which actions may harm the strategic partnership and our business’. (Underlining added)\n(94)\nThe following extracts from the Heads of Agreement demonstrate that the role of Q-Cells in Sovello was essential for the operability of the joint venture:\n‘It is anticipated that because the facility will be located in Germany near Q’s current operations, that Q will be a major source of transferred and seconded employees for JVCo. In addition, initially Q will take primary responsibility for recruiting new employees for the facility.’\n‘JVCo may outsource to a Party on a permanent or temporary basis, certain services (Infrastructure, management, operational, technology support and development, etc.) that can be provided by a party to JVCo on a more cost effective basis than if JVCo were to provide such services itself. In particular for the early phases of JVCo, both Parties commit to enter into agreements to supply necessary services to JVCo for a period of at least 2 years, until JVCo is in a position to function cost effectively without this support from its owner entities.’\n‘For example, it is anticipated that because of the proximity of the JVCo facility to Q, that Q will be in a position to effectively provide JVCo with infrastructure services until such time as JVCo is able to provide such services independently.’\n(95)\nThe MJVA1 also lists a whole range of services which may be provided to Sovello (by both parties Q-Cells and Evergreen): general advice regarding management issues, assistance with respect to Government investment grant application process, assistance with German permit applications, assistance with German management staff selection and recruitment process, Assistance with tax issues, advice regarding corporate and organizational structure, Advice and support regarding financing activities, making the parties’ suppliers available, advice in connection with the transfer of the Parties’ technology, technology support, local infrastructure purchasing, human resources and recruitment support (Article 9.9 of the MJVA1). It is true that the texts mention that these services will be provided on a market-rate or cost-plus basis, but the above shows that there are close relations between Sovello and Q-Cells.\n(96)\nA press release issued by the parties on 24 January 2005 states that ‘The proposed facility is expected to be constructed on property near Q-Cells’ existing solar cell factories, and should therefore capture strong synergies with Q-Cells’ operations.’\n(97)\nFurthermore, Q-Cells acquired the shelf-company for the creation of Sovello, and the managing directors of this company were the CEO of Q-Cells and the CFO of Q-Cells, whereas the COO of Q-Cells had signing authority.\n(98)\nQ-Cells provided an executive officer to Sovello, and even if Germany argues that this was only a transitional arrangement, and that Evergreen also provided an executive officer, this nevertheless is again an indication that the relations between Q-Cells and Sovello were very close, at least at the start of the joint venture.\n(99)\nGermany argued that Evergreen had negotiated with other possible joint venture partners on the basis of a participation exceeding 75 %, but failed to submit evidence in writing of such negotiations. Germany offered in some correspondence to provide declarations under oath by representatives of Evergreen and Q-Cells on the considerations behind the 24,9 % share, but did finally not submit them.\n(100)\nFor these reasons, the Commission cannot follow the argument that the participation of 24,9 % of Q-Cells results necessarily from German company law and is not determined by the intention to obtain an SME bonus.\n(101)\nThe Commission is not convinced by the German argument that the possibility in the MJVA1 for Q-Cells to increase its participation to 50 % was not only conditional to the maintenance of the State subsidy, but also to a capacity expansion decision of both partners based on economic success of Sovello1, since the provisions of Article 3(6)(c) of the MJVA1 state:\n‘Additional Financing. If, , VentureCo requests in writing from both E and Q additional financing in addition to the Aggregate Equity Funding or Alternative Funding (an “Additional Financing”), and the Shareholders approve the corresponding capital increase in accordance with the Articles of Association (an “Additional Financing Request”), the following shall apply:\n(i)\n(the “Grant Impunity Notice”), that Q increases its ownership interest in VentureCo to 50 %, , in part or in full, or Government Investment Grants already obtained being reclaimed, in part or in full, by the competent authorities, then Q shall be offered in writing to provide such amount of an Additional Financing to enable it to increase its ownership interest in VentureCo to a level equal to (but not in excess of) the percentage then held by E (…).’(Underlining added)\n(102)\nAs a conclusion, upon careful analysis of different company documents, the Commission considers that at the time of the original notification, the formal ownership and decisional structure of Sovello, including both the 24,9 % share of Q-Cells and substantial influence of Q-Cells on Sovello decision making, was indeed deliberately and essentially designed to enable Sovello to obtain the SME bonus, whilst at the same time it was always the objective of the two strategic partners to establish the partnership on equal terms, once the SME bonus was obtained.\n(103)\nGermany argues also that the participation of Q-Cells is based on German company law. Germany argued in particular that the successful development of the Sovello joint venture was of such importance for the economic success of Evergreen that Evergreen wanted to keep a maximum of decisional rights and influence on Sovello, and therefore did not accept, for the first phase of development of Sovello, to have shares and voting rights which did not exceed 75 %. This argument can only be understood to mean that Evergreen was not prepared to give shares and voting rights to Q-Cells which would have exceeded 25 %.\n(104)\nTo understand and assess the credibility of this line of argumentation, the Commission verified the provisions of the German GmbH Statute which is the applicable national law since Sovello AG was at the time EverQ GmbH, and fell under its provisions.\n(105)\nThe German GmbH Statute creates certain statutory minority rights in several paragraphs, in particular in §§ 50, 61, 66, and 53. The minority rights contained in §§ 50, 61, and 66 refer to rights of shareholders exceeding 10 % of votes, and are therefore irrelevant for the present assessment, since they are acquired by Q-Cells. Only § 53 contains a minority right which is not obtained by statute by Q-Cells by virtue of its share of 24,9 %. According to § 53, a minority of more than 25 % of the voting rights is entitled to block a modification of the Articles of Association of the limited company. By sole application of the law, Evergreen, as majority shareholder with voting rights exceeding 75 % could thus indeed take all important business decisions, including on changes to the Articles of Association. If the decisional rights included in the provisions of the Articles of Association and the MJVA did not contain additional decisional rights in favour of Q-Cells, the argument brought forward by Germany that Evergreen needed a share exceeding 75 % was credible, and the 24,9 % share of Q-Cells could be justified as the consequence of strict application of statutory rights, and could therefore be considered not to reflect an artificial corporate architecture aimed at circumventing the SME definition.\n(106)\nHowever, under German company law, and notwithstanding the respect of the statutory provisions, freedom of contract applies, and the company’s articles of association may contain provisions that give protection exceeding that foreseen by statute.\n(107)\nThis is exactly the situation of Sovello where the parties laid down in the Articles of Association that both of them have to agree to all important decisions, especially to a modification of the articles. If unanimity - like in the present case - is agreed, then the rule above does not apply, because it shall only protect the rights of a minority shareholder, but not restrict his rights. On the other hand, nothing of course would have restricted the parties’ freedom to insert the same clause in the Articles of Association, if they had not agreed on a share of 24,9 %, but on a different share for Q-Cells. Therefore, in the case at hand the argument referring to the blocking rights of minority shareholders is not relevant. The German statements are therefore contradictory in itself; the statutory rights of a majority shareholder with a majority exceeding 75 % are an irrelevant argument when the substantial decisional rights given by that majority are limited by contract. In view of the above, the Commission concludes that under German company law there is no reason to choose a percentage of 24,9 %. The temporary reduction of Q-Cells shares following the entry of REC into the joint venture which was only upheld until three months after the initial approval of the SME bonus by the Commission, does not change this analysis.\n(108)\nGermany argues that in November 2005 (with the entry of REC acquiring 15 % of the shares), and thus before the Commission took the decision N 426/05 on the SME bonus, both (1) the MJVA1 was abolished and replaced by the MJVA2, and (2) the participation of Q-Cells was lowered to 21 %.\n(109)\nIn general, the Commission assesses a case on the basis of the facts as they exist at the moment of the notification, unless the Member State explicitly modifies the notification. However, in a case where a company is already not an SME (even if the SME thresholds were formally respected) at the time of the original notification, and in a context of possible circumvention of the SME definition, the Commission would be particularly vigilant in checking subsequent changes which were communicated to the Commission after the original notification. In any event, in the present case, the modifications of the shareholder structure communicated to the Commission after the original notification cannot change the legal assessment. Indeed, the alleged intention to artificially keep the ownership of Q-Cells below 25 % was not altered by the later changes to the company structure (before the decision N 426/05 on the SME bonus), and the strong role of Q-Cells in Sovello is maintained in the MJVA2.\n(110)\nThe fact that the role of Q-Cells in the initial joint venture exceeded its 24,9 % share is also confirmed by the MJVA2, which provides that if part of the grants will have to be reimbursed, the three partners will lend the amount to be repaid to Sovello based on the following arrangement: REC will make a loan in proportion to its ownership percentage and the rest of the loan will be split evenly between Evergreen and Q-Cells.\n(111)\nThe rules after REC joined the joint venture are set out in the MJVA2. The MJVA2 provides that following an Additional Financing request, be it linked to capacity expansion or otherwise, Q-Cells may increase its participation up to the same level as Evergreen (Art. 3.5.c). Subject to a further silicon supply contract signed before […], REC may increase its shares up to 21 %, obtaining 6 % from Evergreen (Art. 3.4). In the case of Additional Financing, and still subject to a further silicon supply contract, REC will be entitled to increase its shareholding in Sovello to 33,3 % (Art. 3.5.d), i.e. the same level as Evergreen and Q-Cells. The internal company decision to expand its capacity was taken end June 2006. Equal participation of the three partners was agreed about three months after the initial Commission approval of the SME bonus, when both Q-Cells and REC increased their participation to 33,3 % (amended MJVA2).\n(112)\nThe rules on the appointment of directors and the decisional procedures in the supervisory board are largely maintained: under the MJVA2, both Q-Cells and REC have the right to appoint one director (two, once their participation exceeds 30 %), and decisions are taken by the majority of directors, with the proviso that at least two of the three owner firms must agree. Again, this goes beyond the decisional powers a minority shareholder may expect in a normal company situation (although maybe less unusual in a joint venture).\n(113)\nFurthermore, it was Q-Cells who brought REC into the joint venture. Q-Cells had close customer and supplier relationships with REC and its subsidiaries ScanModule AB, Glava, Sweden (‘ScanModule’), ScanCell AS, Narvik, Norway (‘ScanCell’), and ScanWafer ASA, Høvik, Glomfjord, Porsgrunn, Norway. Indeed, REC supplied silicon and was the main wafer supplier to Q-Cells, and Q-Cells sold an important part of its cell production to ScanModule. The cells produced by ScanCell were sold on the market by Q-Cells. Moreover, in 2004 a verbal agreement was concluded between Q-Cells and REC with regard to sales and marketing support services on the part of Q-Cells in Norway. In addition, clear links also exist through M. Brenninkmeijer, who was member of the supervisory board of both Q-Cells and REC, and also managing director of Good Energies, the company which held 16 % of the shares of Q-Cells and 39 % of the shares of REC (see point 2.2). A similar structure was created for CSG Solar, where both Q-Cells and REC were minority shareholders and Q-Cells’ CEO as well as M. Brenninkmeijer were members of the supervisory board.\n(114)\nAs a consequence of the above considerations the Commission considers that both at the time of notification and the time of the decision N 426/05, the formal ownership and decisional structure of Sovello was deliberately designed to enable Sovello to obtain the SME bonus (by keeping the participation of Q-Cells below 25 %), whilst at the same time it was always the objective of the two, later three strategic partners (REC ensuring the availability of silicon) to establish the partnership on equal terms, once the SME bonus was obtained. Indeed, three months after the Commission approval of the SME bonus, an amendment to the MJVA2 conferred equal participation (33,3 % each) to the three partners.\n6.3.4. Calculation of the SME threshold assuming that Q-Cells holds 25 %\n(115)\nAccording to Article 2 of the Annex to the SME Recommendation, small and medium-sized enterprises are defined as enterprises which\n-\nhave fewer than 250 employees, and\n-\nhave an annual turnover not exceeding EUR 50 million, and/or\n-\nan annual balance-sheet total not exceeding EUR 43 million.\n(116)\nThe calculation of these thresholds depends on the structure of the target company (if it is an autonomous or partner/linked enterprise according to Article 3 of the Annex to the SME Recommendation). According to Article 4 of the Annex to the SME Recommendation, the data relevant for the staff headcount and the financial amounts to determine whether the beneficiary of an aid is an SME are those relating to the last approved accounting period and calculated on an annual basis. According to Article 6 of the Annex to the SME Recommendation, data of linked/partner enterprises have to be taken into account for the calculation of the SME thresholds (100 % for linked enterprises, and a proportion reflecting their participation for partner enterprises, i.e. minimum 25 %).\n(117)\nAs a consequence of all the above considerations, the Commission considers that Q-Cells should have been qualified as a partner enterprise (as if it held 25 %) of Sovello in the original decision if the Commission had been provided with all relevant information. On this basis, the Commission recalculated the SME thresholds for Sovello as defined in the SME Recommendation.\n(118)\nBased on its majority share, Evergreen was a linked enterprise to Sovello. On this basis, 100 % of its data has to be taken into account for the calculation of the SME thresholds. The data used for Evergreen relate to the year 2004 (215 employees, an annual turnover of EUR 18,9 million and a balance sheet total of EUR 36,5 million). In the same year, Sovello had no employees, no turnover and a balance sheet of EUR 0,025 million. End 2004, Q-Cells had 350 employees, an annual turnover of EUR 128,7 million and a balance sheet total of EUR 105,6 million.\n(119)\nThe Commission recalculated the SME thresholds for Sovello including 100 % of the staff headcount, turnover and balance sheet for Sovello itself (data as submitted with the notification), 100 % of the data for Evergreen (linked enterprise, data end 2004 as submitted with the notification), and 25 % of the data for Q-Cells. Based on this calculation, all SME thresholds are exceeded and hence Sovello would not qualify for the SME status and thus not be entitled to receive an SME bonus.\n(120)\nGermany claims that the Commission seems to assume that a joint venture should be automatically treated as one economic entity together with its joint venture partners, thereby developing and applying particular SME criteria for joint ventures. The Commission observes that the assessment of the present case demonstrates that this argument is not valid. Indeed, in line with Article 6 of the SME Recommendation, the Commission only took the pro rata (25 %) data of Q-Cells into account, as it considers that the participation of Q-Cells was artificially kept below this threshold.\n6.4. Lack of necessity of the SME bonus\n(121)\nAs the SME thresholds are exceeded, there is no need to further investigate if Sovello really suffered from SME handicaps and if the granting of the SME bonus was therefore necessary. Germany nevertheless lists several ‘SME handicaps’ from which Sovello would have suffered (see point 5.2). As for the limited access to finance, and the German argument that without SME bonus the investment would not have been carried out, the Commission notes that the MJVA1 foresees ways to try to obtain ‘Alternative Financing’ in case of a shortfall of government subsidies. The MJVA2 foresees compensation of grant repayment obligations by the three joint venture partners (through a loan to Sovello, see recital 110). The Commission is therefore not convinced that the investment would not have taken place without the SME bonus. As for the commercial risk, the Commission takes the view that it is compensated by the possibility for Sovello to rely on the combined experience of Evergreen (for distribution and sales), Q-Cells (presence on the German market) and REC (active on the solar modules market through its subsidiaries) (see recital 113). The Commission rejects the German argument that Sovello had higher operational and business costs than large enterprises, as it received substantial support from Q-Cells, as described in recitals 94 and 95, and had secured access to silicon through REC (which was a serious bottle-neck for the solar industry in 2005).\n(122)\nAt any event, the Commission considers that its assessment based on the new information demonstrates that through its joint venture partners active in the same industrial sector Sovello potentially had access to funds and assistance not available to competitors of equal size which were not supported by linked or partner enterprises. Contrary to the German argumentation, the Commission therefore concludes that the SME bonus granted to Sovello was not necessary in order to ensure the financing of the investment.\n6.5. Conclusion\n(123)\nAs a result, the Commission considers that Sovello was not eligible for the SME bonus of 15 %, and the SME bonus granted is incompatible with the internal market.\n(124)\nPursuant to Article 14(1) of Regulation (EC) No 659/1999, the Commission is in principle under an obligation to order the recovery of this incompatible aid from the beneficiary,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\nArticle 1\nThe Decision adopted on 7 June 2006 in State aid case N 426/05 is hereby revoked.\nArticle 2\nThe State aid amounting to EUR 9 130 995 in prices of 2007 unlawfully granted by Germany, in breach of Article 108(3) TFEU, in favour of Sovello is incompatible with the internal market.\nArticle 3\n1. Germany shall recover the aid referred to in Article 2 from the beneficiary.\n2. The sums to be recovered shall bear interest from the date on which they were put at the disposal of the beneficiary until their actual recovery.\n3.

PROCEDURE\n1.1. Measures repealed\n(1)\nOn 6 March 2004, the Commission initiated a safeguard investigation, pursuant to Council Regulations 3285/94 (2) and 519/94 (3), concerning imports of farmed salmon. On 5 February 2005 the Commission imposed, by Regulation (EC) No 206/2005 (4) definitive safeguard measures which took the form of tariff quotas combined with a minimum price for imports. The definitive safeguard measures apply from 6 February 2005, and are subject to gradual liberalisation during the period of their application. On 23 April 2005, the Commission repealed Commission Regulation (EC) No 206/2005 by Commission Regulation (EC) No 627/2005 (5).\n1.2. Initiation\n(2)\nIn parallel to the safeguard investigation, on 8 September 2004 a complaint concerning imports of farmed salmon originating in Norway was lodged by the EU Salmon Producers' Group (the complainant) representing a major proportion of the Community production of farmed salmon.\n(3)\nThis complaint contained evidence of dumping of the said product and of material injury resulting there from, which was considered sufficient to justify the opening of a proceeding.\n(4)\nOn 23 October 2004 the proceeding was opened by the publication of a notice of initiation (6)\n1.3. Investigation period\n(5)\nThe investigation of dumping and injury covered the period from 1 October 2003 to 30 September 2004 (‘investigation period’ or ‘IP’). With respect to the trends relevant for the injury assessment, the Commission analysed data covering the period from 1 January 2001 to 30 September 2004 (‘period considered’). The period used for the findings on undercutting, underselling and injury elimination is the aforementioned IP.\n1.4. Parties concerned by the proceeding\n(6)\nThe Commission officially advised the complainant, Norwegian producers, traders, importers, suppliers and users known to be concerned, as well as associations known to be concerned and representatives of Norway, of the opening of the proceeding. Interested parties were given an opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing within the time limit set in the notice of initiation.\n(7)\nThe Commission sought and verified all the information deemed necessary for a provisional determination of dumping, resulting injury and Community interest. To this end, the Commission sent questionnaires to all parties known to be concerned and to all the other exporters that made themselves known within the deadlines set out in the notice of initiation. In this regard, the following interested parties cooperated with the Commission and made their views known: 102 Norwegian exporters and traders; 24 Community producers; one association of Community producers; 15 importers users and processors; four users’ associations; one consumer’s association; and two suppliers. Verification visits were carried out at the premises of the following companies:\n(a)\nProducers in the Community\n-\nCeltic Atlantic Salmon Ltd (Killary), Renvyle, Co Galway, Ireland.\n-\nHoove Salmon Ltd, Whiteness Shetland, United Kingdom.\n-\nLoch Duart Ltd, Scourie By Lairg, Sutherland, Scotland, United Kingdom.\n-\nOrkney Sea Farms Ltd, Glasgow, United Kingdom.\n-\nWest Minch Salmon Ltd, Sidinish Salmon Ltd, Benbecula, Western Isles, United Kingdom.\n-\nWester Ross Salmon, Inverness, United Kingdom.\n(b)\nExporters\n-\nMarine Harvest Bolga AS, N-8158 Bolga, Norway.\n-\nFjord Seafood Norway AS, Toftsundet, N-8900 Brønnøysund, Norway.\n-\nPan Fish Norway AS, Grimmergata 5, N-6002 Ålesund, Norway.\n-\nStolt Sea Farm AS, Postboks 370, Sentrum, N-0102, Oslo, Norway.\n-\nFollalaks AS, N-8286 Nordfold, Norway.\n-\nNordlaks Oppdrett AS, Boks 224, N-8455 Stokmarknes, Norway.\n-\nHydrotech AS, Bentnesveien 50, N-6512 Kristiansund, Norway.\n-\nGrieg Seafood AS, Postboks 234, N-5804 Bergen, Norway.\n-\nSeafarm Invest AS, N-8764 Lovund, Norway.\n-\nSinkaberg-Hansen AS, Postboks 134, N-7901 Rorvik, Norway.\n(c)\nImporters/Processors/Users\n-\nLabeyrie, St. Vincent de Tyrosse, France.\n-\nLaschinger GmbH, Bischofsmais, Germany.\n(8)\nAll interested parties, who so requested and showed that there were particular reasons why they should be heard, were granted a hearing.\n(9)\nIn the notice of initiation, the Commission indicated that in view of the apparent large number of exporters of the product concerned in Norway and the large number of producers of the product in the Community, the application of sampling techniques was envisaged in this investigation.\n2. PRODUCT CONCERNED AND LIKE PRODUCT\n2.1. Product concerned\n(10)\nThe product concerned is farmed (other than wild) salmon, whether or not filleted, fresh, chilled or frozen. The definition excludes other similar farmed fish products such as large (salmon) trout, biomass (live salmon) as well as wild salmon and further processed types such as smoked salmon.\n(11)\nThe product is currently classifiable within CN codes ex 0302 12 00, ex 0303 11 00, ex 0303 19 00, ex 0303 22 00, ex 0304 10 13 and ex 0304 20 13 corresponding to different presentations of the product (fresh or chilled fish, fresh or chilled fillets, frozen fish and frozen fillets). Based on the physical characteristics, the production process and the substitutability of the product from the perspective of the consumer, it was found that all farmed salmon constitutes a single product. The different presentations all serve the same end use and are readily capable of being substituted between each other. Therefore, they are considered to constitute a single product for the purpose of the proceeding.\n2.2. Like product\n(12)\nThe investigation showed that the basic physical characteristics of farmed salmon produced and sold by the Community industry in the Community, farmed salmon produced and sold on the domestic Norwegian market, and farmed salmon imported into the Community from Norway are the same and that they have the same use.\n(13)\nIn reaching this determination, the following findings in particular were taken into account:\n-\nthe product concerned and the Community product share the same international classification for tariff purposes. Furthermore, they share the same or similar physical properties such as taste, size, shape and texture;\n-\nthe product concerned and the Community product were sold via similar or identical sales channels, price information was readily available to buyers and the product concerned and the product of the Community producers competed mainly on price;\n-\nthe product concerned and the Community product both serve the same or similar end-uses, they were, therefore, alternative or substitute products and were easily interchangeable.\n(14)\nIt was therefore provisionally concluded that the product concerned and the farmed salmon produced and sold on the domestic market of Norway, as well as the farmed salmon produced and sold in the Community by the Community industry have the same basic physical characteristics and uses and are therefore considered to be alike within the meaning of Article 1(4) of the basic Regulation.\n3. DUMPING\n3.1. General\n(15)\nAlthough most Norwegian producers of farmed salmon sold the product concerned to the Community via traders, it was possible to make the dumping assessment at the level of the producers. Indeed, following changes in the structure of the Norwegian salmon industry, it was found that most Norwegian producers of farmed salmon were making sales of the product concerned either direct to the EU, or were able to identify sales made via unrelated traders and destined for the EU market. It was therefore possible to arrive at both a normal value and an export price at the level of the producer.\n3.2. Sampling\n(16)\nSection 5.1(a) of the notice of initiation indicated that the Commission may decide to apply sampling in accordance with Article 17 of the basic Regulation. In response to the request pursuant to Section 5.1(a)(i) of the notice of initiation, 102 companies provided the information requested within the specified deadline. Of these, 38 were producers of farmed salmon, which also exported the product concerned to the EU (the ‘exporting producers’). Sales were either made direct or via unrelated traders.\n(17)\nIn view of the large number of companies involved, it was decided to make use of the provisions for sampling and, for this purpose, a sample of companies, with the largest export volumes to the EC was chosen, in consultation with the Norwegian authorities. There were some issues that could not be resolved with the Norwegian authorities, in particular concerning the exclusion from the sample of certain exporters with relatively low export volumes to the EC of the product concerned. The requests made by the Norwegian authorities would have meant that the principle for selection of the sample, i.e. to include as many companies that could reasonably be investigated within the time available with the largest possible representative volume of exports, would not have been respected. Therefore those claims could not be accepted. The sample comprises the ten largest Norwegian exporting producers, representing almost 80 % of the export volume to the Community of all co-operating exporting producers.\n(18)\nFollowing verification, for two companies included in the sample it was not possible to conclude on the basis of the information provided that sales of farmed salmon had been made to unrelated parties at arms length prices. In these circumstances, it is provisionally concluded that, pending the provision of sufficient information by these companies, these companies should not be given an individual dumping margin, but should be allocated the weighted average margin of those companies for which an individual margin could be established. However, it should be noted that the Commission will continue to investigate this issue at the definitive stage of the proceeding, and may revert to use of facts available in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation, should the necessary information not be made available by the companies concerned.\n3.3. Normal value\n(19)\nFor the determination of normal value the Commission first established, for each of the exporting producers included in the sample, whether its total domestic sales of farmed salmon were representative in comparison with its total export sales to the Community. In accordance with Article 2(2) of the basic Regulation, domestic sales were considered representative when the total domestic sales volume of each exporting producer was at least 5 % of its total export sales volume to the Community.\n(20)\nFor the exporting producers having overall representative domestic sales, the Commission subsequently identified the types of farmed salmon sold domestically which were identical or directly comparable to the types sold for export to the Community.\n(21)\nFor each of those types, it was established whether domestic sales were sufficiently representative for the purposes of Article 2(2) of the basic Regulation. Domestic sales of a particular type were considered sufficiently representative when the total domestic sales volume of that type during the IP represented 5 % or more of the total sales volume of the comparable type exported to the Community.\n(22)\nAn examination was also made as to whether the domestic sales of each type of the product concerned sold domestically in representative quantities could be regarded as having been made in the ordinary course of trade in accordance with Article 2(4) of the basic Regulation, by establishing the proportion of profitable sales to independent customers of the type in question.\n(23)\nIn cases where the sales volume of a type of farmed salmon, sold at a net sales price equal to or above its cost of production, represented more than 80 % of the total sales volume of that type, and where the weighted average price of that type was equal to or above its cost of production, normal value was based on the actual domestic price. This price was calculated as a weighted average of the prices of all domestic sales of that type made during the IP, irrespective of whether these sales were profitable or not.\n(24)\nWhere the volume of profitable sales of a type of farmed salmon represented 80 % or less of the total sales volume of that type, or where the weighted average price of that type was below its cost of production, normal value was based on the actual domestic price, which was calculated as a weighted average of profitable sales of that type only, provided that these sales represented 10 % or more of the total sales volume of that type.\n(25)\nFinally, where the volume of profitable sales of any type of farmed salmon represented less than 10 % of the total sales volume of that type, it was considered that this particular type was sold in insufficient quantities for the domestic price to provide an appropriate basis for the establishment of the normal value.\n(26)\nWherever domestic prices of a particular type sold by an exporting producer could not be used, constructed normal value was used, pursuant to Article 2(3) of the basic Regulation. In accordance with Article 2(3) of the basic Regulation, normal value was constructed by adding to each exporter’s manufacturing costs of the exported types, adjusted where necessary, a reasonable amount for selling, general and administrative expenses (‘SG&A’) and a reasonable margin of profit. To this end, the Commission examined whether the SG&A incurred and the profit realised by each of the exporting producers concerned on the domestic market constituted reliable data.\n(27)\nThe actual domestic profit margin was considered reliable when the total domestic sales volume of the company concerned could be regarded as representative as compared to the volume of export sales to the Community. For companies with overall representative sales, the profit margin was determined on the basis of domestic sales of those types that were sold in the ordinary course of trade. For this purpose, the methodology set out in recital 22 to 25 was applied.\n(28)\nWhere these criteria were not met, the Commission next considered whether a weighted average profit margin of the other companies with representative sales in the ordinary course of trade in Norway could be used, or the actual amounts applicable to production and sales, in the ordinary course of trade, of the same general category of products of the company concerned in their domestic market, could be used. Finally, where none of these approaches was possible, the domestic profit margin was established in accordance with Article 2(6)(c) of the basic Regulation.\n(29)\nFive companies had overall representative sales but it was found that for only one company were certain types of the product concerned, which were also exported, sold on the domestic market in the ordinary course of trade. For the remaining types of farmed salmon exported by these companies, normal value had to be constructed following the methodology explained in recital 26. Three companies were found not to have overall representative domestic sales of farmed salmon. Therefore, normal value had to be constructed for all types of the product concerned produced by these companies following the methodology explained in recital 26.\n(30)\nAs indicated in recital 29, in respect of domestic profit margin, it was found that only one exporting producer had domestic sales of farmed salmon in the ordinary course of trade. As this was not considered sufficiently representative, a domestic profit of 8 % on turnover was provisionally taken in line with the approach outlined in recital 28. Such a profit margin was considered the minimum level that would be achievable for a viable industry. In addition, it should be noted that the domestic profit used was in the same order as that achieved by the company that did have domestic sales in the ordinary course of trade. This profit margin also seems to be the absolute minimum in view of the significant investment both in time and resources required to farm salmon, which have a three year growing cycle from smolt to harvestable fish. The Commission will continue to consider the issue of domestic profit in light of this investment burden, combined with the level of current interest rates in Norway and may revise its decision at the definitive stage.\n(31)\nFor determination of a reasonable amount for SG&A, the Commission considered that the company specific information provided by exporting producers could provisionally be used at this stage. However, it should be noted that a number of issues, on which the appropriateness of this approach depends, still need to be clarified and further verified. The Commission will continue to investigate this issue and may decide to revise its approach at the definitive stage.\n3.4. Export price\n(32)\nIn all cases where the product concerned was exported to the Community by way of sales to independent customers, the export price was established in accordance with Article 2(8) of the basic Regulation, namely on the basis of export prices actually paid or payable.\n(33)\nWhere sales were made via a related importer in the Community, the export price was constructed on the basis of the resale prices of the importer to independent customers. Adjustments were made for all costs incurred between importation and resale by the related company, including SG&A expenses, and a reasonable profit margin of 5 % on turnover, in accordance with Article 2(9) of the basic Regulation.\n(34)\nWhere export sales were made via a related trader in Norway, the export price was established on the basis of the resale price paid by the first independent buyer in the Community.\n3.5. Comparison\n(35)\nThe normal value and export prices were compared on an ex-works basis. For the purpose of ensuring a fair comparison between the normal value and the export price, due allowance in the form of adjustments was made for differences affecting prices and price comparability in accordance with Article 2(10) of the basic Regulation. Appropriate adjustments concerning transport and insurance, credit, commission, bank charges, packing, customs duties and rebates were granted in all cases where they were found to be reasonable, accurate and supported by verified evidence. Adjustments were also made where the export sales were made via a related company located in Norway, pursuant to Article 2(10)(i) of the basic Regulation.\n3.6. Dumping margin\n3.6.1. Sampled Companies\n(36)\nFor eight of the exporting producers which were included in the sample, an individual dumping margin could be calculated. For these companies, the weighted average normal value of each type of the product concerned exported to the Community was compared with the weighted average export price of the corresponding type of the product concerned, as provided for under Article 2(11) of the basic Regulation. Where exporting producers are related, the provisional dumping margin expressed as a percentage of the CIF import price at the Community border has been calculated as the weighted average of the dumping margins of the related companies, in line with the Community’s policy for related exporting producers. Such a circumstance arose in respect of two companies in this investigation.\n(37)\nThe remaining two exporting producers for which it was not possible to establish an individual dumping calculation, as outlined in recital 18, were also attributed a provisional dumping margin at the level of the weighted average of the individual dumping margins provisionally established for the parties in the sample.\n3.6.2. Non-Sampled Companies\n(38)\nCompanies which co-operated, but which were not selected in the sample, and which are not related to any of the companies included in the sample, were attributed a provisional dumping margin at the level of the weighted average of the individual dumping margins provisionally established for the parties in the sample, i.e. 25,1 %.\n(39)\nCompanies which co-operated, but which were not selected in the sample, and which are related to any of the companies included in the sample, were provisionally attributed a provisional dumping margin at the same level as that attributed to the sampled company to which they are related.\n3.6.3. Non-Cooperating Companies\n(40)\nIn order to calculate the residual dumping margin, i.e. the dumping margin for exporters in Norway which did not cooperate or did not make themselves known, the Commission first established the level of co-operation. A comparison was made between the total imports of the product concerned originating in Norway calculated on the basis of Eurostat and the actual data received from exporting producers in Norway which indicated their willingness to be included in a sample. On this basis, it was established that the level of co-operation was high, i.e. almost 80 % of the overall Norwegian exports of farmed salmon to the Community.\n(41)\nFrom the information available, it was concluded that these companies did not dump at a level lower than any of the companies included in the sample. The residual dumping margin was consequently set at the level of the highest individual dumping margin established for a cooperating company. On this basis, the residual level of dumping was provisionally established at 44,0 % of the CIF Community frontier price.\n3.6.4. Dumping Margin\n(42)\nOn this basis, the provisional dumping margins expressed as a percentage of the CIF Community frontier price, duty unpaid, are:\nCompany\nProvisional dumping margin\nMarine Harvest Bolga AS, N-8158 Bolga, Norway\n21,9 %\nFjord Seafood Norway AS, Toftsundet, N-8900 Brønnøysund, Norway\n37,7 %\nPan Fish Norway AS, Grimmergata 5, N-6002 Ålesund, Norway\n25,4 %\nStolt Sea Farm AS, Postboks 370, Sentrum, N-0102, Oslo, Norway\n13,9 %\nFollalaks AS, N-8286 Nordfold, Norway\n24,5 %\nNordlaks Oppdrett AS, Boks 224, N-8455 Stokmarknes, Norway\n6,8 %\nHydrotech AS, Bentnesveien 50, N-6512 Kristiansund, Norway\n21,9 %\nGrieg Seafood AS, Postboks 234, N-5804 Bergen, Norway\n22,9 %\nWeighted Average\n22,5 %\nResidual Margin\n37,7 %\n4. INJURY\n4.1. Definition of Community production and Community industry\n(43)\nDuring the IP, farmed salmon was manufactured in the Community by\n-\nCommunity producers which were not related to Norwegian exporters or importers and which were complainants or explicitly supported the complaint;\n-\nCommunity producers which were not related to Norwegian exporters or importers, and which did not take a position on the complaint (‘silents’);\n-\nSeveral other producers which were found to be related to Norwegian exporters or importers (‘related’).\n(44)\nSeveral of the other producers related to Norwegian exporters or importers made themselves known and requested to be included in the definition of the Community production. They also defined themselves as Community industry. However, this claim was rejected on the basis of the provisions of Article 4(1) of the basic Regulation. It was considered, in particular, that the relationship between these related producers and the exporters or importers of the dumped product could be such as to cause the producers concerned to behave differently from non-related producers. Consequently, the output of these other producers was not taken into consideration when calculating Community production.\n(45)\nThe investigation showed that the complaining Community producers had produced around 20 000 tonnes of salmon during the IP. This represents around 90 % of the estimated total Community production of the product concerned. This constitutes a major proportion of the Community production. The complaining Community producers are therefore deemed to constitute the Community industry within the meaning of Articles 4(1) and 5(4) of the basic Regulation.\n4.2. Sampling for injury assessment purposes\n(46)\nIn view of the large number of producers of farmed salmon in the Community, the application of sampling techniques was foreseen in the notice of initiation for the assessment of injury. The selection of the sample of Community producers was based on the largest representative volume of production that could be reasonably investigated within the time available, in accordance with Article 17 of the basic Regulation.\n(47)\nOn the basis of the information provided to the Commission, the six Community producers listed above in recital 7 were initially selected for the sample and were asked to reply to a questionnaire. Verifications at the premises of these companies were carried out. The investigation showed that Celtic Atlantic Salmon Ltd did not produce farmed salmon within the whole period considered and therefore was not in a position to provide all the data and information requested in the questionnaire. Celtic Atlantic Salmon Ltd was established as a company in January 2004 after having purchased certain assets of a salmon producing company which was in receivership and could only provide data with regard to the IP. Consequently, the injury indicators discussed below as from recital 63 have been established on the basis of the verified information provided by the other five companies listed above in recital 7. However, data from Celtic Atlantic Salmon Ltd were used for the purpose of calculating undercutting and underselling.\n(48)\nThe accumulated production of the five Community producers selected for the sample that fully co-operated in the investigation was at around 8 300 tonnes during the IP, or around 37 % of the estimated total Community production of farmed salmon.\n(49)\nThe analysis of injury is based on (a) the performance injury indicators such as sales prices, stocks, profitability, return on investment, cash flow, investments, ability to raise capital and wages, which were established on the basis of the information verified at the level of the sample and (b) the other injury indicators, such as production, production capacity, capacity utilisation, sales volume, market share, growth, employment, productivity and magnitude of the margin of dumping which were established on the basis of data collected at the level of the Community industry as a whole.\n4.3. Community consumption\n(50)\nDuring the period considered the Community consumption developed as follows:\nTable 1\nCommunity consumption\n2001\n2002\n2003\nIP\nTonnes\n527 970\n550 943\n611 101\n607 904\nIndex\n100\n104\n116\n115\nSource: Eurostat and data for Ireland, United Kingdom, France. All figures relate to EU 25.\n(51)\nCommunity consumption was established on the basis of the total production by all producers in the Community plus imports from all third countries minus European Community exports. Production by all producers established in the Community was established on the basis of data provided by the countries where production is located, i.e. Ireland, United Kingdom and France. Imported and exported quantities were derived from Eurostat.\n(52)\nIt should be noted that large scale farming of farmed salmon in the Community is confined to the United Kingdom (Scotland) and Ireland. Certain adjustments were made to convert net weights as reported by Eurostat to round weights or ‘whole fish equivalents’ (WFE) (7) as it is common for comparisons in the industry to be made on WFE basis. Therefore, unless otherwise indicated, the figures for fresh, chilled and frozen salmon excluding fillets and for fresh, chilled and frozen salmon fillets were, depending on the presentation of the salmon, divided by the conversion factors of 0,90 and 0,65 respectively, i.e. the commonly accepted conversion factors by the salmon industry.\n(53)\nThe above table shows that consumption increased between 2001 and 2003 by 16 %. In the IP consumption remained nearly on the same level as in 2003, with a slight decrease of 0,5 %. Overall the increase of consumption over the period considered was as high as 15 %.\n4.4. Imports into the Community from the country concerned\n4.4.1. Volume of the imports concerned\n(54)\nDuring the period considered the volume of the imports from Norway derived from Eurostat data using the methodology described in recital (51) above developed as follows:\nTable 2\nVolume of imports concerned\n2001\n2002\n2003\nIP\nTonnes\n269 126\n294 481\n351 757\n362 492\nIndex\n100\n109\n131\n135\nSource: Eurostat.\n(55)\nThe above table shows that the volume of imports of farmed salmon from Norway increased by 35 % during the period considered. The increase was as high as 31 % between 2001 and 2003 and it further increased by 3 % between 2003 and the IP. In other words, while consumption increased by nearly 80 000 tonnes during the period considered, Norwegian exporters were able to increase their sales on the Community market by 93 000 tonnes, which represents more than the total increase of consumption.\n4.4.2. Market share of the imports concerned\n(56)\nThe market share held by exporting producers in Norway developed as shown below:\nTable 3\nMarket share of the imports from Norway\n2001\n2002\n2003\nIP\n51 %\n53,5 %\n57,6 %\n59,6 %\nIndex\n100\n105\n113\n117\nSource: Eurostat, Community production and exports calculated from data for Ireland, United Kingdom, France and Latvia.\n(57)\nAs was the case for the imports, Norwegian market share has continuously increased during the period considered. Overall, the market share based on import volumes increased by 17 % or 8,6 percentage points during the period considered. The increase between 2002 and the IP was as high as 6,1 percentage points.\n4.4.3. Average prices of dumped imports\n(58)\nThe price evolution of dumped imports from Norway sold on the Community market is shown below.\nTable 4\nAverage price of dumped imports from Norway (EUR/kg)\n2001\n2002\n2003\nIP\n3,13\n3,04\n2,64\n2,64\nIndex\n100\n97\n84\n84\nSource: Eurostat.\n(59)\nOver the period considered the average price of dumped imports decreased by 16 %. The above table also shows a clear coincidence in time between the fall in price which plummeted downwards in 2003 and the surge of dumped imports on the Community market evidenced in recital 54.\n4.4.4. Price undercutting\n(60)\nFor the purposes of calculating the level of price undercutting during the IP, the weighted average sales prices of the sampled Community industry producers were compared to the weighted average export prices of the sampled exporting producers from Norway. This comparison was made for comparable types of farmed salmon and at the same level of trade, namely for sales to the first independent customer. The comparison was made after deduction of rebates and discounts and the prices of the imports were CIF Community frontier, adjusted for customs duties.\n(61)\nThe prices of the sampled Community industry producers were taken at an ex-works level, i.e. excluding transport costs and at levels of trade considered to be comparable to those of the imports concerned. For those sampled Community industry producers which sold their fish at the farm gate with a deduction of a fee paid to a processing factory, an upward adjustment was made to reflect processing and packing costs in order to make their prices comparable to those of other producers in the sample. This adjustment was made on the basis of the costs incurred by other producers in the sample for these activities or on the basis of the actual fee paid to the processing facility.\n(62)\nThe results of the comparison on a weighted-average to weighted average basis showed that during the IP the products concerned originating in Norway were sold in the Community at prices which undercut the Community industry’s prices, when expressed as a percentage of the latter, at around 15 % on average.\n4.5. Situation of the Community industry\n(63)\nIn accordance with Article 3(5) of the basic Regulation, the examination of the impact of the dumped imports on the Community industry included an evaluation of all economic factors and indices having a bearing on the State of the Community industry during the period considered.\n4.5.1. Production, production capacity and capacity utilisation\n(64)\nThe production, the production capacity and the capacity utilization of the Community industry as a whole developed as follows:\nTable 5\nProduction, production capacity and capacity utilisation\n2001\n2002\n2003\nIP\nProduction (tonnes)\n18 118\n20 621\n19 387\n20 536\nIndex\n100\n114\n107\n113\nProduction capacity (tonnes)\n36 994\n37 112\n41 862\n43 662\nIndex\n100\n100\n113\n118\nCapacity utilisation\n49 %\n56 %\n46 %\n47 %\nIndex\n100\n113\n95\n96\nSource: Community industry.\n(65)\nProduction of the Community industry first increased by 14 % between 2001 and 2002. It subsequently decreased by 6 %, but increased again by 5 % in the IP, although remaining below the level of 2002. As shown in the table above, production overall increased by 13 % during the period considered.\n(66)\nDuring the period considered production capacity increased by 18 %. The main increase took place in 2003 (+ 13 %). It should be noted that farmed salmon production in the European Community is effectively limited by government licences specifying the maximum amount of live fish which may be held in the water at any place at any point in time. Capacity figures given are theoretical capacity based on the total quantity licensed rather than the physical fish-holding capacity of the cages and other production material operated by the Community industry. It is therefore considered that these capacity figures are not very meaningful in the analysis.\n(67)\nCapacity utilisation first increased by 13 % between 2001 and 2002 but decreased in 2003 by around 18 % and remained more or less stable in the IP.\n4.5.2. Stocks\n(68)\nIt should be noted that farmed salmon is practically not stocked by the Community industry, but sold immediately after harvesting to downstream industries. Therefore the evaluation of stocks does not appear to be a relevant factor in examining the economic situation of the Community industry.\n4.5.3. Sales volume, market shares, average unit prices in the EC and growth\n(69)\nThe figures below represent the Community industry’s sales to independent customers on the Community market.\nTable 6\nSales volume, market shares, average unit sales prices in the EC\n2001\n2002\n2003\nIP\nSales volume (tonnes)\n17 556\n18 684\n18 997\n19 925\nIndex\n100\n106\n108\n113\nMarket Share\n3,33 %\n3,38 %\n3,11 %\n3,28 %\nIndex\n100\n102\n93\n99\nAverage unit sales prices (EUR/kg)\n3,03\n3,00\n2,61\n2,84\nIndex\n100\n99\n86\n94\nSource: Community industry with regard to sales volume and market share. With regard to average unit sales prices sampled Community industry on ex-farm level.\n(70)\nThe Community industry’s sales volumes have increased between 2001 and the IP by 13 %. In other words, the Community industry was able to increase its sales volume by 2 300 tonnes. This performance should also be seen in the light of the increase in Community consumption which was as high as 80 000 tonnes in the same period.\n(71)\nThe market shares of the Community industry overall decreased during the period considered (- 1 %). It first increased between 2001 and 2002, then sharply decreased in 2003, and increased again in the IP remaining slightly below the market share of the year 2001. Given the small market share of the Community industry, it should be noted that every loss, be it even little, has a large impact on the Community industry.\n(72)\nIn the period 2001 to the IP the Community industry’s average sales prices decreased by 6 %. The main decrease took place between 2002 and 2003 (- 13 percentage points), while between 2003 and the IP, prices recovered to some extent (+ 8 percentage points).\n(73)\nOver the period considered the Community consumption grew by 15 % and the Community industry increased it sales volume by 13 %. However, during the same period Community sales prices decreased (- 6 %) as well as market share (- 1 %). At the same time the imports from Norway increased by around 35 % and the gain in market share of the low-priced dumped imports was as high as 8,6 percentage points. This meant that the Community industry did not fully participate in the growth of the market over the period considered.\n4.5.4. Profitability, Return on Investments and Cash Flow\n(74)\nProfitability on EC sales represents the profit generated by sales of farmed salmon on the Community market. Return on Total Assets and Cash Flow could only be measured at the level of the narrowest group of products which included the like product, pursuant to Article 3(8) of the basic Regulation. In this context it should be noted that farmed salmon represented over 95 % of the economic activity of the sampled Community industry.\n(75)\nMoreover, the Return on investments has been calculated on the basis of Return on total assets since the companies constituting the Community industry are mainly, if not exclusively, active in the production and sales of the product concerned. For the purpose of this investigation, the return on investments is expressed as the profit in percent of the net book value of investments.\nTable 7\nProfitability, Return on Investments and Cash Flow\n2001\n2002\n2003\nIP\nProfitability on EC Sales\n7,2 %\n- 2,9 %\n- 6,2 %\n- 4,0 %\nReturn on Investment\n36,7 %\n- 15,5 %\n- 20,7 %\n- 21,4 %\nCash Flow (000 EUR)\n3 331\n- 11\n951\n698\nSource: Sampled Community industry.\n(76)\nDuring the year 2001, the Community industry was profitable at 7,2 %. Between 2001 and 2002 the profitability turned negative with a decrease of 10,1 percentage points. Since this point of time the Community industry remained loss making. It should be noted that the situation deteriorated even more between 2002 and 2003 with a loss of 6,2 % (or 3,3 percentage points). The sustained demand for salmon during the IP allowed the Community industry to slightly increase its sales prices and reduce its loss, which however remained significant (- 4 %). From the beginning to the end of the period considered the decrease in profitability was as high as 11,2 percentage points.\n(77)\nDuring the period considered the return on investments and cash flow followed a trend similar to that of profitability.\n4.5.5. Investments and ability to raise capital\nTable 8 Investments and ability to raise capital\n2001\n2002\n2003\nIP\nInvestments (000 EUR)\n1 407\n1 301\n1 101\n2 249\nSource: Sampled Community industry.\n(78)\nInvestments made by the Community increased during the period considered. They first decreased in 2002 and 2003, before increasing in the IP. To a certain extent, these investments can be explained by the sustained demand which has characterized the period considered. It was also found that a considerable part of the investments were made to maintain the existing production tools or to replace equipments at the end of their life cycle. Furthermore, the Community industry has been making considerable efforts to improve its competitiveness on this market in recent years. Steps to improve their efficiency and reduce costs in the face of increased competition have been taken by entering into joint arrangements for feed buying for example, or engaging into joint marketing and sales. Finally, the Community industry has also been under a process of consolidation. There have been significant changes in the structure of the salmon farming industry in the Community with a trend towards fewer companies. A number of smaller producers have either gone out of business or sold out to other producers, which invested in these companies.\n(79)\nDuring the period considered, it was found that the Community industry started to have more difficulties in raising capital. The Community industry’s ability to raise capital should also be seen in the light of the evolution of the cash flow of the Community industry which was negative during the IP. It is also clear that the losses accumulated by the Community industry and the level of sales prices during the period considered played a negative role when looking for outside sources of financing.\n4.5.6. Employment and Productivity\nTable 9 Employment and Productivity\n2001\n2002\n2003\nIP\nNumber of employees\n254\n272\n269\n265\nIndex\n100\n107\n106\n104\nProductivity (tonne/employee)\n71,3\n75,8\n72,1\n77,5\nIndex\n100\n106\n101\n108\nSource: Community industry.\n(80)\nBetween 2001 and the IP employment by the Community industry (overall) increased by 4 %. This increase took place, however, between 2001 and 2002 (+ 7 %) and can be explained by the increase in production realised during the period considered. As the above table shows, the increase in employment which occurred in 2002 could not be maintained because of the market situation and was followed by a decrease in 2003 and the IP.\n(81)\nAlthough employment increased slightly, the Community industry was able to increase its productivity during the period considered. Given the level of production and the level of personnel employed, productivity increased by 8 % during the period considered.\n4.5.7. Wages\nTable 10 Wages\n2001\n2002\n2003\nIP\nWages (000 EUR)\n4 620\n4 223\n4 015\n3 765\nIndex\n100\n91\n87\n81\nSource: Sampled Community industry.\n(82)\nWages had to be decreased by 19 % during the period considered.\n4.5.8. Recovery from past dumping\n(83)\nIt should be noted that between September 1997 and May 2003 a significant proportion of imports of farmed salmon originating in Norway has been subject to price undertakings in the context of the then existing anti-dumping and anti-subsidy measures. While the Community industry was profitable in 2001, in the course of 2002, violations of these price undertakings by certain Norwegian exporting producers began to undermine the effectiveness of that instrument and caused price falls. The current investigation shows that prices of the exporting producers in Norway have decreased by 16 % as from 2001. The major price decreases occurred as from 2002, when the violations of the undertakings then in force began to increase. Under these circumstances, it is considered that recovery from past dumping has not been possible.\n4.5.9. Magnitude of the actual margin of dumping\n(84)\nThe impact on the Community industry of the magnitude of the actual margin of dumping, which is also significant, cannot be considered to be negligible given the volume and the prices of the imports concerned.\n4.6. Conclusion on injury\n(85)\nThe investigation shows that between 2001 and the IP imports of the product concerned have taken place continuously in increased quantities and high volumes onto the Community market (+ 35 %), especially between 2002 and 2003. During the same period the average prices of dumped imports have decreased continuously by 16 %, plummeting downwards between 2002 and 2003 and since then staying at a very low level. It was found that Norwegian market share increased by 17 % or 8,6 percentage points during the period considered.\n(86)\nAs to the situation of the Community industry, an examination of the above indicators shows that between 2001 and the IP, it gradually deteriorated. While some factors showed a positive trend during the period considered (production, production capacity, sales volumes), most indicators developed negatively (sales prices, market share, profitability, cash flow, return on investment, wages).\n(87)\nAs regards the positive development of production and sales volumes, it was found that these increases only allowed the Community industry to regain lost market shares during the IP and to maintain the regained market share. Production capacity was considered to be of limited relevance as capacity figures are theoretical based on the total quantity licensed rather than the physical fish-holding capacity. In consequence, capacity utilisation decreased from 49 % to 47 % in this period, whereas productivity increased mostly due to greater use of automation (+ 8 %). During the period considered the Community market was characterized by a sustained demand as consumption grew by 15 % or by 80 000 tonnes. Although the Community industry managed to increase its production and sales volumes by both 13 %, it just managed to maintain its market share. In the same time Norwegian exporters managed to increase their sales by 93 000 tonnes and gained considerable market share.\n(88)\nMoreover, the increase in sales volume by the Community industry occurred at the expense of falling prices. This has led to a fall in profitability from a positive into a negative, loss making situation (7,2 % in 2001 to losses of - 2,9 %, - 6,2 % and - 4,0 % in 2002, 2003 and the IP respectively). Return on investments and Cash Flow followed a trend similar to that of profitability. Also wages have suffered during the period considered (- 19 %).\n(89)\nTaking account of all of these factors, the provisional conclusion reached is that the Community industry has suffered material injury within the meaning of Article 3 of the basic Regulation.\n5. CAUSATION\n5.1. Preliminary remarks\n(90)\nIn order to reach its provisional conclusion as to whether there is a causal link between the dumped imports and the injury suffered by the Community industry, the Commission first examined in accordance with Article 3(6) of the basic Regulation, the impact of the dumped imports from the country concerned on the situation in that industry.\n(91)\nSecondly, in accordance with Article 3(7) of the basic Regulation, the Commission also examined other factors which might have injured the Community industry in order to ensure that any injury caused by those factors was not wrongly attributed to the dumped imports. Known factors other than dumped imports which could at the same time be injuring the Community industry, were also analysed in order to ensure that possible injury caused by other factors was not attributed to the dumped imports.\n5.2. Effect of the dumped imports from the country concerned\n(92)\nThe link between the injury suffered by the Community industry and the dumped imports is demonstrated in particular by the following coinciding developments: from 2001 until the end of the IP the volume of imports of Norwegian farmed salmon into the Community increased by 35 % and their market share rose to 59,6 %, meaning a gain of 8,6 percentage points at the expense of the Community industry. Norwegian prices decreased by 16 % within the period considered.\n(93)\nThis development of Norwegian imports coincided with large financial losses of the Community producers. Indeed, the developments of the imports from Norway coincided with the significant declining trend of the main economic indicators pertaining to the Community industry from 2001 to the end of the IP. Between 2002 and the IP, when prices from Norway decreased by around 13 % sales prices decreased by 5 % and the loss of market share of the Community industry was as high as 3 %. As a result, the Community industry incurred losses during the IP and in the two years preceding the IP. As it is generally accepted that imports from Norway, particularly due to their large volumes, are the price leader in the Community market for farmed salmon, this situation shows that the Community industry was subject to strong price pressure exacerbated by dumped imports on the Community market. The effect of the price pressure is further evidenced by the price undercutting practised by the Norwegian exporting producers and the prices of the Community industry, which were depressed to a considerable extent during the IP.\n5.3. Effect of other factors\n5.3.1. Effect of imports originating in other third countries\n(94)\nThe imports from third countries not concerned by this investigation showed the following development during the period considered:\nTable 11\nImports originating in other third countries\n2001\n2002\n2003\nIP\nTotal other third countries than Norway (Tonnes)\n82 082\n106 154\n108 157\n117 994\nIndex\n100\n129\n132\n144\nMarket share\n15,5 %\n19,3 %\n17,7 %\n19,4 %\nAverage price (EUR per kg)\n2,86\n2,34\n2,15\n2,23\nUSA (Tonnes)\n5 011\n26 359\n27 233\n24 624\nIndex\n100\n526\n543\n491\nMarket share\n0,9 %\n4,8 %\n4,5 %\n4,0 %\nAverage price (EUR per kg)\n2,35\n1,73\n1,57\n1,69\nCanada (Tonnes)\n593\n3 592\n6 490\n6 940\nIndex\n100\n605\n1094\n1170\nMarket share\n0,1 %\n0,7 %\n1,1 %\n1,1 %\nAverage price (EUR per kg)\n2,90\n1,89\n1,72\n1,77\nChile (Tonnes)\n26 442\n28 669\n19 455\n24 547\nIndex\n100\n108\n74\n93\nMarket share\n5,0 %\n5,2 %\n3,2 %\n4,0 %\nAverage price (EUR per kg)\n2,93\n2,36\n2,60\n2,89\nFaeroe Islands (Tonnes)\n40 505\n37 075\n41 202\n37 108\nIndex\n100\n92\n102\n92\nMarket share\n7,7 %\n6,7 %\n6,7 %\n6,1 %\nAverage price (EUR per kg)\n2,95\n2,78\n2,50\n2,57\nSource: Eurostat.\n(95)\nThe table above shows the imports volumes, market shares and average price of imported farmed salmon from all countries other than Norway and also individually for the traditional importers, i.e. USA, Canada, Chile and the Faeroe Islands.\n(96)\nIt should be noted that the import statistics do not distinguish between farmed salmon and wild salmon. However, on the basis of information gathered during the investigation, it appears that the vast part of imports from USA and Canada consists most of wild salmon, so that it is unlikely that imports from these two countries could have a significant impact on the situation of the Community industry.\n(97)\nThe above table also shows that import prices from Chile were above the level of those of the Community industry during the IP and that farmed salmon prices varied significantly among other third countries. Import prices from the Faeroe Islands were lower than those charged by the Norwegian exporting producers but it must be noted that the import volumes from Chile and Faeroe Islands have decreased by 7 % and 8 % respectively during the period considered.\n(98)\nThese developments should be seen in the light of the development of consumption and the dumped imports from Norway. As shown in recital 51 above, consumption increased by 15 % during the period considered and consumption in the IP remained nearly on the same level as in 2003, with a slight decrease of 0,5 %. As explained in recital 55 above, the imports from Norway increased by around 35 % during the period considered and the increase between 2003 and the IP was around 3,1 %.\n(99)\nGiven the above, it is therefore provisionally concluded that imports into the Community from other third countries could not be a determining reason for the material injury suffered by the Community industry.\n5.3.2. Effect of changes in the pattern of consumption\n(100)\nThe consumption of farmed salmon in the Community increased by 15 % during the period considered to reach a level of almost 608 000 tonnes in the IP. The Community industry benefited from this growth in consumption to increase its production and sales volume. The development of consumption is therefore not considered to have contributed to the injury suffered by the Community industry.\n(101)\nIt has been argued that there had been an alleged fall in consumption in the United Kingdom and that this had caused injury to the Community producers. However, the United Kingdom market cannot be isolated from the overall Community market and the increased consumption found for the Community market during the period considered. A reduction in demand for farmed salmon within a certain part of the Community, while total demand is increasing, cannot be seen as the cause of the deteriorated economic situation of the Community industry. Therefore, it was provisionally found that changes in the pattern of consumption did not contribute to the material injury suffered by the Community industry.\n5.3.3. Effect of changes in export performance of the Community industry\nTable 12 Export volumes of the Community industry\n2001\n2002\n2003\nIP\nExports (tonnes)\n169\n211\n348\n423\nSource: Community industry.\n(102)\nThe effect of variations in the level of exports of the Community industry has also been examined. Exports increased by 150 %. In the light of the difficult situation on the Community market, the Community industry sought to increase their exports, which nevertheless did not rise to more than around 2 % of their overall production and sales. It is therefore provisionally concluded that any changes in the level of exports were not a cause of the material injury suffered by the Community industry. In any event, it is noted that data relating to profitability is based on data relating to Community sales to unrelated Community customers only.\n5.3.4. Other producers in the Community related to Norwegian producers/importers\n(103)\nIt has been examined whether injury to the Community industry has been caused by other producers in the EC related to Norwegian producers. As mentioned in recital 44 these companies were not included in the definition of Community industry on the basis of Article 4(1) of the basic Regulation.\n(104)\nFive producers in the Community related to Norwegian producers/importers submitted a meaningful reply to the questionnaire. These producers represented approximately 54 % of other producers in the Community related to Norwegian producers/importers.\nTable 13\nSales volume, market share and average sales prices to unrelated customers of producers in the EC related to Norwegian producers/importers\n2001\n2002\n2003\nIP\nSales to unrelated customers in the EC (Tonnes)\n67 983\n71 879\n76 175\n72 255\nIndex\n100\n105\n112\n106\nMarket share\n12,8 %\n13,0 %\n12,4 %\n11,9 %\nAverage price (EUR per kg)\n2,90\n2,84\n2,73\n2,76\nSource: Questionnaire replies of producers in the EC related to Norwegian producers/importers.\n(105)\nThe above table shows that on the basis of the questionnaire replies, sales volumes of the five cooperating companies have increased during the period considered by 6 %, and that the decrease of their prices was around 5 %, generally in line with the developments of the Community industry. Moreover, it was also found that their market share decreased by around 1 percentage point during the period considered, which is also in line with the development for the Community industry, and that their sales prices were above the level of those of Norwegian exporting producers (around 5 % during the IP). In the same period of time Norwegian exporters managed to increase their sales by 93 000 tonnes and gained market share. However, it appears that the detriment of the economic situation of the producers in the EC related to Norwegian producers/importers may not have been as pronounced as the economic situation of the Community industry.\n(106)\nIt is therefore provisionally considered that the producers in the EC related to Norwegian producers/importers did not in any significant way contribute to the material injury suffered by the Community industry.\n5.3.5. Effect of increased mortality on production and sales volumes\n(107)\nOne interested party argued that higher than normal fish mortality rates in Ireland and disease outbreaks in the United Kingdom and Ireland in 2002 and 2003 could have caused a significant loss of production and sales volumes. However, it was found that these phenomena were limited to a small number of farms and could not have an appreciable effect on overall figures. As shown at recitals 64 and 69, production and sales volume of the Community industry increased during the period considered. Therefore, it is provisionally concluded that higher than normal fish mortality rates were not the cause of material injurious effects.\n5.3.6. Effect of smaller less efficient producers in the EC and higher cost of production\n(108)\nIt was argued that the Norwegian industry has lower production costs than the Community producers and that this, and a failure by the Community producers to reduce production costs, is a reason for increased imports and serious injury. On the basis of the information available, it was found that whilst Norway enjoys advantages in relation to certain costs (e.g. medicines, feed, environmental regulatory cost), the Community producers enjoy advantages in relation to others (e.g. labour). Overall, it is noted that whilst the Community producers are incurring significant losses in the current market, so too are Norwegian producers, as evidenced inter alia by Norwegian government data and the dumping investigation. It was therefore provisionally found that the argument that Community producers were less efficient than the Norwegian exporters was not substantiated and that this could not be a cause of the injurious situation of the Community industry.\n5.3.7. Effect of regulatory constraints in the UK\n(109)\nAn interested party argued that regulatory constraints in the UK relating to environmental controls and fish health standard, biomass consent, medication approval system and approval of locations is a reason for reducing the competitiveness of the Community industry and a reason for the serious injury suffered by the Community industry. No evidence was however produced in support of these arguments, nor were the arguments developed, nor did the verification of UK companies point to any indications in this respect. In these circumstances, these factors cannot be taken as relevant causation factors for the serious injury to the Community producers. On the contrary, it can be argued, that stricter environmental and sanitary legislation in the Community increases the attractiveness of a product in view of modern consumers.\n5.4. Conclusion of Causation\n(110)\nOn the basis of the above, it is provisionally concluded that there is a causal link between the dumped imports and the material injury suffered by the Community industry. This conclusion is based on the fact that there were significant increases in volumes and market shares of dumped imports, which also undercut considerably the prices of the Community industry, from Norway. Moreover, there is a striking coincidence in time between the sharp rise of dumped imports made at decreasing prices and the deterioration of the financial situation of the Community industry leading to the loss making situation of the Community industry.\n(111)\nNo other factors have been found which could have affected in a significant way the situation of the Community industry. It is also provisionally concluded that imports into the Community from other third countries could not be a determining reason for the material injury suffered by the Community industry.\n6. COMMUNITY INTEREST\n6.1. General considerations\n(112)\nIn accordance with Article 21(1) of the basic Regulation it has been examined whether, despite the conclusion on injurious dumping, compelling reasons existed that could lead to the conclusion that it would not be in the Community interest to introduce anti-dumping measures against imports from the country concerned. The determination of Community interest was based on an appreciation of all the various interests involved, i.e. those of the Community industry, the importers/traders/processors/users as well as the consumers of the product concerned. The Commission sent questionnaires in particular to the Community industry, producers in the EC related to Norwegian producers/importers, importers, processors, users, suppliers of the product concerned and a consumer organisation.\n6.2. Interest of the Community industry\n(113)\nThe Community industry has been suffering from low priced imports of farmed salmon from Norway. The objective of the eventual adoption of anti-dumping measures is to re-establish fair competition on the Community market between the Community industry and their exporting counterparts in Norway. In view of the nature of the injury suffered by the Community industry, it is considered that, in the absence of measures, a further deterioration in the situation of the Community industry is unavoidable. Not adopting measures will most likely entail further injury and in the medium term, potentially the disappearance of that industry, bearing in mind the losses occurred during the period considered. Therefore, on the basis of the findings in the IP, the Community industry position is in jeopardy unless the current level of low dumped import prices is corrected. This is evidenced by continuing reports of impending bankruptcies.\n(114)\nThe Community industry has been making considerable efforts to improve its competitiveness on this market in recent years. The main areas for the production of salmon in the Community are located in Scotland and Ireland where suitable conditions exist. There have been significant changes in the structure of the salmon farming industry in the Community during the last years with a trend towards fewer, larger companies. A number of smaller producers have either gone out of business or sold out to other companies in the Community, which invested in these production sites. Many of the companies constituting the Community industry have taken steps to improve their efficiency and reduce costs in the face of increased competition e.g. by raising smolts, improving feeding equipment and by entering into joint arrangements for feed buying. This has enabled the companies to increase their buying power vis-à-vis suppliers. At the same time, a number of the companies constituting the Community industry have also entered into arrangements for the joint marketing and sale of their production. This will strengthen their position in the market.\n(115)\nIf however anti-dumping measures are taken, these would reinstate fair trading conditions and warrant the efforts made by the Community industry in the last years. Under these conditions the Community industry will be able to remain a viable producer of farmed salmon. The main effect of measures will be that the below cost selling of the Community industry will cease. However, given the other sources of supply, the Community industry has only a very limited possibility to increase prices. They could mainly redress their situation by increased sales volumes and consequently increased economies of scale. Moreover, the investor confidence to the business will return and the market will become stable.\n(116)\nAccordingly, it is provisionally concluded that the adoption of anti-dumping measures would be in the interest of the Community industry.\n6.3. Interests of producers of smolt and feed\n(117)\nIt is also in the interests of the major suppliers to the Community producers (such as smolt and feed producers) to have a strong and predictable demand for their product at a fair price which allows them to make a reasonable profit. If the Community industry’s situation does not improve, many of the smolt producers will have to reduce their sales and profitability and in some cases may be threatened in their ability to continue trading. The same applies to feed producers. Therefore, it is in the interests of the smolt producers and feed producers for anti-dumping measures to be taken.\n6.4. Interest of producers in the EC related to Norwegian producers/importers\n(118)\nIn order to evaluate the impact of measures on producers in the EC related to Norwegian producers/importers, questionnaires were sent to the known companies of the product concerned on the Community market. Five companies submitted meaningful replies.\n(119)\nThese companies employed nearly 738 people in salmon related activities in the IP and had a combined turnover in excess of around EUR 250 million. These producers did either not express their view or were against the imposition of measures.\n(120)\nAs shown in recital 104, these companies also suffer from the price depression caused by the Norwegian exporting producers. It is recalled, that the cooperating producers related to Norwegian exporters/importers increased their sales volumes by 6 % or by around 4 200 tonnes but they still lost market share. In the same time, Norwegian exporters managed to increase their sales by 93 000 tonnes and gained market share. Therefore, it is considered that the imposition of anti-dumping measures will also improve the economic situation of the producers in the EC related to Norwegian producers/importers.\n(121)\nAnti-dumping measures which reinstall fair trading conditions are therefore also in the interest of these producers.\n6.5. Interest of unrelated importers and processors (users)\n(122)\nIn order to evaluate the impact on importers and processors of taking or not taking measures, questionnaires were sent to the known importers and processors of the product concerned on the Community market. The Commission also informed various organisations of importers, processors and users of the opening of the investigation. Several organizations made their views know.\n(123)\nIt was found that importers and processors (users) are normally one and the same and many are in fact related to exporting producers outside the Community, particularly in Norway. Meaningful responses were received from 8 importers/processors/users. These companies represented around 9 % of total imports from Norway during the IP and roughly 6 % of consumption. Thus, their data give some indication, although it is by far not certain that they are fully representative for the whole user industry.\n(124)\nImporters and processors stressed that any increase in prices would increase their cost base, reduce their sales and profitability and may lead to job losses and even de-localisation. They also argued that employment in the fish processing sector is far higher than in the fish farming industry and in some cases provides employment in areas of low employment.\n(125)\nIn this respect it was found that importers and processors may have to pay higher prices if they continue to buy Norwegian merchandise, because they would have to pay an anti-dumping duty. However, they do not have to bear all price increases because it is likely that they can pass on the increase to some degree to the subsequent steps in the distribution chain and consumers.\n(126)\nThe main costs incurred by processors are the costs of the raw material and employment costs. It is true that an increase in raw material prices would increase the costs for processing. On the basis of the three most meaningful replies it was found that farmed salmon represents around 54 % of the total cost of production. These processors bought farmed salmon during the IP both in the Community (around 15 % of their purchases) and from Norway (around 83 % of their purchases). Therefore it is concluded that around 45 % of their total cost will be exposed to a duty. In this context it should also be noted that, according to the information provided by importers and processors, the costs of their raw material fell by 14 % during the period considered. During the IP, it was 9,1 percentage points cheaper than in 2001. At the same time, the information provided by them indicates that their selling prices have remained about the same in 2002 and 2003, with decreasing trend towards the IP. However, due to the low level of cooperation of users in this respect, the empirical basis is rather limited and one should be cautious in drawing conclusions for the user industry as a whole. It is also noted that only two companies reported on profitability.\n(127)\nAs to employment, according to the replies received to the questionnaires, around 3 400 workers were employed in the fish processing sector in the Community although only a small proportion of those are concerned in processing farmed salmon. No evidence was found that the possible measures would lead to a decrease in the level of employment in the Community.\n(128)\nTherefore, the disadvantages likely to be suffered by importers/processors/users, if any, are not considered such as to outweigh the benefits expected to accrue to the Community producers as a consequence of the anti-dumping measures, which are considered the minimum necessary to remedy the serious injury suffered and prevent further serious deterioration in the situation of the Community producers. In addition, it should be noted that other sources of supply from other third countries also remain available.\n6.6. Interest of consumers\n(129)\nAs the product concerned is a consumer product, the Commission informed various consumer organisations of the opening of an investigation. A response was received from one party to the effect that the beneficial effects of salmon are widely recognised and that artificially increasing the price would make good nutrition choices more difficult for consumers and damage the economic viability of importers, processors and retailers of farmed salmon. It was also claimed that the measures may prevent them from importing and continuing to sell frozen farmed salmon. Concern was also expressed that any increase in prices would make farmed salmon less affordable and stifle market growth in those Member States with a lower than average gross domestic product per head (GDP).\n(130)\nIt is considered that if anti-dumping measures are imposed, economic operators will continue to have access to unlimited quantities of imports, albeit at fair prices. Further, given the magnitude of the margins between the whole fish ex-farm and the retail price of processed salmon products, it is considered that the measures are unlikely to have a material effect on retail prices, since it is unlikely that the whole price increase will be passed on to consumers. The impact on consumers is therefore considered to be minimal. In addition, loss-making price levels are probably not sustainable in the medium to long term. The interest of consumers appears therefore overall to be best served by stable prices and a sustainable market.\n6.7. Conclusion on Community Interest\n(131)\nOn the basis of the above facts and considerations it is provisionally concluded, that there are no compelling reasons not to impose anti-dumping duties.\n7. PROVISIONAL ANTI-DUMPING MEASURES\n7.1. Injury elimination level\n(132)\nIn view of the provisional conclusions reached with regard to dumping, injury, causation and Community interest, provisional measures should be imposed in order to prevent further injury being caused to the Community industry by the dumped imports.\n(133)\nFor the purpose of establishing the level of the provisional measures, account has been taken of both the dumping margin found and the amount of duty necessary to eliminate the injury sustained by the Community industry.\n(134)\nThe provisional measures should be imposed at a level sufficient to eliminate the injury caused by these imports without exceeding the dumping margin found. When calculating the amount of duty necessary to remove the effects of the injurious dumping, it was considered that any measures should allow the Community industry to cover its costs of production and obtain overall a profit before tax that could be reasonably achieved by an industry of this type in the sector under normal conditions of competition, i.e. in the absence of dumped imports, on the sales of the like product in the Community. On this basis a non-injurious price was calculated for the Community industry of the like product. The non-injurious price has been obtained provisionally by adding a profit margin of 7,2 % on turnover to the cost of production. This profit margin was provisionally established on the basis of the profit achieved during the year 2001 and is a strict minimum which the Community industry could expect to obtain in the absence of injurious dumping. This issue will be further investigated after the imposition of provisional measures and after receipt of any subsequent comments by interested parties.\n(135)\nThe necessary price increase was then determined on the basis of a comparison of the weighted average import price, as established for the undercutting calculations, with the average non-injurious price of products sold by the Community industry on the Community market. Any difference resulting from this comparison was then expressed as a percentage of the average import CIF value.\n7.2. Provisional measures\n(136)\nIn the light of the foregoing, it is considered that a provisional anti-dumping duty should be imposed at the level of the dumping margin found, but should not, in accordance with Article 7(2) of the basic Regulation, be higher than the injury margin calculated above.\n(137)\nThe individual company anti-dumping duty rates specified in this document were established on the basis of the findings of the present investigation. Therefore, they reflect the situation found during that investigation with respect to these companies. These duty rates (as opposed to the countrywide duty applicable to ‘all other companies’) are thus exclusively applicable to imports of products originating in the country concerned and produced by the companies and thus by the specific legal entities mentioned. Imported products produced by any other company not specifically mentioned in the operative part of this document with its name and address, including entities related to those specifically mentioned, cannot benefit from these rates and shall be subject to the duty rate applicable to ‘all other companies’.\n(138)\nAny claim requesting the application of these individual company anti-dumping duty rates (e.g. following a change in the name of the entity or following the setting up of new production or sales entities) should be addressed to the Commission (8) forthwith with all relevant information, in particular any modification in the company's activities linked to production, domestic and export sales associated with, for example, that name change or that change in the production and sales entities. The Commission, if appropriate, will, after consultation of the Advisory Committee, amend the Regulation accordingly by updating the list of companies benefiting from individual duty rates.\n(139)\nOn the basis of the above, the provisional duty rates are:\nCompany\nDumping Margin\nInjury Margin\nAnti-Dumping duty\nMarine Harvest Norway AS,\n21,9 %\n15,3 %\n15,3 %\nFjord Seafood Norway AS\n37,7 %\n13,5 %\n13,5 %\nPan Fish Norway AS\n25,4 %\n16,1 %\n16,1 %\nStolt Sea Farm AS\n13,9 %\n14,2 %\n13,9 %\nFollalaks AS\n24,5 %\n27,7 %\n24,5 %\nNordlaks Oppdrett AS\n6,8 %\n14,6 %\n6,8 %\nHydrotech AS\n21,9 %\n15,3 %\n15,3 %\nGrieg Seafood AS\n22,9 %\n17,2 %\n17,2 %\nWeighted Average\n22,5 %\n16,0 %\n16,0 %\nResidual Margin\n37,7 %\n27,7 %\n24,5 %\n7.3. Final Provision\n(140)\nIn the interest of sound administration, a period should be fixed within which the interested parties which made themselves known within the time limit specified in the notice of initiation may make their views known in writing and request a hearing. Furthermore, it should be stated that the findings concerning the imposition of duties made for the purposes of this Regulation are provisional and may have to be reconsidered for the purpose of any definitive duty,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\n1.

This Directive is a specific Directive within the meaning of Article 3 of Directive 76/893/EEC.\n2. This Directive shall apply to plastic materials and articles, that is to say to materials and articles and parts thereof:\n(a) consisting exclusively of plastics, or\n(b) composed of two or more layers of materials, each consisting exclusively of plastics, which are bound together by means of adhesives or by any other means,\nwhich, in the finished product state, are intended to come into contact or are brought into contact with foodstuffs and are intended for that purpose.\n3. For the purposes of this Directive, 'plastics' shall mean the organic macromolecular compounds obtained by polymerization, polycondensation, polyaddition or any other similar process from molecules with a lower molecular weight or by chemical alteration of natural macromolecules. Silicones and other similar macromolecular compounds shall also be regarded as plastics. Other substances or matter may be added to such macromolecular compounds.\nHowever, the following shall not be regarded as 'plastics':\n(i) varnished or unvarnished regenerated cellulose film;\n(ii) elastomers and natural and synthetic rubber;\n(iii) paper and paperboard, whether modified or not by the addition of plastics;\n(iv) surface coatings obtained from:\n- paraffin waxes, including synthetic paraffin waxes, and/or micro-crystalline waxes,\n- mixtures of the waxes listed in the first indent with each other and/or with plastics.\n4. This Directive shall not apply to materials and articles composed or two or more layers, one or more of which does not consist exclusively of plastics, even if the one intended to come into direct contact with foodstuffs does consist exclusively of plastics.\nA decision on the application of this Directive to the materials and articles referred to in the first subparagraph and on any adaptations to the Directive that may become necessary shall be taken at a later date.\nArticle 2\n1. The migration level of the constituents of the materials and articles referred to in Article 1 into or onto foodstuffs must not exceed the limits laid down in the lists of substances whose use is authorized to the exclusion of any others.\n2. In the absence of methods of analysis determined in accordance with Article 9 of Directive 76/893/EEC which make it possible to determine the level of migration into foodstuffs, that level shall be determined in the simulants listed in Chapter I of the Annex.\n3. The Council, acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 100 of the Treaty and on a proposal from the Commission, shall draw up a list of substances or matter whose use is authorized to the exclusion of any others and a list of simulants to be used for each foodstuff or group of foodstuffs and shall determine the concentration thereof.\nArticle 3\n1. Verification of a migration in the simulants shall be carried out using conventional migration tests, the basic rules for which are laid down in the Annex to this Directive.\n2. (a) However, where a Member State, as a result of new information or of a reassessment of existing information made since this Directive was adopted, has detailed grounds for establishing that for a given plastic material or article the basic rules laid down in the Annex for migration tests are technically unsuitable or because the actual conditions of use are basically different from the test conditions specified in the table in the Annex, that Member State may,\nwithin its territory and only for the particular case, temporarily suspend application of the basic rules referred to in the Annex and permit the use of more appropriate basic rules. It shall immediately inform the other Member States and the Commission thereof and give the reasons for its decision.\n(b) The Commission shall examine, as soon as possible, the reasons given by the Member State concerned and shall consult the Member States within the Standing Committee for Foodstuffs and shall then deliver its opinion forthwith and take the appropriate measures.\n(c) If the Commission considers that amendments to this Directive are necessary in order to alleviate the difficulties mentioned in subparagraph (a), it shall initiate the procedure laid down in Article 10 of Directive 76/893/EEC; in that case, the Member State which has adopted the more appropriate basic rules may retain them until the said amendments enter into force.\nArticle 4\nAdaptations to be made to Chapter II of the Annex to this Directive in the light of progress in scientific and technical knowledge shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 10 of Directive 76/893/EEC.\nArticle 5\nThis Directive shall not affect national provisions relating to the other rules provided for in Article 3 of Directive 76/893/EEC nor the options open to Member States under Article 7 (4) and (5) of that Directive.\nArticle 6\nMember States shall comply with this Directive not later than such time as a specific directive laying down the limits referred to in Article 2 (1) is implemented.\nArticle 7\nThis Directive is addressed to the Member States.\nDone at Luxembourg, 18 October 1982.",

PROCEDURE\nOn 15 April 1997 the Commission wrote to the German Government, informing it that on 12 March it had decided to initiate proceedings under Article 93(2) of the EC Treaty. The proceedings related to DEM 765 million which InfraLeuna Infrastruktur und Service GmbH (hereinafter referred to as \"InfraLeuna\") was to receive from the Bundesanstalt für Vereinigungsbedingte Sonderaufgaben (hereinafter \"the BvS\"), and DEM 300 million which was to be provided by the Land of Saxony-Anhalt; the Commission was concerned that the money might constitute state aid and, if so, that it might not be compatible with the common market.\nThe Commission's decision to initiate proceedings was announced in the Official Journal of the European Communities; the notice called on Member States and interested parties to submit observations(1). The German Government submitted its observations on the decision in a letter of 14 August 1997.\nThe Commission had received observations opening the proceedings, from one Member State, three trade associations and four companies; it passed these on to the German Government by letter of 28 August. The German Government replied by letter of 17 November.\nIn letters dated 14 May 1997, 1 December 1997 and 18 March 1998, the Commission put a number of questions to the German Government that had arisen in connection with the case. The German Government replied in its letter of 14 August 1997 and in further letters on 9 January and 10 July 1998. In order to clarify the case further, meetings between the German authorities and the Commission took place in Leuna on 7 and 8 July 1997 and in Brussels on 30 April and 28 July 1998.\nII. FACTS\nOn the basis of the letters cited here and the information supplied by the German Government at the meetings just referred to, the facts of the matter can be stated as follows.\n1. Background\nThe case concerns the privatisation of the infrastructure at the Leuna chemical complex in Saxony-Anhalt, a region which qualifies for assistance under Article 92(3)(a) of the EC Treaty(2).\nChemicals was one of the main industries in the former German Democratic Republic, using a workforce of about 90000. It was based in Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt, forming what is known as the \"chemical triangle\". Production was concentrated in a few very large state-owned enterprises, which were interlinked and dependent on one another for supplies of raw materials, intermediate products, energy and so on. The chemicals industry in Leuna was an important component in the chemical triangle, employing 26000 people.\nAfter the unification of Germany in 1990, the Treuhandanstalt privatisation agency (hereinafter: \"the Treuhand\") sought to privatise the chemicals industry. The first step was to create economic units of a size that might interest a potential buyer. In 1990, the Treuhand set up Leuna Werke AG on the Leuna site, as the immediate successor to the old state enterprise (\"Volkseigener Betrieb\"). At the beginning of 1994, the form of the company was changed, with Leuna Werke AG becoming Leuna-Werke GmbH (hereinafter \"LWG\"); and in June 1994 a new company was hived off under the name Leuna-Werke Standortservice GmbH (hereinafter \"LWS\"), whose object was to provide, on site, the infrastructure and supply the services necessary for the manufacturing operations. These included roads, pipe bridges, fire-fighting services, waste dump, fresh water supply, waste-water collection, laboratory services, communications, and energy, gas and water supplies.\n2. The Treuhand's efforts at privatisation\nThe Treuhand initially planned to sell the entire Leuna site with the existing infrastructure as a single enterprise, and in 1991 and 1992 Leuna Werke AG was offered for sale, in an international, open, transparent and unconditional tendering procedure. However, no investor was found who was prepared to take over a chemicals operation on this scale. In addition, the plant was in a dilapidated condition, so that a buyer would have had to undertake substantial investment and extensive anti-pollution measures.\nThe Treuhand then changed its approach, and decided to split up the product lines and privatise them separately. The separate units were offered for sale in open, transparent and unconditional procedures; by the end of 1994 there had been 97 privatisations. The various chemical product lines were sold to a range of investors including UCB, Rhone Poulenc and Dow. The biggest chemical investors on the site were Linde AG, which took over the production of industrial gases, and Caproleuna, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Domo Group, [...](3), which took over the production of Caprolactam.\nMost of the product lines were sold and the volume of production grew substantially; the site infrastructure, however, remained in the hands of the Treuhand, which in turn assigned it to its subsidiary, LWS.\nFor the continued operation of the infrastructure, there were roughly two alternatives: either it could be run by the public sector (in the shape of the Land, the local authority, or a public utility); or a private buyer could be found. In 1992, in order to evaluate the needs of the site and to identify the best solution, the Treuhand commissioned studies of the site from internationally recognised consultants. At the same time it made repeated attempts to persuade the Land of Saxony-Anhalt and the municipality of Leuna to take over the infrastructure. The negotiations were ultimately broken off when it became clear that neither the Land nor the municipality was prepared to take on the operation of the facilities.\nConsequently, the only options left were for the infrastructure to be sold to a private investor or for the Treuhand itself to go on operating it. The Treuhand had to bear in mind that the earlier calls for tenders had shown that investors generally had no interest in taking over the infrastructure and that the number of enterprises qualified to run it was small, given the size of the site and the specialised manufacturing going on there. It was not clear, either, whether as regards the site it would make more sense to sell the entire infrastructure to a single investor or to separate the different parts and sell them off to different investors.\nIn 1992, therefore, the Treuhand began making direct approaches to companies that possessed the necessary technical know-how and specific knowledge of the chemicals industry. Companies that were important in the industry, and especially companies already operating there, were taken to visit the site; LWS allowed interested parties full freedom to inspect its books, under agreements known as \"due diligence\"(4) agreements(5), and gave them copies of the consultants' studies. In this way, the Treuhand hoped to stimulate interest in the site among companies and to involve them in the search for a workable solution.\nBetween the end of 1992 and the end of 1994, the Treuhand negotiated with three serious candidates for the sale of the entire infrastructure: with a consortium consisting of Thyssen, VEW and Steag; with Mannesmann AG; and with the French Compagnie Générale des Eaux. But the negotiations came to nothing, and no acceptable offer was made. No one was prepared to take on the entire infrastructure, so that the facilities of little commercial interest, such as roads and pipe bridges, would have remained in the hands of the Treuhand. Nor would the potential buyers accept any safeguards to provide protection against what would be a de facto monopoly in such things as energy and water supplies, and they refused to bear the risks for site development and consumption if large customers preferred to make their own arrangements. It became clear that if any of the potential buyers were to take over the entire infrastructure the privatisation operation at the site would be a great deal more expensive and, indeed, that its success might be endangered.\nAt the beginning of 1994, alongside its efforts to privatise the infrastructure as a single package, the Treuhand opened negotiations with various investors regarding the sale of separate lots. However, these efforts too had to be broken off without success at the end of 1994: many of the potential buyers demanded impracticable guarantees of turnover; several lots proved unsaleable; it was not possible to coordinate the individual awards; and there was no discernible economic advantage either to the Treuhand or to the site.\nEarly in 1994, faced with the prospect that the negotiations under way at the time would fail, the Treuhand convened what was called a \"site conference\", which was intended to carry the privatisation process forward and to sound out any impetus for new approaches. The companies on the site were asked to develop ideas and to discuss them. Other participants were Thyssen-Sonnenberg and Westdeutsche Instandhaltungsgesellschaft, who were interested in carrying out renovation and maintenance work. The conference produced a scheme for an integrated infrastructure corporation, in which the firms on the site would take holdings, and which would not merely manage and reorganise the infrastructure but would also be responsible for developing the site and privatising the remaining land and product lines. However, although the scheme was designed jointly, the firms were very reluctant to take shares in this site-management corporation. Ultimately, only Linde and Caproleuna proved willing to enter into negotiations. In October 1994 a statement of intent was agreed, and in November a preliminary contract was concluded for the purchase of 51 % of the shares in the infrastructure corporation, which had yet to be established. The corporation was set up legally on 15 February 1995, under the name InfraLeuna Infrastruktur und Service GmbH, and began operations on 1 January 1996. On 22 May 1996 the privatisation agreement with Linde and Caproleuna was signed, with retroactive effect from 1 January 1996. Caproleuna and Linde each took 25,5 % of the shares in InfraLeuna, while 49 % remained with the Treuhand's successor organisation, the BvS. The price paid was DEM 1,53 million, equal to 51 % of InfraLeuna's DEM 3 million capital. It is intended to persuade other investors on the site to take the shares held by the BvS so that, if possible, all of them will ultimately participate in InfraLeuna.\n3. The scheme\nThe Treuhand organised the privatisation on the basis of the characteristics of the site as it found it, and Leuna has accordingly become a cluster of dissimilar and legally independent chemical production plants. Site servicing is a great deal more complex than what is needed on conventional industrial estates, because of the measure of mutual dependence which exists, the variety of infrastructure networks, especially pipelines and pipe bridges, and the links with such things as roads, railways, waste-water disposal systems and energy supplies. The manufacturers on the site are dependent on supplies of various raw materials, and need an efficient infrastructure to deliver them. Because of the lack of assured availability of power, gas, etc., the buyers of privatised firms frequently made it a condition that the Treuhand, or later the BvS, should guarantee the provision of particular services. As the privatisation process progressed, therefore, an extremely complex structure of contracts emerged under which the BvS was bound by extensive supply obligations to a variety of investors. But after 40 years of a planned economy the existing facilities were in a dilapidated condition and in need of thoroughgoing renovation and overhaul. Yet at the same time as renovation went ahead, privatisation and development had to continue and new firms had to be accommodated on the site.\nIt was in the interests of the firms already present that the infrastructure should be provided at an attractive price, and that the range of firms on the site should ensure them a supply of the particular intermediate products or raw materials they needed and provide outlets for their own products.\nThe scheme arrived at is the one most likely to meet the special needs of the site and to do justice to the interest of the BvS and of the investors. InfraLeuna is to manage the restructuring and undertake the investment needed to improve and modernise the site infrastructure. It is to continue development of the site and to seek new investors so that the remaining industrial sections of the site and product lines can be sold. Suitable buildings and land inside the site have been transferred to InfraLeuna for this purpose, amounting to a total of some 190 ha available for newcomers. It is also to provide the operational infrastructure and the necessary services at the site, allowing the exchange and transport of goods and ensuring supply to the firms. This phase of the restructuring is to be completed by 31 December 2000.\nThe investors are required to plan and organise their own infrastructure, in a mechanism approaching that of a cooperative society. Their involvement ensures that InfraLeuna has the necessary expertise and know-how. Thus they are in a position to judge which products will fit best into the overall pattern so that the structure of firms on the site can be expanded sensibly. Their closeness to the site ensures that the services offered can be tailored to real needs, superfluous facilities avoided, and costs kept down. Their membership of the company makes them suppliers as well as consumers; they have an interest in keeping prices low, while nevertheless covering the costs of the facilities and services offered. They also have a greater interest in the additional integration effects which can be secured if fresh arrivals contribute to successful and balanced development of the site, improving sales of their own products and ensuring inexpensive supplies of the materials they need for their own business.\nThe scheme offered the BvS the possibility of transferring its privatisation function and all its related obligations to InfraLeuna. InfraLeuna has also taken over supply and service contracts concluded by LWS and LWG in connection with the privatisations, releasing them from their supply obligations towards the investors on the site.\nThus the respective interests of the parties were the basis of the scheme and an essential condition of its success: the BvS was under an obligation to carry out its public mandate to privatise the site and to perform the contracts it had concluded in the course of privatisation, while the firms on the site needed a functioning infrastructure at an acceptable price and a process of rational settlement of new investors. The BvS consequently had an interest in keeping the costs of development as low as possible and in securing a guarantee that the infrastructure manager would not misuse its monopoly position. Such a guarantee could be given only by firms which had located on the site themselves, since it would be against their own interests to raise the prices of InfraLeuna's services and to establish and exploit monopolies.\nIn addition to being the only firms on the site interested at this stage in acquiring shares in InfraLeuna, Caproleuna and Linde were also the right partners for the task. As established chemicals firms they possessed sufficient expertise to be able to canvass and negotiate with firms that might be interested in setting up on the site, and had extensive knowledge of structure of the chemicals industry, its technical and economic aspects, and its development. They were in a position to judge and plan the effects of the integration of new arrivals, and had the necessary contacts, experience and qualified staff. As the largest manufacturing companies on the site, they had a strong interest in seeing InfraLeuna develop successfully within a short time: Caproleuna is a large or at least medium consumer of almost all the services offered and can expect further cooperative integration effects from any new firms that might move in. Linde can expect greater sales of industrial gases only if the site develops well.\nInfraLeuna is consequently not designed to make a profit, but instead is governed by the low-profit principle. This means that it is required to organise its business in such a way that its costs are covered and its cash flow is sufficient to cover current reinvestment and maintenance. It can distribute no more than 10 % of its capital as dividends to the shareholders. Any remaining profit must be retained in the company.\nOn 1 January 1996, InfraLeuna employed 906 people. But the number of employees is steadily being cut down to 600. In 1996, InfraLeuna achieved a turnover of DEM 437 million and in 1997, the figure was DEM 409 million. Ordinary activities resulted in losses of DEM [...](6) in 1996 and DEM [...](7)in 1997, while the ongoing repair work and restructuring measures brought net annual losses of DEM [...](8)in 1996 and DEM [...](9) in 1997. Cash flow totalled DEM [...](10)in 1996 and DEM [...](11) in 1997.\n4. InfraLeuna's activities in detail\n4.1. Investment and restructuring\nIn the first place, the existing facilities have to be repaired, modernised, and adapted to the real needs of the site and to the safety and environmental standards laid down by law or imposed by the authorities. A large proportion of the existing networks and facilities are completely obsolete, neglected and oversized, and can be operated only at a heavy loss owing to the high level of unused capacity and similar factors. The rail network is to be cut back from 156 km to 55 km, the drinking water network from 90 km to 31 km, and the road network from 120 km to 20 km. The BvS, in collaboration with Caproleuna, Linde and experts, has worked out a programme of measures for the site stretching over the period from 1 January 1995 to 31 December 2000, and this has become a business plan forming an integral part of the privatisation contract. The business plan details every measure and investment needed for reconstruction, restructuring, the repair of environmental damage, and so on. InfraLeuna will also make its specialised knowledge available so that changes to the plans which prove necessary as restructuring progresses can be made in full knowledge of the facts. The measures are vital if InfraLeuna is to be able to operate the facilities economically in the long term.\n4.2. Site clearance\nSite clearance comprises all measures taken to dismantle plant and technical facilities, to demolish buildings, to remove and dispose of rubble, excavated material, building materials, plant and stored substances, and to fill and level the site. The clearance plan forms part of the business plan, which also calls for excavation of subsurface rubble where this is made necessary by the planned use of the area. On most sections there are buildings and plant which have served for the production of chemicals for decades and which in view of their ramshackle and contaminated condition are no longer usable. The costs of demolition and disposal are substantial; they frequently cannot be estimated in advance, and are usually several times higher than the price of the land. If it did not clear the site first, InfraLeuna would not be able to interest investors in the possibility of locating there and could not sell those plots. The bulk of the restructuring and clearance work is being put out to Community-wide tender in accordance with Directives 92/50/EEC(12), 93/36/EEC(13) and 93/37/EEC(14) on procedures for the award of public contracts. For other orders and contracts InfraLeuna obtains at least three estimates.\n4.3. Canvassing and new settlement\nInfraLeuna is taking over responsibility for the further privatisation of the site from the BvS. It is conducting an intense advertising campaign for the site in the specialist press, and distributing information packages and brochures it has prepared among potential buyers. It is negotiating with investors and trying to persuade them to buy plots at the site and to invest there.\nLand is sold at the market price for developed industrial sites. The German Government has given the Commission three valuations by independent valuers. The valuers concluded that an average price of more than DEM 25 per m2 would not be obtainable, as there was a surplus of industrial sites in the new Länder.\n4.4. Provision of infrastructure\nInfraLeuna has also taken over from the BvS the responsibility for providing the necessary infrastructure and services on the site. This includes roads, the supply of electricity and steam, the supply of drinking water, fresh water and cooling water, waste-water disposal, laboratory services, electricity-supply cabling, fire-fighting services, posts and telecommunications, provision of bridges to carry pipes for the supply of gases and liquids between the different production lines, waste disposal site, and so on. InfraLeuna also receives revenue from the rental and leasing of sections of buildings in its ownership.\nThose using the services pay charges to InfraLeuna. Pipes and cables are laid at the expense of the recipient firms and are their property; the recipients pay a fee for the use of pipe bridges. When it calculates its prices InfraLeuna is required to comply with certain principles laid down in the privatisation contract. It may not give preference to its own shareholders or place other firms at a disadvantage. In what are known as the \"core\" areas, which are areas of business where it is in a monopoly position (the road network, the rail network, pipe bridges, water supply and disposal, and power generation and distribution), InfraLeuna has to apply a system of charges based on the following principles:\n- the low-profit principle,\n- costs to be allocated in accordance with recognised commercial principles to all consumers on a non-discriminatory basis,\n- prices to be differentiated on the basis of the quantities and services provided,\n- prices to be governed by sliding-scale clauses in accordance with practice in the industry,\n- account to be taken of the necessary reinvestment ratios and financing costs(15),\n- supplies and services to be provided on an arm's-length basis.\nIn other areas, InfraLeuna is to supply its services at prices negotiated with the recipient. Here, too, it is prevented from advantaging or disadvantaging individual recipients.\n5. Funding of InfraLeuna\nThe scheme, including the business plan, was submitted for appraisal by the BvS Steering Committee(16); the end result is that InfraLeuna is to receive total funding of DEM 1,13 billion. Altogether, the BvS is to provide DEM 730 million of this, while the Land of Saxony-Anhalt is to provide DEM 300 million for investment under the nationwide regional aid scheme(17). The Commission had previously authorised investment costs of DEM 100 million for the year 1995 in Decision 96/545/EC concerning aid proposed by Germany to Buna GmbH, Sächsische Olefinwerke GmbH, Leuna-Werke GmbH, Leuna-Polyolefine GmbH, and BSL Polyolefinverbund GmbH(18).\nBreakdown of InfraLeuna's total funding\nTABLE\nInitially, in the business plan, the BvS, Caproleuna and Linde estimated the restructuring and investment costs at DEM 960 million. But after careful study of the catalogue of measures they had drawn up, the Steering Committee came to the conclusion that these costs were exaggerated, and reduced them by DEM 160 million, to DEM 800 million. The business plan called for investments totalling DEM 550 million by the beginning of 1998. Owing to delays, however, only DEM 275 million was actually invested by that time, so that the programme is running late, but the remaining measures are still being taken.\nThe BvS undertook to provide a total of DEM 250 million for site clearance. For the year 1996 it also granted InfraLeuna a further DEM 135 million under paragraph 249h of the Employment Promotion Act(19). In the event that this funding for costs of materials was not spent in its entirety in the year 1996, the BvS undertook to pay InfraLeuna the difference, provided that it was used for the same measures(20). When the Commission initiated proceedings, it worked on the assumption that the money taken up under the Employment Promotion Act in 1996 would total DEM 100 million, and concluded that the extra to be considered would amount to DEM 35 million. In the event, the sum taken up in 1996 was only DEM 35,4 million, so that the difference to be made up by the BvS amounted to DEM 99,6 million. Following negotiations, the BvSsucceeded in having its liability reduced to DEM 38 million, so that the financing it is to provide for site clearance measures will amount to a maximum of DEM 288 million. According to information supplied by the German Government, spending on site clearance will turn out about DEM 100 million lower than the cost originally calculated. Here InfraLeuna has had the benefit of a substantial fall in prices.\nUnder paragraph 12 of the privatisation contract, the BvS is bound to make good any losses or negative cash flow arising during the restructuring phase. The approximate cash flow currently forecast on this basis for the period 1996 to 2000 is a positive DEM 36,8 million.\nThe BvS is providing InfraLeuna with working capital of DEM 30 million.\nFurthermore, if the funding provided by the Land of Saxony-Anhalt should turn out to be less than the DEM 300 million planned, the BvS has undertaken to make up the difference under certain strict conditions.\nThe privatisation contract also provides that InfraLeuna has no responsibility under public law or liability under private law for damage caused by the operation of the plant or the use of the land before 1 July 1990 (known as \"inherited liabilities\" (Altlasten)). It is also freed from 90 % of any liability for the cost of protection against hazards arising as a result of damage caused before 1 July 1990, and the cost it may be called on to bear in this connection is limited to DEM 5 million. The German authorities estimate the total expenditure needed here at approximately DEM 150 million.\nBreakdown of funding by source((The table does not include the DEM 100 million for investment and restructuring granted by the BvS in the past, the funding under paragraph 249h of the Employment Promotion Act, and the exemption from inherited liabilities granted by the BvS.))\nTABLE\n6. Payment and monitoring the use of funds\nThe privatisation contract regulates the granting and provision of funds by the BvS. The BvS is to lodge a sum of DEM 657 million in an account with the Landeszentralbank Berlin (\"the Bank\"). This sum is to be entered in InfraLeuna's capital reserve. InfraLeuna does not have sole disposal of the account. The BvS is also to give InfraLeuna a claim for DEM 73 million, which falls due only when the sum in the account is exhausted. The money in the account with the Bank and InfraLeuna's claim on the BvS bear interest of 3,5 % per annum to offset inflation, and this interest is likewise available to InfraLeuna.\nActing in accordance with the liquidity schedule in the business plan, InfraLeuna is to ask the BvS to transfer money to its own business account. Departure from the business plan is possible only with the agreement of the BvS; cases of disagreement are to be settled by a conciliation and arbitration procedure laid down in Article 27 of the privatisation contract. InfraLeuna's resources must remain outside the buyers' group finances. The BvS may refuse to pay if it has reason to doubt whether the funding is being properly used.\nInfraLeuna must report to the BvS every quarter, showing how the money provided has been used. The use of the funding allocated for the compensation of losses must be documented every six months. The documents submitted must be verifiable; the BvS is to be allowed access to InfraLeuna's premises and papers at any time, and is entitled to have the documents examined by an independent expert. Differences of opinion regarding the use of the money are to be settled by the conciliation and arbitration procedure in Article 27. The arbitrator is to be either a certified public accountant nominated by the chairman of the board of the Institute of Certified Public Accountants (Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer), in Düsseldorf, or the Federal Audit Office (Bundesrechnungshof).\n7. Closure of accounts, repayment and incentive clause\nWhen restructuring operation is complete, InfraLeuna is to submit a final account which BvS is free to verify by any means at its disposal. Funds remaining in the account with the Bank and funds called by InfraLeuna but not used by the end of the restructuring phase are to be repaid to the BvS.\nThe BvS is required to pay 25 % of the returned money to each of the buyers, as an incentive to achieve savings. But the sum payable to each may not exceed DEM 20 million, so that savings in excess of a total of DEM 80 million would not result in any increase in the incentive payments.\n8. Neutralisation of losses carried forward beyond the restructuring operation\nInfraLeuna must not be enabled to take advantage of further concessions in addition to the compensation of losses by the BvS after the restructuring operation is complete, by carrying forward losses for purposes of corporation tax or local trade tax. At the end of the restructuring phase, therefore, the current carry-forward of losses will be established by means of a tax audit. InfraLeuna will then repay the entire compensation for losses it has received from the BvS, using the funds in the account with the Bank; the BvS will make an equivalent payment to InfraLeuna to be entered as revenue and attracting tax.\n9. The relevant markets\nThe Commission had to consider whether trade between Member States might be affected. There would certainly be trade between Member States in the products manufactured on the site, which meant that the measures might distort competition. Domo produces synthetic carpet fibres on the site, which is a product in a sensitive industry and is within the scope of the code on aid to the synthetic fibres industry(21). If aid were to be given, therefore, the code might require a capacity reduction in return. However, as far as the services of InfraLeuna itself were concerned, it was rather doubtful whether there would be trade between Member States.\nIII. OBSERVATIONS SUBMITTED BY OTHER INTERESTED PARTIES ON THE INITIATION OF PROCEEDINGS\nAfter it initiated proceedings the Commission received observations from one other Member State, three trade associations and four companies.\nThe Member State argued that the chemicals industry in the region had already received substantial state aid in the past and that strict criteria should be applied in the case of InfraLeuna to ensure that there could be no indirect advantage for Sächsische Olefinwerke and Buna. It calculated that the funding paid out would amount to state aid per job of DEM 1,78 million, easily exceeding the aid intensity permitted in the case of large enterprises, namely 35 %. It was unclear how much money would be used to attract new investors and whether investors in Leuna would qualify for other forms of aid. The Member State acknowledged that the scope for trade between Member States in industrial gases was small. But producers of industrial gases other than Linde ought to have the same opportunities as Linde to compete in the region and establish air separation units in Saxony-Anhalt at the same intensity of state aid. Otherwise it shared the Commission's misgivings and pointed out that the Community code on aid to the synthetic fibres industry applied to the production of polyamide fibres, so that financial assistance might well entail a reduction in capacity.\nThe other observations submitted supported the doubts the Commission had expressed when it initiated the proceedings. The trade associations drew attention to the distorting effect on trade in caprolactam and polyamide fibres between Member States. They pointed to the sensitivity of the industry, in which capacity utilisation had been running at only 71 % in 1996. They stressed the indirect effect that the aid towards the production of caprolactam could have on the production of polyamide fibres if a single producer were to produce both products. As it seemed highly unlikely that InfraLeuna could be profitable, the measures being taken by the BvS could be regarded only as a means of enabling the manufacturers on the Leuna site, specially Linde and Caproleuna, to reduce their production costs and thereby increase their competitiveness. According to the trade associations's information, spending on services of this kind often accounted for up to 30 % of the total cost of the final product. They feared that InfraLeuna would offer its services below cost and that final consumers would enjoy those services without having to provide them themselves or to pay an appropriate price to a supplier. They were especially concerned at the prospect of compensation of losses of up to DEM 150 million, which would lead to manifest distortion of competition. They contended that the measures ran directly counter to the efforts of the European chemicals industry to maintain and improve its international competitiveness.\nThe competitors pointed out that Caproleuna was a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Domo group [...](22). The Beaulieu group accounted for about 54 % of all European polyamide carpet fibre production. Aid to InfraLeuna would result in an unjustified and lasting improvement in the competitiveness of Caproleuna, thus adversely affecting the competitiveness of other manufacturers, and would help Domo [...](23) to consolidate its dominant position on the market. The fear was expressed that the measures would very probably affect the prices of caprolactam and its intermediate products.\nTwo of the interested parties also feared that Caproleuna and Linde would offload advertising costs onto InfraLeuna. They referred to advertising for the site that had appeared in European chemical news. InfraLeuna had there used the names of Caproleuna and Linde to advertise the site.\nIn its reply the German Government argued that there could be no distorting effect on competition, as the payments to InfraLeuna served to cover spending on services of general interest and on hazard protection.\nThe measures being financed were a necessary condition for the continued operation of the site, for the privatisation of the plant and land, and consequently for the completion of privatisation which the BvS had a public mandate to carry out. The elimination of inherited liabilities, site clearance, and the provision of infrastructure had no effect on competition, as the state measures merely served to bring the land and the plant to a point where it could be privatised.\nThe German Government contended that as no advantage was conferred and there was no effect on competition, there was no state aid within the meaning of Article 92(1) of the EC Treaty. All of InfraLeuna's infrastructure and supply facilities were to be used jointly and concurrently by a large number of firms, against payment, and none would serve for particular product lines only. Plant of that kind would have to be provided by the firms involved themselves, on their own responsibility and at their own expense. Taking over the cost of providing an efficient infrastructure in Leuna could not affect competition, because competitors at other locations in market-economy systems never had to bear comparable costs, and the companies on the Leuna site were not being relieved of costs that firms usually had to bear. Quite the reverse: without state assistance no investor would have been prepared to bear the expense of overhauling the infrastructure in Leuna, given the backlog of repairs that had accumulated over decades. There was simply no possibility that a private party might take over the inherited installations in their dilapidated condition and undertake the clearance, disposal and replacement work necessary. The case had no precedent in western Europe, and the necessity for the measures that were being taken arose directly out of the circumstances of the planned economy and the mismanagement which had taken place. A further ground for maintaining that no advantage had been conferred was that the financing was confined to the absolute minimum, and all measures taken had been examined to ensure that they were necessary and proportionate; where required they had been put out to public tender. The prices that final consumers would be paying for InfraLeuna's services were ordinary market prices, and would cover costs.\nConsequently, an assessment on the basis of the jobs preserved was not possible either, as the financial contribution was being made in performance of public obligations, and bore no relation to the preservation of employment.\nThe shareholders in InfraLeuna could not earn a return of more than 10 % on the capital they had subscribed. Because of the restricted financial prospects this offered, it could not be expected of them that they should invest substantial capital of their own in InfraLeuna. The functioning of the plan rested instead on a balance between conflicting interests which were only indirectly of a material nature, so that payment of the price for the use of InfraLeuna's services constituted a proportionate consideration, and no further contribution could be expected.\nInvestors wishing to settle in Saxony-Anhalt would find comparable terms at other sites, and there was nothing to prevent them from taking advantage of such terms because there was in fact a surplus of industrial sites.\nThe German Government contended that, contrary to the misgivings which had been expressed, the loss-compensation arrangement was not operating aid which would help to keep unprofitable plant in operation. InfraLeuna had the exceptional task of keeping the installations in operation during the restructuring process so that the necessary services were available on the site. This involved enormous additional costs by comparison with normal operation, because the installations were obsolete and oversized, and so could not be operated efficiently, and also because in order to maintain them special steps had to be taken, such as bypasses, alternative circuits, etc. Thus the compensation of losses merely served to bridge the difficult period necessary to enable InfraLeuna to operate in the long term efficiently, economically and without further assistance. The flexibility between the budget items had been decided because at the time the privatisation contract was concluded it was not possible to estimate the scale of the different risks. On the basis of a worst-case scenario, it was agreed for safety to allow for an increase to DEM 150 million.\nThe German Government denied that the funding was being misused by including Caproleuna and Linde in the advertising for the site. InfraLeuna's advertising mentioned the names of firms that were already operating successfully on the site. It was hoped that this would promote and consolidate the image of the site as a location for the chemicals industry. Agreements of this kind had been concluded not only with Caproleuna and Linde but also with Chemtec Leuna and Leuna Harze GmbH, and it was expected that similar agreements would be concluded with Leuna Polymer, Atochem and Spezialchemie Leuna GmbH. InfraLeuna and the firm involved would each bear half of the cost.\nIV. ASSESSMENT\nIt has to be settled whether or not the measures are within the scope of Article 92(1) of the EC Treaty. Article 92(1) states that aid is incompatible with the common market if it is granted by a Member State or through state resources, favours certain undertakings or the production of certain goods, and thereby distorts or threatens to distort competition, in so far as it affects trade between Member States.\nArticle 92(2) and (3) lays down exceptions to this general prohibition.\nThe assistance given to InfraLeuna by the Land of Saxony-Anhalt and the BvS is granted through state resources. The Land of Saxony-Anhalt is part of the federal structure of Germany and, as a constituent state of the federation, shares in public authority. The BvS is likewise a public body. It finances its activities with public money, and acts as a public institution whose terms of reference require it to privatise the enterprises in its keeping on behalf of the authorities and in the public interest.\nArticle 92(1) is intended to prevent trade between Member States from being affected by state aid. The Court of Justice of the European Communities has repeatedly held that the only question here is the effect of the measure, and not its motivation, form or aims(24). A measure will therefore be caught by Article 92(1) only if it really affects trade between Member States and distorts competition.\nIn pursuance of this principle, then, the effects of the measures must be considered one by one in order to determine whether there is state aid within the meaning of Article 92(1).\n1. The costs of site clearance\nThe BvS is making DEM 288 million available for site clearance. Including funding of DEM 35,4 million received under the Employment Promotion Act in 1996, therefore, InfraLeuna has a total of up to DEM 323,4 million at its disposal for site clearance. The use made of the money has to be documented every quarter, under paragraph 14(3) of the privatisation contract. In the course of the proceedings, the German Government has assured the Commission that InfraLeuna puts the clearance work out to tender or, where that is not a legal requirement, calls in at least three reliable estimates.\nThe decision to carry on and privatise the chemicals industry sites in the former German Democratic Republic was taken at the time of unification or shortly thereafter. If investors were to be attracted to the Leuna site it was essential that the site be cleared and cleaned; the Treuhand accordingly approved an outline clearance plan and began work. Under paragraph 10 of the privatisation contract, the obligation to clear the site passed to InfraLeuna, and led to the present clearance plan. During the restructuring phase InfraLeuna is required to dismantle, demolish, clear and dispose of the obsolete or superfluous plant, equipment and other objects on the site. The Commission observes that most of the buildings are badly contaminated and that in some cases rubble has to be excavated below ground level and contaminated soil removed after demolition.\nFrom the information supplied by the German Government, it is clear that the site would have had to be cleared in any event, regardless of the identity of the buyers or the business they carried on, and that site clearance had been decided on before the transfer to InfraLeuna. In addition, the work is not being carried out in order to favour a particular undertaking, but rather in order to render the land on the chemicals site usable. Purchasers buy the land at a price of about DEM 25 per m2, which corresponds to the market price for comparable ready-to-use services industrial sites in the new Länder(25). It is clear, therefore, that the assumption of the cost of clearance by the public authorities does not favour InfraLeuna or the buyers of the land(26).\nThe conclusion must therefore be that the DEM 288 million made available for site clearance does not fall within the scope of Article 92(1).\n2. The costs of environmental damage\nIn paragraph 17 of the privatisation contract, BvS releases InfraLeuna from any liability for the cost of environmental damage already in existence before the date on which the management of the assets is actually transferred, or which is caused by a factor already in existence at that date but which itself arises as a result of industrial exploitation during the restructuring phase. This paragraph 17 provides that the environmental damage is to be investigated by an independent valuer, and that the BvS must approve the plan of costs and measures presented by InfraLeuna before it is put in to effect. Here, too, InfraLeuna is required to obtain at least three estimates for each measure from three competent contractors; the BvS is entitled to collaborate in the drafting of the tenders, to supervise progress and to approve the finished work. In the course of the proceedings Germany estimated the cost at DEM 150 million.\nWhen it approved the transfer date in the first Treuhand decision(27), the Commission found that the provision of public resources for environmental improvement and protection measures caused before 1 July 1990 did not constitute state aid. Firms in the new Länder could not be held responsible for pollution of the environment occasioned under the system of the former German Democratic Republic, when they had had no say in the matter. The Commission and the German Government have agreed that the greater part of the pollution in evidence was caused before 1 July 1990 and that it is not possible to quantify the remainder, which derives from the operation or existence of the plant after that date. Firms in the new Länder could not adapt their plant to the standards of the old Länder immediately on 1 July 1990. The closure of plant and adaptation to the legal requirements would take time, while the pollution caused would inevitably continue.\nUnder point 3.2.2 of the Community guidelines on state aid for environmental protection(28), such aid for investment to repair past damage to the environment may not fall under Article 92(1) of the EC Treaty in cases where the person responsible for the pollution cannot be identified or called to account, in that the aid does not confer a gratuitous financial benefit on particular firms or industries. However, with reference to InfraLeuna the Commission took into account that the company would be released from a statutory obligation as owner of the polluted land. The Commission therefore applied point 3.4 of the guidelines: here, an exception can be made to the \"polluter pays\" principle laid down in point 1.2 of the Community guidelines and in Article 130r(2) of the EC Treaty, and the aid can instead be allowed as operating aid, relieving InfraLeuna of the costs resulting from pollution. Moreover, the unquantifiable part does not favour the buyers, since they pay a market price to acquire the land.\nThe conclusion must therefore be that only part of the DEM 150 million cost of releasing InfraLeuna from liability for environmental damage constitutes state aid, and the amount involved is impossible to quantify. It is, however, compatible with the common market.\n3. The costs of investment and restructuring\nDuring its investigations the Commission proceeded on the assumption that the investment and restructuring contributions from the BvS and the Land of Saxony-Anhalt might have the effect of favouring final consumers and InfraLeuna and its members.\nThe German Government argued that the contributions to the restructuring and investment should not be classed as aid as they did not have the effect of favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods and hence did not restrict competition or affect trade between Member States. They remedied past omissions and represented costs which no undertakings in western Europe other than in the new Länder had to bear. An infrastructure had to be created which served only to perform public tasks in the sense of the provision of basic public services and hence did not favour any particular undertaking or the production of any particular good. The BvS had been unable to influence the situation on the ground and had had to accept the one that it had inherited. It was accordingly obliged to privatise the product lines piecemeal and the infrastructure en bloc. Under the restructuring, only DEM 38 million would be used for building entirely new facilities. This included parts of the central waste-water system (DEM 15 million), a central freight clearance building (DEM 4,5 million), a central service centre for tank cleaning (DEM 13 million), a gas reduction and distribution system (DEM 2,9 million), and various pipe bridges, etc. These facilities would be available, against appropriate payment, to all firms on the site. On the other hand some DEM 115 million would be needed for replacement investment (such as for adapting facilities to bring them up to environmental and safety standards, scaling-down in line with requirements). In keeping with the BvS's public mandate, infrastructure repair and construction for the site was a sine qua non for its privatisation. In view of the state of the plants and the related costs, no private investor had been willing to take them over without a substantial contribution from the public purse. For instance, DEM 547 million was needed for modernisation, including renovation. But because of overlaps it was not always easy to draw a clear line between the different items. Simply for rail, fresh water, waste water, sewerage, road, drinking water and fire-fighting services, requirements totalled DEM 171,7 million for renovation and DEM 277 million for capitalisable investment. Thus the only other option had been for the BvS to continue to operate the infrastructure. That being so, the BvS would have had to assume all costs, bearing the risk of the restructuring failing and of having to run the plants itself. The expenditure was thus entirely a matter for, and the responsibility of, the public authorities, the BvS having merely transferred its responsibility for restructuring and reorganising the plants to a private operator.\n3.1. Favouring of final consumers/pricing\nThe Commission proceeded on the assumption that producers on the site would be favoured indirectly if InfraLeuna offered its services at below cost. It was unclear to what extent the cost of renovation would be borne by the resident production companies. An unjustified cost reduction would, in the Commission's view, have led to a distortion of competition that would have affected trade between Member States.\nThe Commission also had misgivings about whether InfraLeuna's obligation to abide by the low-profit principle might lead to customers being further favoured, since prices might be kept artificially low, an advantage not enjoyed by consumers elsewhere.\nThe Commission accordingly examined how InfraLeuna set its prices. Under Article 15 of the privatisation contract, InfraLeuna is in principle required to offer its services to all undertakings, favouring or disfavouring none. The privatisation contract distinguishes between so-called \"core\" areas, in which InfraLeuna holds a monopoly, and other areas of activity. To rule out the possibility of abuse of a monopoly position, the price calculation for these monopoly areas is explicitly laid down. InfraLeuna is required to divide all costs, applying recognised business principles, among all customers. This includes depreciation, financing, reinvestment and maintenance costs. Prices must be differentiated according to quantity and service, and sliding-scale formulae must be used, paying due regard to the low-profit principle. In the other areas, InfraLeuna must offer its services on the terms and at the prices normally obtaining in the industry. It may negotiate them freely, but here too it must take account of the low-profit principle.\nThe above provisions, in combination with the underlying overall plan, convinced the Commission that sufficient safeguards were in place to rule out any direct favouring of customers. In the areas where it has a monopoly, InfraLeuna is required to pass on all its costs to its customers. By including depreciation in the price calculation, any increases in value and all maintenance and restructuring costs are passed on to consumers, who thus share the costs through the prices payable. The Commission notes that any subsidising of prices by payments from the authorities is ruled out, as rates are calculated independently from these payments, and in particular from the loss compensation payments, and reflect only actual expenditure irrespective of the origin of the funds. The price calculations also include the opportunity cost of interest payments in accordance with recognised commercial principles, and the costs entailed by InfraLeuna's activities (including development costs). In the course of the proceedings, the German Government submitted to the Commission numerous supply contracts between InfraLeuna and various customers and described the cost calculations used in various fields. This satisfied the Commission that the prices charged for InfraLeuna's services do fall within the normal range and are by no means especially favourable.\nThe Commission discussed with the German Government the possibility of introducing the pricing system described above for InfraLeuna's other areas of activity as well. It perceived in particular a risk of price subsidisation through the loss compensation payable inasmuch as the privatisation contract required InfraLeuna only to supply \"on the terms normally obtaining in the industry and at the most favourable prices possible\". The German Government remarked in this connection that the strict price provisions in respect of the monopoly were intended as an additional safeguard to prevent any abuse of the monopoly position through unjustified price increases, thereby keeping prices down. There was no such risk in the other areas of activity. InfraLeuna faced competition there, which compelled it to align itself on its competitors and fix prices accordingly. Introducing the pricing system would be superfluous and would simply be an additional burden. The desired result of preventing any abuse of the monopoly position and keeping prices down could be achieved in these areas by market forces alone.\nThe Commission accepted the German Government's arguments in part. Basically it was in the members' interests to offer InfraLeuna's services at a cost-covering price, but it had to be remembered that the members were at the same time consumers of those services and hence had at least as great an interest in being able to obtain them as cheaply as possible. In the Commission's view it was therefore essential to the system's operation that an additional safeguard be built in which might help to rule out any price subsidisation and which gave the members an incentive actually to set prices at a cost-covering level. The Commission and the German Government agreed that the exclusion of any lump-sum loss compensation was an appropriate means to this end. This would rule out both the inclusion of any loss compensation when calculating prices and costs, and the subsidising of prices through such loss compensation.\nThe Commission also examined whether InfraLeuna's obligation to apply the low-profit principle represented a lightening of the burden on resident companies that was relevant from an aid point of view and likely to restrict competition. Setting a price can, in principle, be regarded as aid where it is attributable to action by the Member State concerned and where the requirements of Article 92 of the EC Treaty are met. In such a situation the Member State, or the entity under its control, does not apply the price like an ordinary economic agent but uses it to confer a pecuniary advantage on a company, foregoing the profit which it could normally realise(29).\nThe Commission therefore had to decide whether the commitment to the low-profit principle was attributable to government action and hence was to be classed as \"aid granted by a Member State or through state resources\". Account had to be taken here of the fact that InfraLeuna took the form of a quasi-cooperative society, of the particular circumstances in which it had been set up, and of the fact that only a minority shareholding was in public ownership. Under German law the peculiarity of the cooperative as an organisational form is that it \"seeks to promote the trade or business of its members through the common conduct of their business activities\"(30). The main objective, then, is to facilitate the economic activity of the parties through cooperation and common organisation rather than to promote the realisation of profit through the society's activities, although this is not ruled out altogether. The BvS, in conjunction with the other members, deliberately opted for this course in order to ease the site's privatisation. The scheme is based on the cooperative ideal and will work only if, through cooperation in InfraLeuna, the investors themselves provide the necessary services on the site at a low cost. The current minority stake of the public authorities is only a transitional measure of a temporary nature pending the sale of the BvS's shares to other investors.\nThe Commission found on balance that the commitment to the low-profit principle did not constitute conferring an advantage attributable to action by the German Government. Rather it is an essential precondition for the working of the privatisation plan and has to be seen in the context of the notion of the cooperative, as rooted in German law.\n3.2. Favouring of InfraLeuna\nInfraLeuna receives the financial support direct and can freely dispose of the funds. The facilities it owns are being modernised with the help of public resources to bring them up to a state-of-the-art standard. The question arises, however, whether InfraLeuna was favoured from an economic point of view by the grants, as economic advantage flows not only from the fact of ownership itself, but also from the economic exploitability of the thing owned and the opportunities available for turning it to advantage.\nIn answering this question, the Commission took into consideration the fact that InfraLeuna's objects are narrowly defined, its activities being limited to the provision of infrastructure services and the privatisation of the remaining industrial sites. The conduct of its affairs has to be entirely subordinated to this goal. Any divestiture, sale or lease of individual businesses or parts thereof requires a unanimous resolution of the members. InfraLeuna cannot therefore dispose freely of its property, tied as this is to its objects. It is also bound by the low-profit principle. The use of any profits to increase its capital is ruled out. Any amendment to, extension of, or departure from this principle again requires a unanimous members' resolution.\nIn the light of the above, the Commission came to the conclusion that InfraLeuna was not to be regarded as favoured from an economic point of view by the measures. InfraLeuna does not derive any actual economic benefit from the plants by maintaining and modernising them, because they are governed entirely by its objects and because it is obliged as a matter of principle to earn low profits from its activities. In order to improve monitoring and prevent facilities from being sold and used for purposes other than those for which they were intended, the Commission considers that the BvS should retain at least a 1 % share in InfraLeuna pending completion of the restructuring drive.\n3.3. Favouring of the members\nThe fact that Caproleuna and Linde were at one and the same time site developers, operators and end-users of the infrastructure caused particular difficulties when it came to assessing the aid measures. It was to be feared that they might unduly exploit their position as members to the detriment of other resident companies in order to create, with the help of public resources, an infrastructure on the site that was specifically tailored to their needs. Nor could it be ruled out that superfluous plants might be built at inflated prices, as the Commission was unable for the time being to determine to what extent the uses to which the resources were put would be monitored. There was also a risk that Caproleuna and Linde might earn substantial profits from their participation in InfraLeuna without giving any commensurate quid pro quo.\n3.3.1. Favouring of shareholders as customers of InfraLeuna\nThe Commission considered first of all to what extent the members might be able to obtain preferential terms (for example, lower prices than other purchasers) for the use of InfraLeuna's services. It should be noted here that InfraLeuna is subject to a ban on discrimination, being prohibited from distinguishing between customers and from applying anything other than objective criteria to the services it renders. The ban on discrimination may be modified only by a unanimous members' resolution. There is a further control mechanism in the form of InfraLeuna's membership structure. InfraLeuna will ultimately be completely privatised, with the BvS selling its shares to other investors on the site, thus ensuring the spreading of interests. Various companies have, in fact, submitted binding offers and up to 4 % of the BvS's shares are currently up for sale. Steag and MEAG will each take 12,25 %, Rhodia GmbH 10 %, and InfraLeuna Beteiligungs GmbH will also acquire 10 % of InfraLeuna's shares. InfraLeuna Beteiligungs GmbH was founded by five investors on the site exclusively for the purpose of buying the shares. None of the undertakings is linked to Linde or Caproleuna. The effectiveness of the respective purchase agreements is subject to the suspensive condition of approval of the privatisation plan by the Commission. This bundling of the various interests ensures that no single member receives favourable treatment, since the membership structure allows members to monitor one another and obliges them to take balanced account of the others' points of view.\nThe Commission concluded that the existing mechanisms are indeed likely to prevent a member from taking advantage of its position in order to secure a preferential status for itself. Customer contracts are concluded by InfraLeuna's management, acting on instructions from the members' general meeting. Under the articles of association, the management needs prior consent in the form of a unanimous members' resolution before it can conclude contracts with members of InfraLeuna if the total value of the contract exceeds DEM 1 million a year or DEM 5 million over the contract's lifetime. A system of two-way checks has thus been put in place, and decision-making by the members' general meeting is shaped by the various positions and interests and must take these into account.\nSince the Commission considers one of the key difficulties of this case to be the possibility that a member might take advantage of its position, the monitoring system as described must in its opinion be consolidated. The following points must be acted on:\n- Article 11 of InfraLeuna's articles of association must be amended so as to provide that Article 6(5)(a) of those articles (requirement of prior unanimous consent of the members' general meeting for the conclusion of contracts with members) may be amended or deleted only by a unanimous members' resolution. A provision must be also added to InfraLeuna's articles of association stating that this clause may not be amended for a period of at least 15 years after the restructuring is completed,\n- the value threshold on the requirement for unanimous consent does not go far enough, as it may be possible to circumvent the rule using certain contractual provisions. The provision in Article 6(5)(a) limiting the unanimous consent requirement to contracts with members where the total value exceeds DEM 1 million a year or DEM 5 million over the contract's lifetime must therefore be deleted so that all contracts are subject to the requirement of unanimous consent,\n- Article 13(4) and Article 3 of InfraLeuna's articles of association must be amended to provide that the limitation on profit distribution and InfraLeuna's binding commitment to the low-profit principle must remain in place for at least 15 years after the restructuring is completed,\n- as was explained, monitoring rests on the basic principle that the members' general meeting ensures a spread of interests. To guarantee this, a member or a related or ancillary company must not be allowed to acquire more than 24,5 % of the shares in InfraLeuna for at least 15 years after the restructuring is completed.\n3.3.2. Favouring as shareholders\nThe Commission examined to what extent Caproleuna and Linde would be favoured in their capacity as shareholders by the contributions from the BvS and the Land. It had to be borne in mind here that the members had paid only the nominal value (DEM 1,53 million) for their 51 % shareholding, whereas it had to be assumed that the fixed assets, and possibly the shares themselves, might increase in value substantially as the measures went forward, and this could be realised by selling them. Since any such increase in value would be due solely to payments from the public purse, the Commission saw the possibility of making a sizeable profit through selling assets and shares or through dividends as an advantage to the members that might be relevant from an aid point of view.\nThe Commission established that, as far as their usability was concerned, InfraLeuna's fixed assets were strictly confined to their prescribed purposes and required the unanimous consent of the members' general meeting before they could be sold. Under paragraph 15(2) of the privatisation contract, InfraLeuna is obliged to run the facilities for a period of 15 years from the transfer date (1 January 1996). Plant is always written off by the straight-line method over a long period, depending on its lifetime, and so the book value does not tally with the actual value. This seems to rule out the possibility of the shareholders' obtaining an additional advantage from selling the assets, as they will have been written off, that is to say, their value will be minimal after more than 15 years of use. Moreover, the cost of dismantling individual plants is so high that the scrap value, especially after 15 years, will scarcely cover it. The dividends earned by the members from their participation in InfraLeuna are limited to no more than 10 % of its capital, and in the event of a transfer of shares to other shareholders the restrictions as to use still apply to the purchaser.\nThe Commission concluded that in these circumstances the possibility of the shareholders being favoured could essentially be ruled out. Realising the net asset value of the plants was de facto impossible as the demolition costs would, as a rule, exceed the scrap value and hence would scarcely be recoverable. Any sale of assets would, moreover, provide only the company and not the members with resources, the use of which was subject to the restrictions described earlier as regards distribution among members. Even if an asset's book value were to increase, it appears impossible for this to lead to any appreciable increase in the market value of the company's shares beyond their nominal value, as an increase in the effective earning-power value is excluded by the commitment to the low-profit principle, the limiting of the maximum dividend to 10 % of the capital, and the continuing restrictions as to use placed on a purchaser. This prevents the members from appropriating, through the payment of large dividends, the value of the state-aided assets and makes the acquisition of shares unattractive to an investor outside the site. The Commission also took into account that from a fixed-interest investment in the capital markets a minimum dividend of 4 to 5 % can be earned, and that with greater risk-taking 10 % is easily attainable. In 1997 a dividend of up to 40 % could be earned from shares. Consequently, and bearing in mind that the likelihood of InfraLeuna's turning in a profit, and hence making a dividend payment, is fairly slim and that the investment is therefore rather risky, a maximum dividend of 10 % is appropriate.\nIn view of the above, the Commission concluded that the members were not favoured from an economic point of view. To exclude any unjustified advantage whatsoever, the Commission has asked Germany to have the market value of the shares assessed by an independent expert. The valuation must be based on InfraLeuna's capitalised value over 15 years and non-distributed profits. The price that purchasers pay for shares must correspond to the market value determined in this way. If the market value of the shares were actually found to be higher than their nominal value, Caproleuna and Linde AG would have to pay the difference to the BvS. In addition, InfraLeuna must be obliged to run the facilities for 15 years after the restructuring is completed (31 December 2000). Article 15(2) of the privatisation contract therefore needs to be changed accordingly, thereby ensuring that the value of the facilities after more than 15 years of use will indeed be so far reduced as to rule out the possibility of making a profit from any sale.\n3.3.3. Favouring as site developers\nThe Commission feared that Caproleuna and Linde in their role as site developers might influence the construction of installations in such a way that they met their own requirements, thereby placing them at an advantage. Nor was it apparent to what extent expenditure would be monitored to check the necessity of individual measures and the scale of the costs. In the Commission's opinion there was a risk that either Caproleuna and Linde or the contractors who carried out the work might claim excessive costs and in so doing waste public money. A further problem area was the payment to Caproleuna and Linde of incentives amounting to 25 % of any funds not spent and returned to the BvS.\nThe Commission established first of all that Caproleuna and Linde had only limited influence over the implementation of the restructuring and investment measures. The necessary measures had been decided on before InfraLeuna was formed and before the privatisation contract was signed. The Commission was therefore satisfied that the business plan attached to and forming part of the privatisation contract set forth all the planned measures and that the restructuring programme had accordingly been laid down before the privatisation contract was concluded. The business plan describes in detail the individual measures, the relevant sites, the particular part of a building, etc., including the estimated costs. Employees of Caproleuna, Linde and the BvS took part in formulating the business plan, as did a number of independent experts. The BvS's Steering Committee carried out an audit, which resulted in the costs as originally estimated being reduced from DEM 960 million to DEM 800 million(31). Revisions of and amendments to the business plan may be decided on by the members' general meeting by a simple majority. However, there are checks and balances in that the BvS can oppose the modified business plan. In this event, the members' general meeting must reach unanimity on the changes to the plan. Should agreement not be reached, the difference will be settled in an objective mediation and arbitration proceeding under paragraph 27 of the privatisation contract.\nIn the light of the above mechanisms and the fact that the investment and restructuring programme was laid down before privatisation, the Commission concluded that it would be basically impossible for Caproleuna and Linde to tailor the installations to their special requirements. This will be monitored in any event, as the German Government has been asked to submit quarterly investment reports, checked by an independent expert beforehand as regards the costs and the necessity of the measures.\nAs far as the ongoing control of expenditure is concerned, the Commission established that InfraLeuna applies the provisions of the law on public contracts, and in particular of the Commission's public procurement Directives. For contracts which, under those provisions, do not have to be put out to public tender, InfraLeuna has to seek at least three bids from competent tenderers unless the contracts are only very minor. This was expressly confirmed by the German Government. InfraLeuna has to take the award decision on the basis of cost and quality considerations. Paragraph 11(3)(a) of the privatisation contract provides in this respect that in the event of two or more bids being equal, firms in the new Länder must be given preference. The German Government has given an assurance that this goodwill clause will be deleted in accordance with the Commission's position of 7 July 1997 and Germany's communication of 9 September 1997. As already indicated, InfraLeuna's expenditure is subject to quarterly review by the BvS. Any increase in the amounts provided for in the business plan may be opposed by the BvS, with the result that the members' general meeting subsequently has to agree to it unanimously. In the absence of a consensus, the mediation and arbitration procedure under paragraph 27 of the privatisation contract has to be initiated. If the BvS comes to the conclusion that funds have not been used properly or costs have been overestimated, an attempt must first be made to bring about an agreement between the members, failing which the mediation and arbitration procedure under paragraph 27 of the privatisation contract must be initiated.\nIn the Commission's opinion the BvS has introduced the control mechanisms needed to enable it, not only as a member but also as provider of financing for the necessary investment, to exercise absolute, precise and continuous control over the scale and suitability of the investment and the restructuring measures through its right of approval and opposition. The provisions on putting contracts out to tender and seeking several bids constitute an additional guarantee that costs will not be exceeded and that contracts will be executed at market prices.\nLastly, the Commission views the incentive arrangements as a further control mechanism aimed at cost reduction. The promise to allow Caproleuna and Linde to share in any savings helps to limit the measures to that which is absolutely necessary and therefore warrants approval in principle. In Decision 96/545/EC, for instance, the Commission authorised such an incentive payment to the Dow Chemical Company as aid(32).\nThe Commission then examined both sets of circumstances to see whether they were comparable and whether the incentive arrangements in favour of Caproleuna and Linde might be admissible, as in the case of Dow. Basically, the funds made available to the investors in both cases amounted to a payment from the public purse. Dow took over the production plants from the Treuhand with a view to restructuring them and ultimately operating them at a profit. However, it also put in a substantial amount from its own resources, whereas the financial contribution by Caproleuna and Linde is equivalent only to their nominal stake. On the other hand, they cannot expect any return from their investment in InfraLeuna apart from uncertain dividends amounting to 10 % of the capital at most.\nGermany argued that unlike in the Dow case, where the advantage was mainly, though not solely, on the side of the investors, the participation of the investors in the InfraLeuna case mainly benefited the public purse. The BvS paid the incentives as a consideration for this benefit. Caproleuna and Linde made their know-how available and were entrusted by the BvS with the development of the site, establishing new investors there and providing the infrastructure. They were also making substantial financial and human resources available. Throughout almost the whole of 1995 a team of independent advisers hired by the BvS, Caproleuna and Linde was engaged in drawing up the necessary investment measures and preparing a cost analysis. Moreover, savings were to be made under the guidance of Caproleuna and Linde and the participation of both was therefore altogether desirable. They were the two largest investors on the Leuna site and had considerable experience of implementing restructuring and investment measures, experience which could be put to good use. Against this background the Treuhand at the time proposed that they should both share in all savings, the size of the share being both big enough to serve as an attractive incentive, but not so big as to be out of proportion to the overall volume of the measures. Subsequently a ceiling of DEM 20 million each was finally agreed on. Therefore, in the case of Caproleuna and Linde the incentive was to be regarded as a success-dependent reward for the contribution made by the investors.\nThe Commission, however, could not accept this argument. The InfraLeuna scheme is based on the fundamental assumption that the real advantage to all those involved, including investors and members, lies in providing the infrastructure and attracting new firms to the site. The underlying principle implies that an adequate consideration must be paid for the use of the services to cover all the costs, including development costs. Only if this principle, repeatedly put forward by the German Government, is applied can the Commission conclude that the measures do not constitute an advantage to the parties that is relevant from the aid point of view. Allowing incentive payments would be at odds with this system. First, the German Government was unable to give a proper account of what the investors were actually providing, either in terms of quality or quantity. The Commission therefore held that the investors were not providing something to warrant payment of a consideration in return. On the contrary, the state funding constitutes a one-sided payment from the public purse. This is an essential feature of aid. Secondly, the incentive payment represents an economic advantage for investors that is not admissible as aid since, unlike in the Dow case, Linde and Caproleuna are not making a substantial contribution to the scheme as a whole.\nThe Commission accordingly concludes that the incentive payment cannot be accepted.\nThe conclusion on point 3 overall is that the DEM 700 million intended for investment and restructuring does not constitute aid. To ensure that this remains so, certain conditions and requirements have to be fulfilled.\n4. Working capital\nThe BvS is placing DEM 30 million at InfraLeuna's disposal as working capital during the restructuring phase. Evidence of the uses to which the working capital is put must be furnished quarterly in the form of documents on the basis of which the BvS can verify the amount of and need for any expenditure. As long as InfraLeuna is able to cover expenditure using its own income, public funds ought not to be disbursed.\nThe Commission has reservations in principle about making working capital available, as the reduction in costs may lead to an advantage being conferred and hence to a distortion of competition within the Community.\nIn the Commission's opinion, however, providing working capital should be assessed in exactly the same way as covering investment and restructuring costs from the public purse. Consequently InfraLeuna cannot be regarded as being favoured, as it cannot use the resources to its own advantage but must employ them for the company objects as referred to above. Final consumers are not favoured either, as the costs paid with the help of the working capital provided are to be included in calculating prices, with the result that no price reduction is possible. Similarly, there is no possibility of InfraLeuna's members being favoured, since the abovementioned control mechanisms, where appropriate in the form which the Commission considers necessary, are sufficient to prevent the funds from being used for purposes other than those for which they were intended.\nThe conclusion therefore has to be that the DEM 30 million working capital for InfraLeuna does not constitute aid.\n5. Loss compensation\nInfraLeuna is a complicated structure, founded on a balance between various interests and designed to rule out any favouring of or discrimination against individual participants. The Commission welcomes the scheme and takes a basically favourable view of it. Nevertheless, despite the balanced control system, there remains a risk that freely available loss compensation might be misused to subsidise prices. In the Commission's opinion the scheme can be viewed favourably as a whole only if price subsidisation is definitively ruled out by prohibiting loss compensation. As the Commission sees it, compensation for losses is not even necessary. The German Government stated that loss compensation was agreed on mainly for safety, to cover various individual risks whose occurrence and extent could not be foreseen when the contract was concluded. The Commission cannot agree to such \"precautionary\" cover, and the actual figures show that the risks have not materialised.\nThe Commission's conclusion has to be that loss compensation cannot be authorised. Should it prove necessary, it must be notified separately to the Commission and approved by it.\n6. The particular concerns of third parties\nThe Commission finds that the objections raised by third parties are unfounded. The vast majority of the measures constitute not aid, but indirect support for individual firms, so the possibility of reducing production costs and improving competitiveness can be ruled out. A capacity reduction under the Community code on aid to the synthetic fibres industry is accordingly not necessary.\nIn addition, almost all the services offered are geographically limited infrastructure services. Misuse of the resources made available and overstating of individual cost factors are ruled out by the wide-ranging system of checks. InfraLeuna's plan of advertising the site using firms on the site and naming them in the advertisements is unobjectionable in the Commission's opinion, provided that the firms bear a reasonable share of the cost. As costs are shared 50/50 by InfraLeuna and the firm concerned, this condition is met.\nThe Commission dismisses concerns that competitors of Caproleuna and Linde will be prevented from establishing themselves in the area. In the new Länder, and especially in the Land of Saxony-Anhalt, there is an overabundance of industrial sites just waiting to be bought, where competitors can set up in business on the same terms as Caproleuna and Linde.\nAs regards establishment in Leuna itself and possible participation in InfraLeuna as a member, the Commission would point out that the privatisation contract provides for protection against competitors. Under paragraph 6(2) of the contract, members are entitled to object if the BvS exercises its option of selling plots to direct competitors of InfraLeuna or of the other members. Paragraph 3(4) of the contract stipulates that a direct competitor of a member may purchase shares in InfraLeuna only with the express consent of all members. This is important from the point of view of the BvS's call option (paragraph 3(5) of the contract), which obliges Caproleuna and Linde each to sell 1 % of their shares to an investor of the BvS's choice.\nThe Commission would point out in this connection that a general need to obtain permission for the admission of new members into a private limited company is normal in company law. In addition, however, all but 4 % of the shares are already earmarked for sale, so the protection against competitors in paragraph 3(4) is scarcely relevant. Since it is so commonplace, the Commission therefore considers the clause unobjectionable.\nWhen it comes to the right of objection under paragraph 6(2) of the contract, however, the Commission takes a different view. A general exclusion of competitors such as this clause seems to allow cannot be justified. On the contrary, in view of the balanced nature of the interests concerned and the principle of non-discrimination to which InfraLeuna is committed, such a blanket exclusion would be incompatible with the overall scheme.\n7. Conclusion\nOverall, the Commission views the scheme underlying InfraLeuna favourably. The public authorities faced a difficult task in privatising the chemical site. First, the existing conditions on the site had to be taken into account. Secondly, they had to keep pace with new developments, to satisfy the needs of the firms established on the site and to fulfil the obligations they had assumed in the course of privatisation. After years of trying to find a private investor for the infrastructure, the scheme which the Treuhand/BvS has come up with seems, in the Commission's view, to be the best solution. It allows the public authorities to fulfil their obligation to privatise undertakings in the new Länder and bring the task to completion.\nThe investigations have shown that the planned measures do not confer an advantage on any of the parties involved so long as the conditions imposed by the Commission are adhered to. The measures contribute to InfraLeuna's viability, and a balanced cash-flow will be achieved during the period following completion of the restructuring phase, with the result that the financing of InfraLeuna can be regarded as assured in the long term.\nThe Commission further notes that the cost of investment and restructuring measures may need to be increased. Should the implementation of additional measures prove necessary or should the cost of investment and restructuring measures increase owing to external factors, up to DEM 100 million of the amount earmarked for site clearance may be used for investment or restructuring. The resources may be reallocated, however, only with the agreement of the BvS, which must assess whether the measures are necessary and appropriate. Any further transfer between budgets is ruled out,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\nArticle 1\nTABLE\nArticle 2\nAn unquantifiable part of the costs for rectifying environmental damage totalling DEM 150 million constitutes aid within the meaning of Article 92(1) of the EC Treaty; it is, however, compatible with the common market. The remaining part does not constitute aid.\nArticle 3\nGermany shall ensure that all services set up and offered by InfraLeuna are made available, against an appropriate charge, to all on-site producers without exception, on a non-discriminatory basis.\nArticle 4\nGermany shall ensure that the privatisation contract between InfraLeuna, Linde AG, Caproleuna GmbH and the Bundesanstalt für vereinigungsbedingte Sonderaufgaben (hereinafter \"BvS\") and the articles of association of InfraLeuna are amended as specified below:\n1. The privatisation contract, and in particular paragraph 12 thereof, shall be amended to exclude the assumption of loss compensation by the BvS amounting to DEM 50 million.\n2. The privatisation contract, and in particular paragraph 3 thereof, shall be amended so as to state that for the duration of the restructuring (until 31 December 2000) the BvS shall hold at least 1 % of the shares in InfraLeuna.\n3. The privatisation contract shall be further amended in such a way that for the duration of the restructuring and for a period of 15 years thereafter, none of the members may hold more than 24,5 % of the shares. Germany shall ensure that the shareholdings of Caproleuna GmbH and Linde AG are reduced to 24,5 % in each case. In the second sentence of paragraph 3(5), the words \"at the end of the restructuring phase\" shall be deleted in order that the BvS may exercise its call option at any time. The first sentence of Article 3(3) shall be amended so as to state that no purchaser may acquire more than 24,5 % of InfraLeuna's capital.\n4. The \"goodwill\" clause in paragraph 11(3) of the privatisation contract shall be deleted.\n5. The privatisation contract, and in particular paragraph 11(3)(b) thereof, shall be amended in such a way that, of the amount made available by the BvS for site clearance, InfraLeuna may use up to a maximum of DEM 100 million for investment and restructuring, provided always that the implementation of additional investment and restructuring measures proves necessary or that the cost of investment and restructuring measures increases owing to external factors. The resources may be so reallocated, however, only with the agreement of the BvS. The BvS shall examine the necessity and suitability of the measures in cooperation with an independent expert. Any further transfer shall be ruled out.\n6. The third subparagraph of paragraph 14(4) of the privatisation contract shall be deleted.\n7. In the second sentence of paragraph 6(2) of the privatisation contract, the words \"or to direct competitors of InfraLeuna\" shall be deleted.\n8. Paragraph 15(2) of the privatisation contract shall be amended in such a way that InfraLeuna is obliged to run the facilities for at least 15 years after completion of the restructuring (31 December 2000).\n9. Article 11 of InfraLeuna's articles of association shall be amended in such a way that Article 6(5)(a) of those articles may be amended or deleted only by a unanimous resolution. In Article 6(5)(a) of InfraLeuna's articles of association, the words \"where the total value of the contract exceeds DEM 1 million a year or DEM 5 million over the contract's lifetime\" shall be deleted.\n10. InfraLeuna's articles of association shall be amended in such a way that InfraLeuna's commitment to the low-profit principle, the ban on discrimination (Article3) and the prohibition on the distribution of dividends (Article 13(4)) shall remain unchanged for at least 15 years after completion of the restructuring.\nArticle 5\nGermany shall ensure that any purchaser of shares in InfraLeuna pays the market price. The market value of the shares shall be assessed by an independent expert. The valuation shall be based on InfraLeuna's capitalised value over 15 years and non-distributed profits. If necessary, the privatisation contract as well as the articles of association shall be amended accordingly. If the market value of the shares turns out to be higher than their nominal value, Germany shall ensure that Caproleuna GmbH and Linde AG will pay the corresponding difference to the BvS.\nArticle 6\n1. Germany shall send the Commission a copy of the amended contract within one month of its being concluded.\n2. Pursuant to Article 93(3) of the EC Treaty, Germany shall give notice of any deviations from the amended contract and any tax or other advantages granted.\nArticle 7\n1. Germany shall submit to the Commission half-yearly reports on the progress of restructuring and the amount of aid actually awarded under the various items in the privatisation contract, so as to allow it to verify that this Decision is being complied with. They shall be submitted during the first half of the year following the reporting period.\n2. Germany shall also submit to the Commission the evidence referred to in paragraphs 10(3) and 11(3) of the privatisation contract, the evidence referred to in paragraph 14(3), and quarterly investment reports which shall be checked in advance by an independent expert as to the necessity and appropriateness of the costs. The final statement referred to in paragraph 14(4) shall also be submitted to the Commission.\nArticle 8\nGermany shall refrain from granting any further funds to InfraLeuna in support of the restructuring plan which is the subject of this Decision.\nArticle 9\nGermany shall inform the Commission within two months of the date of notification of this Decision of the measures which it has taken to comply therewith.\nArticle 10\nThis Decision is addressed to the Federal Republic of Germany.\nDone at Brussels, 25 November 1998.",

whereas in its decision on the 1998 budget, the European Parliament in agreement with the Council created a new heading B5-5 (Labour market and technological innovation) for the financing with ECU 450 million over three years (1998 to 2000) of SMEs and of innovative actions and projects in the labour market; whereas, within this, ECU 30 million has been allocated in 1998 for innovative actions and projects in the labour market; whereas the European Council invited the Commission to make proposals, as soon as possible, for new financial instruments to support innovative and job-creating SMEs, as part of this initiative, so that the Council can adopt them speedily; whereas these new instruments must reinforce the European Technology Facility, financed by the European Investment Bank and administered by the European Investment Fund, by opening a 'risk capital window`, supporting the creation of transnational joint ventures between SMEs within the European Union and establishing within the European Investment Fund a special guarantee fund to facilitate risk-taking by institutions providing finance for small and medium-sized enterprises;\n(3) Whereas the EIB and EIF have already responded by creating the European Technology Facility (ETF), which will provide venture-capital for technology oriented SMEs by using established venture-capital funds as intermediaries;\n(4) Whereas, on 9 December 1996, the Council adopted Decision 97/15/EC on a third multiannual programme for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in the European Union (1997 to 2000) (5); whereas this programme includes the objectives of improving access to loan and risk capital financing, facilitating the development of specific financial instruments and stimulating the development of capital markets for fast-growing SMEs;\n(5) Whereas, on 5 November 1997, the Commission adopted Decision 97/761/EC approving a support mechanism for the creation of transnational joint ventures for SMEs in the Community (6), a financially limited initiative launched under the third multiannual programme for SMEs;\n(6) Whereas, on 15 December 1994, the Council adopted Decision 94/917/EC, adopting a specific programme for the dissemination and optimisation of the results of activities in the field of research and technological development, including demonstration (1994 to 1998) (7) which provides for activities to improve the European environment for financing the exploitation, adaptation and dissemination of technology by appropriate Community schemes; whereas the Commission on 25 November 1996 adopted a communication on the 'First action plan for innovation in Europe - innovation for growth and employment` providing for innovation financing to be facilitated in Europe, especially by encouraging investment in risk capital and equity, particularly in start-up investment and innovative, high-growth firms which are a major source of new jobs, and by reinforcing European Investment Fund action in favour of innovation; whereas this Decision should be implemented in appropriate coordination with the abovementioned activities;\n(7) Whereas in the implementation on the financial assistance programme for SMEs under this programme, particular attention should be given to small enterprises with up to 100 employees, within the objectives of the programme;\n(8) Whereas the lack of venture capital constitutes a particular difficulty for new firms and SMEs looking to expand, especially those exploiting new technology and innovative ideas; whereas this segment of the venture-capital market is underdeveloped in Europe and entails the highest risks which potentially translate to high losses; whereas a determined public sector involvement will assist private sector operators to make onward investments to early stage and emerging SMEs;\n(9) Whereas SMEs frequently encounter difficulties in obtaining bank financing for the development of transnational joint ventures because of the higher risk for financial institutions; whereas the development of joint ventures between Community SMEs makes it possible to make better use of the opportunities of the internal market, to increase investment and trade and to have a positive effect on employment and economic growth; whereas advances and subsidies constitute the most suitable measure to overcome the financial obstacles for SMEs to create transnational joint ventures;\n(10) Whereas bank loans constitute an important source of external funding for SMEs; whereas the raising of debt finance is difficult for SMEs as banks are often reluctant to lend to them; whereas loans are often only available to SMEs against tangible security; whereas loan guarantees constitute a cost-effective instrument to facilitate access to loans; whereas both tangible and intangible investments should be eligible under the scheme; and whereas a significant leverage effect can be achieved with a guarantee instrument;\n(11) Whereas this Decision constitutes the legal basis for specific measures which are complementary with other Community measures and which cannot be better carried out at Member State level and therefore respect the principle of subsidiarity; whereas the Decision is limited to the minimum necessary to achieve its objectives and does not exceed what is necessary to this end and therefore respects the principle of proportionality;\n(12) Whereas the Commission should adapt the allocation to the different schemes over the three-year period to take account of their absorption and efficiency in terms of the quality of the prospects submitted, their impact on the access to financing by SMEs and their immediate and long term impact on creating sustainable jobs;\n(13) Whereas the definition of SMEs as set out in Commission Recommendation 96/280/EC of 3 April 1996 concerning the definition of small and medium-sized enterprises (8) should be applied in the implementation of this Decision;\n(14) Whereas the EIF was set up in June 1994 to contribute to the pursuit of Community objectives by stimulating investment in trans-European networks and small and medium-sized enterprises;

whereas those measures, if they have effected on beneficiary SMEs comparable to those arising from State aid, have to observe the limits and conditions laid down for the compatibility of comparable State aid,\nHAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:\nArticle 1\nObjective of the programme\nA programme of financial assistance for innovatory and job-creating small and medium-sized enterprises is hereby set up with the aim of stimulating job-creation by facilitating and strengthening the establishment and growth of innovative SMEs (hereinafter 'the programme`) as defined in Commission Recommendation 96/280/EC, by supporting their investment activity through increased availability of finance. The programme shall be targeted at SMEs with growth and therefore employment creation potential.\nArticle 2\nDescription of the programme\nThe programme shall consist of three complementary facilities which shall be: a risk-capital scheme (ETF Start-up) managed by the European Investment Fund (EIF), a scheme for financial contributions supporting the creation of transnational joint-ventures by SMEs within the Community (Joint European Venture) managed by the Commission and a guarantee scheme (SME Guarantee Facility) managed by the EIF.\nArticle 3\nThe ETF start-up facility\n1. The Community shall provide risk-capital participation in SMEs primarily at their establishment and early stages and/or innovative SMEs through investments in relevant specialised venture-capital funds, where appropriate in cooperation with other participatory mechanisms established in Member States, particularly in smaller or newly established funds, funds operating regionally or funds focused on specific industries or technologies, or venture-capital funds financing the exploitation of R& D results, e.g. funds linked to research centres and science parks, avoiding duplication of existing EIB and EIF interventions and reduction of the risk on these instruments.\n2. The EIF shall select, make and manage the investments into the venture-capital funds, where appropriate working with national schemes. The detailed terms and conditions for implementing the ETF start-up facility, including its monitoring and control, shall be laid down in a cooperation agreement between the Commission and the EIF.\n3. The cooperation agreement shall take account of the indicative outline set out in Annex I.\nArticle 4\nJoint European Venture (JEV)\n1. The Community shall provide financial contributions to SMEs for the setting-up of new transnational joint ventures within the European Union. The Community contribution is intended to cover a part of the expenses incurred in the conception and setting-up of transnational joint ventures. The maximum contribution per project shall be ECU 100 000 covering:\n(a) up to 50 % of the eligible expenses, with a maximum of ECU 50 000;\n(b) up to 10 % of the total amount of investment made in fixed assets. Particular attention shall be given to small enterprises with up to 100 employees.\n2. Eligible expenses for the purposes of point (a) of paragraph 1 shall be those essential expenses related to the conception and setting-up of a transnational joint venture defined in point 6 of Annex II and created by European SMEs.\n3. Applications for contributions shall be channelled to the Commission through a network of finance intermediaries. In the implementation of the JEV, the indicative outline set out in Annex II shall be taken into account.\nArticle 5\nThe SME guarantee facility\n1. The Community shall provide budgetary allocations for the purpose of covering the cost of guarantees and counter-guarantees issued by the EIF in order to promote an increase of loans to SMEs, by increasing the capacity of guarantee schemes operating in the Member States in the public or private sector, including mutual guarantee schemes; the scheme may also support any risk-sharing SME instruments the EIB or any other appropriate financial institutions may make available. Appropriate cooperation with Member States will be ensured by contacts between the EIF and national authorities before implementing the facility.\n2. The budgetary allocation shall cover the full cost of the facility, including EIF's guarantee losses and any other eligible costs or expenses of the facility. The cost of the facility to the Community budget shall be capped so that it does not under any circumstances exceed the budgetary allocations made available to the EIF under this action; there shall be no contingent liability on the Community budget.\n3. Priority shall be given to small enterprises with up to 100 employees. The guarantees issued by the EIF shall be partial guarantees; there shall always be a risk-sharing arrangement between the EIF and the financial intermediary. Whenever possible, in the implementation of this instrument, the EIF will work guarantee schemes set up primarily to help finance loans that the banking system would not readily provide without guarantee cover and to ensure that part of the risk is borne by the lender.\n4. The detailed terms and conditions for implementing the SME guarantee facility, including its monitoring and control, shall be laid down in a cooperation agreement between the Commission and the EIF.\n5. The cooperation agreement shall take into account the indicative outline set out in Annex III.\nArticle 6\nManagement fees\nThe management fees paid to the EIF shall be determined in accordance with the accepted market practice and may be debited to the appropriations devoted to the initiative.\nArticle 7\nReporting and evaluation\n1. The Commission shall report annually to the European Parliament and the Council on the implementation of this Decision and the different schemes under it, notably on this Decision's impact on the access to financing by SMEs, its immediate effects on the creation of employment, the prospects for the creation of employment in the long term and coherence between the financial allocation to the different schemes and the objectives of the programme.\n2. The Commission shall within 48 months at most from the date of its adoption, provide an evaluation of the programme, notably as regards its overall utilisation, its immediate effects on the creation of employment and the prospects for the creation of employment in the long term.\nArticle 8\nFinal provision\nWithout prejudice to what is indicated in Annex I, point 5, Annex II, point 4 and Annex III, point 10, this programme shall come to an end on 31 December 2000.\nArticle 9\nThis Decision shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities. It shall take effect on the day of its publication.\nDone at Brussels, 19 May 1998.",

The conditions for granting flat-rate aid should therefore be established on that basis and Commission Regulation (EEC) No 4176/88 of 28 December 1988 laying down detailed rules of application for the granting of flat-rate aid for certain fisheries products(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 3516/93(6), should be repealed.\n(3) Article 6(1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 2406/96 of 26 November 1996 laying down common marketing standards for certain fishery products(7), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2578/2000(8), provides that products that are classified as category B are ineligible for the financial assistance granted in respect of withdrawal as provided for in the common market organisation. Given that only Extra, \"E\" and \"A\" quality products are eligible for the flat-rate aid described in Article 24 of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000, the calculation of the quantities eligible for this aid should be based on these categories of products only.\n(4) The conditions to be satisfied by producer organisations in the context of the flat-rate aid scheme should be determined.\n(5) The flat-rate aid may be paid only at the end of the fishing year. However, provision should be made for the possibility of granting advances subject to the lodging of a security.\n(6) The Member States should be authorised to fix the standard value used in calculating the flat-rate aid broken down according to the destination of the products withdrawn as provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1501/83 of 9 June 1983 on the disposal of certain fishery products which have been the subject of measures to stabilise the market(9), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1106/90(10).\n(7) In order to help guarantee product quality and the disposal of these products on the market, the minimum conditions applicable to processing, and the conditions relating to storage and the re-release onto the market of the processed products should be determined.\n(8) The recipients of aid should keep a stock record containing the figures for releases onto the market, withdrawals from the market and amounts carried over each month (in kilograms) to increase the efficiency of checks and should supply this information to the Member State. It is sufficient for the purposes of good management of the mechanism to require stock records during the minimum storage periods.\n(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Fishery Products,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I\nGeneral provisions\nArticle 1\nTo qualify for flat-rate aid, producer organisations shall send the competent authorities in the Member State the list of products broken down by category and the autonomous withdrawal price referred to in Article 24(1) of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 before the start of the fishing year.\nProducer organisations may apply an autonomous withdrawal price exceeding the maximum level referred to in Article 24(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 for one or more product categories. However, they shall lose the right to flat-rate aid for the category or categories for which the maximum level is exceeded.\nArticle 2\nFlat-rate aid shall be paid to the producer organisation concerned only once the competent authorities in the Member State in question have satisfied themselves that the quantities in respect of which the aid is applied for do not exceed the limit given in Article 24(5) of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000.\nCHAPTER II\nConditions for granting the flat-rate aid referred to in Article 24(2) of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 (hereinafter referred to as \"flat-rate compensation\")\nArticle 3\nThe requirements set out in Articles 1 to 4 and Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 2509/2000 shall apply mutatis mutandis to the grant of flat-rate compensation.\nArticle 4\nThe Member States shall fix the standard value to be used in calculating the flat-rate compensation and the advances relating thereto, broken down according to the destination of the products withdrawn as referred to in Article 1(b), (c), and (d) of Regulation (EEC) No 1501/83.\nThe standard value shall be fixed at the beginning of the fishing year and shall be identical for all the producer organisations recognised by the Member State concerned, using as a basis the average receipts from disposal via the outlets for the Member States concerned over the six months preceding the fixing of that value. That level shall be amended if significant and lasting changes in receipts are noted on the market of the Member State concerned.\nCHAPTER III\nConditions for granting the flat-rate aid referred to in Article 24(4) of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 (hereinafter referred to as \"flat-rate premium\")\nArticle 5\n1. The amount of the flat-rate premium shall be fixed before the beginning of each fishing year in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 38(2) of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000. The amount shall be fixed per unit weight, to be applied to the net weight of each product listed in Annex IV to that Regulation.\n2. The amount of the flat-rate premium shall be calculated on the basis of the real technical and financial costs of operations required for the stabilisation and storage of the products in question as recorded in the Community during the previous fishing year.\n3. The following shall be considered as technical costs:\n(a) energy costs;\n(b) labour costs relating to storage and release from storage;\n(c) cost of materials for direct packaging;\n(d) processing costs (ingredients);\n(e) cost of transport from place of landing to place of processing.\n4. The financial costs shall be a flat-rate sum of EUR 10 per tonne for 2001. Thereafter the flat-rate sum shall be adjusted each year using the interest rate set annually in accordance with Article 5 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1883/78(11).\n5. The level of the flat-rate premium fixed for the fishing year concerned shall apply to products entering storage during that year, irrespective of the end of the storage period.\nArticle 6\nArticle 3(1) and (2) and Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 2814/2000 shall apply mutatis mutandis to the grant of the flat-rate premium.\nArticle 7\nThe flat-rate premium shall be paid to the producer organisation concerned only once the competent authorities in the Member State concerned have satisfied themselves that the quantities in respect of which the premium is applied for have been either processed and stored, or preserved, and subsequently placed back on the market, in accordance with Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 2814/2000.\nCHAPTER IV\nFinal provisions\nArticle 8\n1. Applications for payment of the flat-rate aid shall be submitted by the producer organisation concerned to the competent authorities of the Member State not later than four months after the end of the fishing year concerned. They shall include at least the information set out in the Annex.\n2. Advance payments shall be granted each month at the request of the producer organisation concerned for the quantities withdrawn or carried over, on condition that it lodges a security of at least 105 % of the amount advanced.\n3. The amount of the advance payment or payments shall be determined on the basis of the provisional ratio of the quantities withdrawn to the quantities put up for sale during the period concerned. The calculation of the amount shall be adjusted two months after the month concerned on the basis of the transactions actually carried out and reported using the model set out in the Annex.\n4. The national authorities shall pay the flat-rate aid within eight months of the end of the fishing year at the latest. Each Member State shall notify the other Member States and the Commission of the name and address of the body designated to pay the flat-rate aid.\nArticle 9\n1. The Member States shall introduce a system of checks to verify that the information given in applications for payment corresponds to the quantities actually put up for sale and withdrawn from the market by the producer organisation concerned.\n2.

This will contribute to the objective of preventing and fighting against illegal immigration and illegal residence. It must also be suited to use by all the Member States.\n(3)\nThe integration of biometric identifiers is an important step towards the use of new elements, which establish a more reliable link between the holder and the residence permit as an important contribution to ensuring that it is protected against fraudulent use. The specifications set out in the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) document No 9303 Part 3 on Size 1 and 2 machine readable official documents should be taken into account.\n(4)\nFurthermore, the vast majority of Member States apply the principle of one person one document, which enhances security even further. It should be examined whether this principle should be rendered mandatory.\n(5)\nAt its meeting in Thessaloniki on 19 and 20 June 2003, the European Council stressed that a coherent approach was needed in the EU on biometric identifiers or biometric data, which would result in harmonised solutions for documents for third country nationals, EU citizens’ passports and information systems.\n(6)\nThe use of new technologies such as e-government and digital signature for access to e-services should be facilitated by giving Member States the possibility to use the storage medium used for the incorporation of biometric identifiers or an additional storage medium for that purpose in residence permits.\n(7)\nThe purpose of this Regulation is solely to set the security features and biometric identifiers to be used by the Member States in a uniform format of residence permit for third-country nationals.\n(8)\nThis Regulation only lays down specifications that are not secret; these specifications need to be supplemented by further specifications which may remain secret in order to prevent counterfeiting and falsifications and which may not include personal data or references to such data. Powers to adopt such supplementary specifications should be conferred on the Commission, which should be assisted by the Committee established by Article 6 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1683/95 of 29 May 1995 laying down a uniform format for visas (2).\n(9)\nWith regard to the personal data to be processed in the context of the uniform format for residence permits, Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (3) applies. It must be ensured that no further information is stored on the uniform format for residence permits unless provided for in Council Regulation (EC) No 1030/2002 (4), its Annex or unless it is mentioned in the relevant travel document.\n(10)\nIn accordance with the principle of proportionality, it is necessary and appropriate for the achievement of the basic objective of introducing biometric identifiers in interoperable formats to lay down rules for all Member States implementing the Schengen Convention. This Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve the objectives pursued in accordance with the third paragraph of Article 5 of the Treaty.\n(11)\nIn accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on the position of Denmark, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark does not take part in the adoption of this Regulation, and is therefore not bound by it or subject to its application. Given that this Regulation builds upon the Schengen acquis under the provisions of Title IV of Part Three of the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark should, in accordance with Article 5 of that Protocol, decide within a period of six months after the adoption of this Regulation, whether it will implement it in its national law.\n(12)\nAs regards Iceland and Norway, this Regulation constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Agreement concluded by the Council of the European Union and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway concerning the association of those two States with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis (5) which fall within the area referred to in Article 1, point C of Council Decision 1999/437/EC (6) on certain arrangements for the application of that Agreement.\n(13)\nIn accordance with Article 3 of the Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, the United Kingdom gave notice, by letter of 29 December 2003, of its wish to take part in the adoption and application of this Regulation.\n(14)\nIn accordance with Article 3 of the Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Ireland gave notice, by letter of 19 December 2003, of its wish to take part in the adoption and application of this Regulation.\n(15)\nAs regards Switzerland, this Regulation constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Agreement signed by the European Union, the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on the latter's association with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis which fall within the area referred to in Article 1, point C of Decision 1999/437/EC read in conjunction with Article 4(1) of Council Decision 2004/860/EC (7),\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nRegulation (EC) No 1030/2002 is hereby amended as follows:\n1.\nArticle 1 shall be amended as follows:\n(a)\nin paragraph 1, the second sentence shall be replaced by the following:\n‘Residence permits to third-country nationals shall be issued as stand-alone documents in ID 1 or ID 2 format.’;\n(b)\nparagraph 2(a) shall be amended as follows:\n(i)\npoint (ii) shall be replaced by the following:\n‘(ii)\npermits issued pending examination of a request for asylum, an application for a residence permit or an application for its extension;’;\n(ii)\nthe following point shall be inserted:\n‘(iia)\npermits issued in exceptional circumstances with a view to an extension of the authorised stay with a maximum duration of one month;’;\n2.\nthe following points shall be added to Article 2(1):\n‘(d)\ntechnical specifications for the storage medium of the biometric features and the security thereof, including prevention of unauthorised access;\n(e)\nrequirements for the quality of and common standards for the facial image and the fingerprint images;\n(f)\nan exhaustive list of additional national security features which could be added by Member States in accordance with point (h) of the Annex.’;\n3.\nin Article 3, the first paragraph shall be replaced by the following:\n‘In accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 7(2), it may be decided that the specifications referred to in Article 2 shall be secret and not be published.

Since 2002, the first code has been split into CN codes 2710 19 41, 2710 19 45 and 2710 19 49, in order to take into account the sulphur content of gas oil, and the second code has been transposed as CN code 2710 19 25.\n(2)\nCommission Decision 2001/574/EC (2) established the product identified by the scientific name N-ethyl-N-[2-(1-isobutoxyethoxy)ethyl]-4-(phenylazo)aniline (Solvent Yellow 124) as the common fiscal marker provided for by Directive 95/60/EC, for the marking of gas oils and kerosene which have not borne duty at the full rate applicable to such mineral oils used as propellant.\n(3)\nArticle 2 of Decision 2001/574/EC requires that the Decision be reviewed by 31 December 2006 at the latest, in the light of technical developments in the field of marking systems and taking into account the need to counteract fraudulent use of mineral oils exempt from excise duty, or subject to a reduced excise duty rate.\n(4)\nAs part of the review process a consultation of the Member States was undertaken. Member States are generally satisfied that Solvent Yellow 124 has met its objectives of counteracting fraudulent use of mineral oils exempt from excise duty, or subject to a reduced excise duty rate.\n(5)\nNo problems have been reported with regard to the health and environmental effects of the use of Solvent Yellow 124.\n(6)\nNo alternative product, as a potential replacement for Solvent Yellow 124, meeting all the criteria under which Solvent Yellow 124 was selected as the common fiscal marker, has been presented or supported so far with the relevant scientific information.\n(7)\nConsequently, Solvent Yellow 124 should continue to be used as the common fiscal marker within the meaning of Directive 95/60/EC and subject to the conditions set out in that Directive.\n(8)\nThis Decision does not release any undertaking from its obligations under Article 82 of the Treaty.\n(9)\nThe opportunities offered by future developments in science should be taken into account by setting a time limit for the review of this Decision.\n(10)\nHowever, a review of this Decision should be undertaken at any time prior to this time limit if Solvent Yellow 124 is found to be causing additional health or environmental damage.\n(11)\nIn the interests of clarity and transparency Decision 2001/574/EC should be replaced.\n(12)\nThe measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on Excise Duties,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\nArticle 1\nThe common fiscal marker provided for by Directive 95/60/EC, for the marking of all gas oils falling within CN codes 2710 19 41, 2710 19 45, and 2710 19 49, as well as of kerosene falling within CN code 2710 19 25, shall be Solvent Yellow 124, as specified in the Annex to this Decision.\nMember States shall fix a marking level of at least 6 mg and not more than 9 mg of marker per litre of mineral oil.\nArticle 2\nThis Decision shall be reviewed by 31 December 2011 at the latest, taking into account technical developments in the field of marking systems and the need to counteract fraudulent use of mineral oils exempt from excise duty or subject to a reduced excise duty rate.\nAn earlier review shall be undertaken if it is found that Solvent Yellow 124 is causing additional health or environmental damage.\nArticle 3\nDecision 2001/574/EC is repealed.\nArticle 4\nThis Decision is addressed to the Member States.\nDone at Brussels, 22 June 2006.",

However, it is anticipated that the scope of this Directive will be extended to cover biocidal products.\n(3)\nThe measures provided for in this Directive should be complementary to, and not affect, measures laid down in other related Community legislation, in particular Council Directive 79/409/EEC of 2 April 1979 on the conservation of wild birds (5), Council Directive 92/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora (6), Directive 2000/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2000 establishing a framework for Community action in the field of water policy (7), Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 February 2005 on maximum residue levels of pesticides in or on food and feed of plant and animal origin (8) and Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 October 2009 on the placing of plant protection products on the market (9). These measures should also not prejudice voluntary measures in the context of Regulations for Structural Funds or of Council Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 of 20 September 2005 on support for rural development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) (10).\n(4)\nEconomic instruments can play a crucial role in the achievement of objectives relating to the sustainable use of pesticides. The use of such instruments at the appropriate level should therefore be encouraged while stressing that individual Member States can decide on their use without prejudice to the applicability of the State aid rules.\n(5)\nNational Action Plans aimed at setting quantitative objectives, targets, measures, timetables and indicators to reduce risks and impacts of pesticide use on human health and the environment and at encouraging the development and introduction of integrated pest management and of alternative approaches or techniques in order to reduce dependency on the use of pesticides should be used by Member States in order to facilitate the implementation of this Directive. Member States should monitor the use of plant protection products containing active substances of particular concern and establish timetables and targets for the reduction of their use, in particular when it is an appropriate means to achieve risk reduction targets. National Action Plans should be coordinated with implementation plans under other relevant Community legislation and could be used for grouping together objectives to be achieved under other Community legislation related to pesticides.\n(6)\nThe exchange of information on the objectives and actions Member States lay down in their National Action Plans is a very important element for achieving the objectives of this Directive. Therefore, it is appropriate to request Member States to report regularly to the Commission and to the other Member States, in particular on the implementation and results of their National Action Plans and on their experiences. On the basis of information transmitted by the Member States, the Commission should submit relevant reports to the European Parliament and to the Council, accompanied, if necessary, by appropriate legislative proposals.\n(7)\nFor the preparation and modification of National Action Plans, it is appropriate to provide for the application of Directive 2003/35/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 May 2003 providing for public participation in respect of the drawing up of certain plans and programmes relating to the environment (11).\n(8)\nIt is essential that Member States set up systems of both initial and additional training for distributors, advisors and professional users of pesticides and certification systems to record such training so that those who use or will use pesticides are fully aware of the potential risks to human health and the environment and of the appropriate measures to reduce those risks as much as possible. Training activities for professional users may be coordinated with those organised in the framework of Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005.\n(9)\nSales of pesticides, including Internet sales, are an important element in the distribution chain, where specific advice on safety instructions for human health and the environment should be given to the end user at the time of sale, in particular to professional users. For non-professional users who in general do not have the same level of education and training, recommendations should be given, in particular on safe handling and storage of pesticides as well as on disposal of the packaging.\n(10)\nConsidering the possible risks from the use of pesticides, the general public should be better informed of the overall impacts of the use of pesticides through awareness-raising campaigns, information passed on through retailers and other appropriate measures.\n(11)\nResearch programmes aimed at determining the impacts of pesticide use on human health and the environment, including studies on high-risk groups, should be promoted at European and national level.\n(12)\nTo the extent that the handling and application of pesticides require the setting of minimum health and safety requirements at the workplace, covering the risks arising from exposure of workers to such products, as well as general and specific preventive measures to reduce those risks, those measures are covered by Council Directive 98/24/EC of 7 April 1998 on the protection of the health and safety of workers from the risks related to chemical agents at work (12) and Directive 2004/37/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the protection of workers from the risks related to their exposure to carcinogens or mutagens at work (13).\n(13)\nSince Directive 2006/42/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 May 2006 on machinery (14) will provide for rules on the placing on the market of pesticide application equipment ensuring that environmental requirements are met, it is appropriate, in order to minimise the adverse impacts of pesticides on human health and the environment caused by such equipment, to provide for systems for regular technical inspection of pesticide application equipment already in use. Member States should describe in their National Action Plans how they will ensure the implementation of those requirements.\n(14)\nAerial spraying of pesticides has the potential to cause significant adverse impacts on human health and the environment, in particular from spray drift. Therefore, aerial spraying should generally be prohibited with derogations possible where it represents clear advantages in terms of reduced impacts on human health and the environment in comparison with other spraying methods, or where there are no viable alternatives, provided that the best available technology to reduce drift is used.\n(15)\nThe aquatic environment is especially sensitive to pesticides. It is therefore necessary for particular attention to be paid to avoiding pollution of surface water and groundwater by taking appropriate measures, such as the establishment of buffer and safeguard zones or planting hedges along surface waters to reduce exposure of water bodies to spray drift, drain flow and run-off. The dimensions of buffer zones should depend in particular on soil characteristics and pesticide properties, as well as agricultural characteristics of the areas concerned. Use of pesticides in areas for the abstraction of drinking water, on or along transport routes, such as railway lines, or on sealed or very permeable surfaces can lead to higher risks of pollution of the aquatic environment. In such areas the pesticide use should, therefore, be reduced as far as possible, or eliminated, if appropriate.\n(16)\nUse of pesticides can be particularly dangerous in very sensitive areas, such as Natura 2000 sites protected in accordance with Directives 79/409/EEC and 92/43/EEC. In other places such as public parks and gardens, sports and recreation grounds, school grounds and children’s playgrounds, and in the close vicinity of healthcare facilities, the risks from exposure to pesticides are high. In these areas, the use of pesticides should be minimised or prohibited. When pesticides are used, appropriate risk management measures should be established and low-risk pesticides as well as biological control measures should be considered in the first place.\n(17)\nHandling of pesticides, including storage, diluting and mixing the pesticides and cleaning of pesticide application equipment after use, and recovery and disposal of tank mixtures, empty packaging and remnants of pesticides are particularly prone to unwanted exposure of humans and the environment. Therefore, it is appropriate to provide for specific measures addressing those activities as a complement to the measures provided for under Directive 2006/12/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2006 on waste (15), and Council Directive 91/689/EEC of 12 December 1991 on hazardous waste (16). Measures should also encompass non-professional users, since inappropriate handling is very likely to occur in this group of users due to their lack of knowledge.\n(18)\nThe application of general principles and crop and sector-specific guidelines with respect to integrated pest management by all farmers would result in a better targeted use of all available pest control measures, including pesticides. Therefore, it would contribute to a further reduction of the risks to human health and the environment and the dependency on the use of pesticides. Member States should promote low pesticide-input pest management, in particular integrated pest management, and establish the necessary conditions and measures for its implementation.\n(19)\nOn the basis of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 and of this Directive, implementation of the principles of integrated pest management is obligatory and the subsidiarity principle applies to the way the principles for integrated pest management are implemented. Member States should describe in their National Action Plan how they ensure the implementation of the principles of integrated pest management, with priority given wherever possible to non-chemical methods of plant protection and pest and crop management.\n(20)\nIt is necessary to measure the progress achieved in the reduction of risks and adverse impacts from pesticide use for human health and the environment. Appropriate means are harmonised risk indicators that will be established at Community level. Member States should use those indicators for risk management at national level and for reporting purposes, while the Commission should calculate indicators to evaluate progress at Community level. Statistical data collected in accordance with the Community legislation concerning statistics on plant protection products should be used. Member States should be entitled to use, in addition to harmonised common indicators, their national indicators.\n(21)\nMember States should determine penalties applicable to infringements of national provisions adopted pursuant to this Directive and ensure that they are implemented. The penalties should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.\n(22)\nSince the objective of this Directive, namely to protect human health and the environment from possible risks associated with the use of pesticides, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.\n(23)\nThis Directive respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised notably by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. In particular, this Directive seeks to promote the integration into Community policies of a high level of environmental protection in accordance with the principle of sustainable development as laid down in Article 37 of that Charter.\n(24)\nThe measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (17).\n(25)\nIn particular, the Commission should be empowered to establish and update the Annexes to this Directive. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of this Directive, inter alia, by supplementing it with new non-essential elements, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.\n(26)\nIn accordance with point 34 of the Interinstitutional agreement on better law-making (18), Member States are encouraged to draw up, for themselves and in the interests of the Community, their own tables illustrating, as far as possible, the correlation between this Directive and the transposition measures, and to make them public,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nCHAPTER I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nSubject matter\nThis Directive establishes a framework to achieve a sustainable use of pesticides by reducing the risks and impacts of pesticide use on human health and the environment and promoting the use of integrated pest management and of alternative approaches or techniques such as non-chemical alternatives to pesticides.\nArticle 2\nScope\n1. This Directive shall apply to pesticides that are plant protection products as defined in point 10(a) of Article 3.\n2. This Directive shall apply without prejudice to any other relevant Community legislation.\n3. The provisions of this Directive shall not prevent Member States from applying the precautionary principle in restricting or prohibiting the use of pesticides in specific circumstances or areas.\nArticle 3\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Directive, the following definitions shall apply:\n1.\n‘professional user’ means any person who uses pesticides in the course of their professional activities, including operators, technicians, employers and self-employed people, both in the farming and other sectors;\n2.\n‘distributor’ means any natural or legal person who makes a pesticide available on the market, including wholesalers, retailers, vendors and suppliers;\n3.\n‘advisor’ means any person who has acquired adequate knowledge and advises on pest management and the safe use of pesticides, in the context of a professional capacity or commercial service, including private self-employed and public advisory services, commercial agents, food producers and retailers where applicable;\n4.\n‘pesticide application equipment’ means any apparatus specifically intended for the application of pesticides, including accessories that are essential for the effective operation of such equipment, such as nozzles, manometers, filters, strainers and cleaning devices for tanks;\n5.\n‘aerial spraying’ means application of pesticides from an aircraft (plane or helicopter);\n6.\n‘integrated pest management’ means careful consideration of all available plant protection methods and subsequent integration of appropriate measures that discourage the development of populations of harmful organisms and keep the use of plant protection products and other forms of intervention to levels that are economically and ecologically justified and reduce or minimise risks to human health and the environment. ‘Integrated pest management’ emphasises the growth of a healthy crop with the least possible disruption to agro-ecosystems and encourages natural pest control mechanisms;\n7.\n‘risk indicator’ means the result of a method of calculation that is used to evaluate risks of pesticides on human health and/or the environment;\n8.\n‘non-chemical methods’ means alternative methods to chemical pesticides for plant protection and pest management, based on agronomic techniques such as those referred to in point 1 of Annex III, or physical, mechanical or biological pest control methods;\n9.\nthe terms ‘surface water’ and ‘groundwater’ have the same meaning as in Directive 2000/60/EC;\n10.\n‘pesticide’ means:\n(a)\na plant protection product as defined in Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009;\n(b)\na biocidal product as defined in Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 1998 concerning the placing on the market of biocidal products (19).\nArticle 4\nNational Action Plans\n1. Member States shall adopt National Action Plans to set up their quantitative objectives, targets, measures and timetables to reduce risks and impacts of pesticide use on human health and the environment and to encourage the development and introduction of integrated pest management and of alternative approaches or techniques in order to reduce dependency on the use of pesticides. These targets may cover different areas of concern, for example worker protection, protection of the environment, residues, use of specific techniques or use in specific crops.\nThe National Action Plans shall also include indicators to monitor the use of plant protection products containing active substances of particular concern, especially if alternatives are available. Member States shall give particular attention to the plant protection products containing active substances approved in accordance with Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant products on the market (20) which, when subject to renewal of approval under Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 will not fulfil the criteria relevant for approval laid down in Annex II, points 3.6 to 3.8 of that Regulation.\nOn the basis of such indicators and taking into account where applicable the risk or use reduction targets achieved already prior to the application of this Directive, timetables and targets for the reduction of use shall also be established, in particular if the reduction of use constitutes an appropriate means to achieve risk reduction with regard to priority items identified under Article 15(2)(c). These targets may be intermediate or final. Member States shall use all necessary means designed to achieve these targets.\nWhen drawing up and revising their National Action Plans, Member States shall take account of the health, social, economic and environmental impacts of the measures envisaged, of specific national, regional and local conditions and all relevant stakeholder groups. Member States shall describe in their National Action Plans how they will implement measures pursuant to Articles 5 to 15 in order to achieve the objectives referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph.\nThe National Action Plans shall take into account plans under other Community legislation on the use of pesticides, such as planned measures under Directive 2000/60/EC.\n2. By 14 December 2012, Member States shall communicate their National Action Plans to the Commission and to other Member States.\nNational Action Plans shall be reviewed at least every five years and any substantial changes to National Action Plans shall be reported to the Commission without undue delay.\n3. By 14 December 2014, the Commission shall submit to the European Parliament and to the Council a report on the information communicated by the Member States in relation to the National Action Plans. The report shall contain methods used and the implications concerning the establishment of different types of targets to reduce the risks and use of pesticides.\nBy 14 December 2018, the Commission shall submit to the European Parliament and to the Council a report on the experience gained by Member States on the implementation of national targets established in accordance with paragraph 1 in order to achieve the objectives of this Directive.

PROCEDURE\n(1)\nBy letter S(2002)4231 of 11 April 2002, registered under No NN/110/02, the Commission was informed that the Kingdom of Spain had implemented aid for the airline Intermediación Aérea SL (hereinafter referred to as Intermed) for the provision of air transport services on the Gerona-Madrid-Gerona route. By letter of 23 May 2002, the Commission asked the Spanish authorities for all relevant information. The latter replied by letter of 1 July 2002, registered on 5 July 2002.\n(2)\nBy letter of 13 December 2002, the Commission informed the Kingdom of Spain of its decision to initiate the procedure provided for in Article 88(2) of the EC Treaty with regard to this aid.\n(3)\nThe Commission decision to initiate the procedure was published in the Official Journal of the European Union (2). The Commission called on the parties concerned to submit their comments on the aid.\n(4)\nBy letter of 9 January 2003 from the Permanent Representation of Spain to the European Union, the Spanish authorities asked for further time to reply to the letter of 13 December 2003. By letter TREN/A4(2003)838 of 20 January 2003, the Commission granted an additional period of 15 working days.\n(5)\nThe Spanish authorities sent their comments by letter of 18 March 2003, reference A24-3996, registered by the Secretariat-General of the Commission on 19 March 2003.\n(6)\nThe Commission received comments on this subject from parties concerned. It forwarded them to the Kingdom of Spain by letters of 13 March and 2 April 2003, allowing it an opportunity to comment on them, and received its comments by letter of 7 May 2003.\nII. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE AID\n(7)\nAccording to the information in the Commission’s possession, the measures provided for by the Spanish authorities appear in the Contract relating to air routes serving the cities of Gerona and Madrid concluded on 26 March 2002 between the Generalitat de Catalunya (Autonomous Government of Catalonia), the Diputación de Girona (Gerona Regional Council), the Gerona Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the representative of Intermed (hereinafter referred to as the contract).\n(8)\nThe aid is intended to promote the development of competitive, high-quality air transport on the Gerona-Madrid-Gerona route through the use of aircraft which meet appropriate conditions of comfort and reliability and to secure the proper level of profitability on this route.\n(9)\nGiven the lack of a scheduled service between the cities of Gerona and Madrid since no air carrier offered this service, the Autonomous Government of Catalonia contacted several national carriers as well as carriers in other Member States of the Community (Aerolíneas de Baleares (AeBal), Spanair S.A. (Spanair), Air Europa Líneas Aéreas (Air Europe), KLM UK Ld, Intermed, Air Catalunya S.A. (Air Catalunya), Ibertrans Aérea S.A. (Ibertrans) and Navegación y Servicios Canarios S.A. (Naysa)) individually by letter during the period from July to November 2001 to inform them of its initiative to encourage the establishment of this air link and to call on them to submit tenders or state that they were prepared to ensure this air link.\n(10)\nAt the end of this process, the authorities of the Autonomous Government of Catalonia found that the only air carrier which had shown that it had the availability and capacity to ensure a regular air service and to fulfil the public service obligations inherent in it was Intermed and, consequently, the contract was concluded with this carrier.\n(11)\nAccording to the information received from the Spanish authorities, the Gerona-Madrid-Gerona air link was provided, firstly, by means of a scheduled service operated by Intermed as of 15 April 2002 with a 48-seat ATR 42-300 aircraft and, secondly, by a charter service operated by the complainant in this case as of 3 April 2002 using an SA-227 aircraft.\n(12)\nGerona airport is a small airport at which passenger numbers have developed as follows (3):\nDevelopment of passenger traffic\nYear\nNumber of passengers\nYear\nNumber of passengers\n1994\n399 070\n1999\n631 235\n1995\n547 739\n2000\n651 402\n1996\n480 506\n2001\n622 410\n1997\n533 445\n2002\n557 187\n1998\n610 607\n2003\n1 448 796\n(13)\nThe contract stipulates that, for the provision of the service in question, Intermed will use a turboprop ATR 42-300 aircraft having the following chief characteristics:\n-\n48 seats arranged in 12 rows with an inclination of 30 °;\n-\nmaximum loading capacity 4 687 kg;\n-\nvolume of baggage hold 8,94 m3;\n-\nmaximum altitude 5 485 m (18 000 feet);\n-\nflight speed 300 kt (556 km/h).\n(14)\nInitially, there will be two flights a day from Monday to Friday with the following timetables:\n-\nmorning: departure from Gerona at 07.00/departure from Madrid at 09.00.\n-\nafternoon: departure from Gerona at 17.00/departure from Madrid at 19.30.\n(15)\nIn general terms, the flight timetables must always allow passengers from Gerona a minimum stay of five hours in Madrid from the time of arrival at the destination.\n(16)\nThe maximum total amount of aid for the period covered by the contract is EUR 4 337 086,18. The Autonomous Government of Catalonia and the Gerona Regional Council undertake to bear the cost of funding the air service between Gerona and Madrid up to the following annual limits:\n-\n2002 financial year: for the 2002 financial year, during the first six months of operation of the air link, the Generalitat de Catalunya (Autonomous Government of Catalonia) and the Diputación de Girona (Gerona Regional Council) equally bear a maximum amount of EUR 410 582,34 each. For the rest of the 2002 financial year, the Autonomous Government of Catalonia and the Gerona Regional Council bear the cost of providing funding for this period up to the sum of EUR 34 166,62 for the Autonomous Government of Catalonia and EUR 135 227,75 for the Gerona Regional Council.\n-\n2003 financial year: for this period, including any regularisation of the 2002 financial year, the ceiling is EUR 1 182 883,13, with EUR 641 972,13 borne by the Autonomous Government of Catalonia and EUR 540 911 by the Gerona Regional Council.\n-\n2004 and 2005 financial years: for this period, the ceiling is EUR 1 081 822, with EUR 540 911 from the Gerona Regional Council as funding for the first half of each financial year, and EUR 540 911 from the Autonomous Government of Catalonia as funding for the second half of each financial year.\n(17)\nThe aid paid to Intermed is calculated on the basis of the average annual occupancy rate of the seats in the aircraft operating on the Gerona-Madrid-Gerona route by applying the formula set out in Annex V to the contract.\n(18)\nAccording to the information from the Spanish authorities, the cost per flight, calculated on the basis of an average occupancy rate of 32 persons, is EUR 3 980,55, broken down as follows:\nItem\nEUR\nDepreciation of the aircraft\n353,16\nInsurance\n480,00\nLine costs (including checking of the electrical system, the avionics and the landing gear and inspection of the fuel injection system)\n250,00\nFuel\n623,37\nStaff costs (cabin and ground crews, including social security)\n1 067,93\nAirport charges and landing fees\n447,81\nHandling (4)\n364,09\nEurocontrol (route charge)\n52,89\nPassenger services (catering, press, etc.)\n372,00\nTotal\n3 980,55\n(19)\nThe Gerona Regional Council also undertakes to establish and finance all advertising for the promotion and marketing of this air link during the period of validity of the contract up to a maximum of EUR 120 202.\n(20)\nSimilarly, the Gerona Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Navigation undertakes to do whatever proves to be necessary, within its field of competence, to support and ensure the smooth functioning of the air service covered by the contract.\n(21)\nIt is provided that the contract will be terminated as of right in the event, for example, of another air carrier establishing an air service between Gerona and Madrid with characteristics similar to those of the air service covered by the contract in terms, in particular, of the type of aircraft, frequency, fares and period of service without public aid or any other State funding.\n(22)\nThe contract is concluded for the period from 26 March 2002 to 31 December 2005. However, the service was suspended in December 2002 following the initiation of the Commission’s formal investigation procedure.\n(23)\nThe contract in question also contains provisions regarding the occupancy rate, regularity, punctuality, groundhandling services and applicable fares.\n(24)\nIn its decision to initiate the formal investigation procedure, the Commission expressed doubts regarding the compatibility of the aid in question with Article 86(2) of the EC Treaty, in particular the lack of compliance with the procedure established by Article 4 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2408/92 of 23 July 1992 on access for Community air carriers to intra-Community air routes (5).\n(25)\nIn particular, the Commission asked Spain to send it, firstly, data showing the need for compensation and the net costs of the public service in question and the data used to calculate the volume of compensation and, secondly, the reasons which justify non-compliance with the procedure established by Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 2408/92.\nIII. COMMENTS FROM PARTIES CONCERNED\n(26)\nThe company Air Catalunya points out that the air route between Gerona and Madrid was served, on the one hand, by the beneficiary of the aid and, on the other, by itself without public funding from 3 April 2002. The company draws attention to the harmful consequences it has suffered and the fact that there has been an obvious distortion of competition. It points out that the Gerona-Madrid-Gerona link has not been the subject of a public service obligation in accordance with the procedures established by Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 2408/92. The aid in question cannot be said to be compatible with the Treaty as it does not meet the requirements of necessity and proportionality which are inherent in a public service role. Air Catalunya therefore suspended its service in December 2002.\n(27)\nAustrian Airlines A.G. (Austrian Airlines) adds that the rules established in the Guidelines on the application of Articles 92 and 93 of the EC Treaty and Article 61 of the EEA Agreement to State aid in the aviation sector have not been followed in the case at issue.\nIV. COMMENTS BY THE KINGDOM OF SPAIN\n(28)\nThe Spanish authorities point out that, since the formal investigation procedure was initiated in December 2002, the payment of aid to Intermed has been suspended and that the company was consequently forced to suspend the Gerona-Madrid air service in December 2002 as it could not cover the costs involved, which shows that the air service in question is not profitable for any company.\n(29)\nThe part-funding of the Gerona-Madrid route is subject to a time limit, in particular until the route in question is consolidated and becomes profitable on its own.\n(30)\nThe Spanish authorities consider that the procedure which led to the selection of Intermed is not in compliance with the procedure laid down in Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 2408/92 to impose public service obligations on a given route.\n(31)\nThe Autonomous Government of Catalonia presented a formal request to the Spanish Ministry for Regional Development with a view to imposing a public service obligation (PSO) on the Gerona- Madrid route in conformity with Regulation (EEC) No 2408/92. However, this request was rejected by the Ministry in question on the grounds that there were not sufficient reasons to invoke Article 4 of that Regulation.\n(32)\nThe Spanish authorities consider that the material requirements demanded by Regulation (EEC) No 2408/92 for the service in question to be considered a public or general interest service are fully met.\n(33)\nThe fact that no airline is able to operate the route shows how little economic interest the route generates. Only public authority intervention therefore made it possible to guarantee the Gerona- Madrid route with certain assurances regarding the stability and regularity of the service. In this regard, it is important to point out that Air Catalunya started operating the Gerona-Madrid route at the same time as Intermed, i.e. in April 2002. Before that date and since 28 October 2001, the date on which the previous company stopped operating the route, no company had been covering the Gerona-Madrid route. This route, which is considered essential, was not operated for five months, justifying the necessary intervention by the public authorities in view of the importance of this route for citizens.\n(34)\nThe Spanish authorities draw attention to the importance of establishing an air link between Gerona and Madrid for the economic development of the region.\n(35)\nHowever, since the formal conditions for imposing the obligation have not been fulfilled, i.e. a call for tenders open to all companies and communicated to the Commission and the other Member States, the subsidy cannot benefit from the presumption that no State aid has been given within the meaning of Article 87 of the EC Treaty and must therefore be subject to the general rules of the Treaty which govern this matter. This analysis is confirmed by the guidelines for the evaluation of State aid to air carriers in the Commission communication on the application of Articles 92 and 93 of the Treaty and Article 61 of the EEA Agreement to State aids in the aviation sector (6), paragraph 23 of which states that ‘compensation of losses incurred by a carrier which has not been selected according to Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 2408/92 will continue to be assessed under the general State aid rules. The same rule applies to compensations which are not calculated on the basis of the criteria of Article 4(1)(h) of the Regulation’.\n(36)\nAccording to the Spanish authorities, the absence of a formal declaration of a public service obligation does not in any way affect the public service nature of the route in question.\n(37)\nAccording to the Spanish authorities, the compensation granted to Intermed may be considered to be State aid within the meaning of Article 87 of the EC Treaty, which is unlawful if no prior notification is sent to the Commission and Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 2408/92 is not complied with, but is nevertheless compatible with the common market pursuant to Article 86(2) of the Treaty. Although the latter is not the proper framework for the funding of public services imposed on air carriers, the particular features of this case and, more especially, the low impact on competition and Community trade, the suspension of the aid immediately following the initiation of the formal investigation procedure, the consequential suspension of the air service by Intermed, the low intensity of the aid and the short duration of the agreement limited to eight months may justify the exceptional application of the provision in question.\n(38)\nFor Article 86(2) to be applied, the compensation must be necessary and proportional.\n(39)\nThe requirements imposed on Intermed in the agreement regarding regularity, continuity, capacity and the fares for the service make the flights unprofitable for any company at all. Indeed, the conditions imposed by the authorities give rise to additional costs which a company operating on a commercial basis could not itself bear.\n(40)\nThe proof of this is that there is no significant competitor covering the Gerona-Madrid route subject to the requirements of frequency, capacity and continuity which have been imposed on Intermed. The company which operated this route in the past was forced to cease doing so as it was uneconomic. The fact is that several airlines which were asked by the Autonomous Government to offer such a service showed no interest in doing so and made it clear that they doubted whether such a service was economically viable.\n(41)\nAir Catalunya cannot be regarded as a significant competitor. In fact, Air Catalunya had been invited to take part in the selection procedure, but its tender could not be accepted since the company does not hold an air operator’s certificate (AOC) or a licence to operate in Spain (7). Even if the procedure provided for in Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 2408/92 for the imposition of the public service obligation had been followed, Air Catalunya would not have been able to take part in the tender procedure, which was restricted to companies which hold a licence to operate scheduled services. At any rate, the terms on which it offered its flights, which were not scheduled, differed considerably from the frequency and capacity imposed on Intermed. For example, when few seats were occupied in the aircraft chartered by Air Catalunya, the flight was cancelled and passengers were left without any rapid and efficient means of transport to get to Madrid.\n(42)\nLastly, the lack of profitability on the route in question is underlined by the fact that, even though the Intermed service has been withdrawn, no company, not even Air Catalunya, is providing a service.\n(43)\nThe aid granted to Intermed does not exceed the minimum compensation required to offset the additional costs incurred in meeting the requirements laid down by the authorities. The compensation given to Intermed amounts to EUR 919 879,98. As is clear from Annex III to the Agreement, the cost per flight, calculated on the basis of an average occupancy rate of 32 persons, is EUR 3 980,55. A total of 640 flights were operated by Intermed during the period of validity of the agreement generating revenue of EUR 876 934,30. The shortfall as a result of providing the service was about EUR 1 670 608,70. This figure is calculated from the cost of the flight, i.e. EUR 3 980,55, multiplied by the number of flights operated, in other words EUR 2 547 552,00, less the revenue received, namely EUR 876 943,30. Consequently, the aid granted by the public authorities (EUR 919 879,98) was less than the shortfall sustained by the company when operating on the Gerona-Madrid route between April and December 2002.\n(44)\nAs the Court of Justice of the European Communities has consistently held, ‘the grant of State aid may, under Article 86(2) of the Treaty, escape the prohibition laid down in Article 87 of that Treaty provided that the sole purpose of the aid in question is to offset the extra costs incurred in performing the particular task assigned to an undertaking entrusted with the operation of a service of general economic interest and that the grant of the aid is necessary in order for that undertaking to be able to perform its public service obligations under conditions of economic equilibrium’ (8).\n(45)\nThe aid given to Intermed is of low intensity as it is less than EUR 1 million. To this must be added the relative shortness of the contract (only eight months: April to December 2002).\n(46)\nThe position of Air Catalunya or other potential competitors on the route in question will not be damaged in future since payment of the aid was suspended on initiation of the procedure, and the Autonomous Government and the Gerona Regional Council have undertaken to revoke formally the contract concluded with Intermed.\n(47)\nAny negative impact of the grant of aid to Intermed on competition and trade between the Member States is therefore minimised.\n(48)\nThe Spanish authorities consider that the case law which emerges in the Altmark case (pending before the ECJ at the date on which the Spanish authorities sent their comments) would not be applicable to the case at issue since this case is concerned with the application of Article 73 of the Treaty to impose public service obligations outside the framework provided for by the applicable regulations on inland transport.\n(49)\nThe Spanish authorities consider that the procedure initiated following the subsidies granted to Intermed can be concluded by adopting a Commission Decision that declares the aid to be unlawful and requires it to be suspended, but does not order the aid paid to be recovered and regards it as compatible with the common market pursuant to Article 86(2).\nV. ASSESSMENT OF THE AID\n(50)\nArticle 87(1) of the Treaty indicates that any aid granted by the States or through State resources in any form whatsoever which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or certain production is incompatible with the common market insofar as it affects trade between Member States.\n(51)\nParagraph 18 of the Commission Communication on the application of Articles 92 and 93 of the EC Treaty and Article 61 of the EEA Agreement to State aid in the aviation sector establishes the presumption that no aid is involved provided that a public service obligation was imposed and the relevant compensation calculated in conformity with the procedures provided for in Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 2408/92 on access for Community air carriers to intra-Community air routes. The criteria for assessing whether aid is involved in compensation for public services were subsequently clarified by the judgment of 24 July 2003 in the Altmark case (9).\n(52)\nAs explained in recitals 9 to 23 to this Decision, the authorities of the Autonomous Government of Catalonia selected the company without fulfilling the obligations established in Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 2408/92, which are essential to guarantee the principle of equal treatment and proper functioning of the procedure.\n(53)\nIn particular,\n-\nthe Commission was not informed of the imposition of a public service obligation on the Gerona-Madrid-Gerona route,\n-\nthese obligations were not published in the Official Journal of the European Union,\n-\nthe other Member States were not consulted,\n-\nthe invitation to tender was not published in the Official Journal of the European Union and\n-\nthe tenders submitted by the air carriers were not communicated to the other Member States concerned or to the Commission.\n(54)\nThe Spanish authorities consider that the measure in question is, nonetheless, compensation for public service obligations imposed on Intermed.\n(55)\nThe Commission considers that the only way of establishing public service obligations in the aviation sector is by applying Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 2408/92. In this Regulation, the Council has established uniform, non-discriminatory rules for the granting of air traffic rights on routes on which public service obligations have been imposed. The criteria for calculating the compensation are clearly defined. In the absence of any information to the contrary, reimbursement calculated in accordance with Article 4(1)(h) of the Regulation would have made it possible to presume that there was no financial advantage for the air carrier concerned (10).\n(56)\nArticle 4(1)(h) of Regulation (EEC) No 2408/92 provides that ‘a Member State may reimburse an air carrier, which has been selected under subparagraph (f), for satisfying standards required by a public service obligation imposed under this paragraph; such reimbursement shall take account of the costs and revenue generated by the service’. The Commission considers that the measure envisaged by the Spanish authorities in regard to the company Intermed does not comply with the provisions of Article 4 of the Regulation.\n(57)\nIt follows that the said presumption of the non-existence of aid does not apply in this case.\n(58)\nParagraph 23 of the guidelines on State aid in the aviation sector states that ‘compensation of losses incurred by a carrier which has not been selected according to Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 2408/92 will continue to be assessed under the general State aid rules. The same rule applies to compensations which are not calculated on the basis of the criteria of Article 4(1)(h) of the Regulation’. Similarly, paragraph 17 establishes that ‘the acceptability of the reimbursement shall be considered in the light of the State aid principles as interpreted in the Court of Justice's case law’.\n(59)\nThe Commission takes the view that where, in a specific sector, Community regulations stipulate that public service obligations must be awarded by a tender procedure, failure to comply with these regulations means that the compensation granted normally constitutes aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) of the Treaty. Nonetheless, the Commission assesses whether the measure in question grants a financial advantage to Intermed, and in particular, whether the compensation in question complies with the criteria established by the Court’s case law, in particular the judgment of 24 July 2003 in the Altmark case.\n(60)\nThis judgment confirms that amounts granted as compensation for public service obligations are not State aid provided several conditions are met. According to the Court, it follows from those judgments (11)‘that, where a State measure must be regarded as compensation for the services provided by the recipient undertakings in order to discharge public service obligations, so those undertakings do not enjoy a real financial advantage and the measure thus does not have the effect of putting them in a more favourable competitive position than the undertakings competing with them, such a measure is not caught by Article 92(1) of the Treaty. However, for such compensation to escape classification as State aid in a particular case, a number of conditions must be satisfied’ (12).\n(61)\nThe Court has established four conditions. The first three conditions apply in all cases. The fourth condition provides for two alternatives in order to eliminate any financial advantage whatsoever from the compensation.\n(62)\nAccording to the first condition established by the Court, the recipient undertaking must actually have been required to discharge public service obligations and those obligations must have been clearly defined. According to the second condition, the parameters on the basis of which the compensation is calculated must have been established beforehand in an objective and transparent manner.\n(63)\nIn the case at issue, the recipient undertaking has been required to discharge certain obligations which are defined in the contract. These obligations as well as the parameters for calculation of the compensation, as established in Annexes III, IV and V to the contract, are the result of negotiations conducted between the competent regional authorities and the company which had already been selected to provide the air transport service. In fact, the Autonomous Government of Catalonia had contacted several carriers individually by letter during the period July to November 2001 in order to inform them of its initiative to encourage the establishment of this air route and to invite them to submit tenders or to state that they were prepared to operate this air service. During this process, the regional authorities invited only the airlines contacted to submit a tender. These letters contain no details about the obligations imposed on the companies or the parameters regarding compensation. It cannot be ruled out that the airlines which did not respond to the request from the regional authorities might have been interested in concluding the contract if more specific details about these obligations and the parameters for calculating the compensation had been available when the request was sent out by the regional authorities.\nThe Commission considers that, in the case at issue, the public service obligations were not defined in a clear and transparent manner and that, consequently, the first condition laid down in the Altmark judgment was not satisfied.\n(64)\nFurthermore, the contract concluded on 26 March 2002 between the Autonomous Government of Catalonia, the Gerona Regional Council, the Chamber of Trade and Industry of Gerona and the representative of Intermediación Aérea SL (Intermed) was simply announced by a press release but was not officially published and, according to the Commission’s information, was not accessible to interested third parties. In addition, in the air transport sector the parameters for calculating compensation in advance in an objective and transparent manner are established by the method laid down by the Community legislator in Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 2408/92, which has not been complied with.\n(65)\nIn addition, the Commission considers that the parameters on the basis of which the compensation is calculated in the case at hand were not established in advance in an objective and transparent manner. The second condition of the Altmark judgment has therefore not been satisfied.\n(66)\nAccording to the third condition laid down by the Court, the compensation must not exceed what is necessary to cover all or part of the costs incurred in the discharge of the public service obligations, taking into account the relevant receipts and a reasonable profit for discharging those obligations. Compliance with such a condition is essential to ensure that the recipient undertaking is not given any advantage which distorts or threatens to distort competition by strengthening that undertaking’s competitive position. The purpose of this condition is to avoid overcompensation being paid to undertakings and to avoid the situation where the type and amount of compensation granted means that the undertaking has surplus cash which it could devote to activities which might distort competition. In the aviation sector, the method used by the legislator to avoid such overcompensation and to minimise any harmful effects of limiting market access is strict compliance with the tender procedure laid down in Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 2408/92.\n(67)\nThe Commission considers that such a tender procedure prior to a purchase by a Member State is normally regarded as sufficient to rule out the possibility that the Member State concerned is seeking to grant an advantage to a particular undertaking. The Court of First Instance has confirmed this approach (13). In the absence of an invitation to tender, it believes that it is difficult to determine precisely whether the amount received by Intermed corresponds to the costs arising from discharging the public service obligations, or whether it represents overcompensation and an advantage in its favour.\n(68)\nThe Spanish authorities consider that the amount of the subsidy granted is less than the deficit run up in the months during which the service was operated and that, consequently, there has been no overcompensation. The Commission considers that, in the absence of objective means of establishing the level of compensation pursuant to the compulsory rules laid down by the Council, it cannot be ruled out that other companies may have been able to offer the services in question with a lower level of subsidy.\n(69)\nThe Commission considers that the third condition of the Altmark judgment is not satisfied in the case at issue.\n(70)\nThe fourth condition contains two alternatives:\n(a)\neither ‘the undertaking which is to discharge public service obligations, in a specific case, is chosen pursuant to a public procurement procedure which would allow for the selection of the tenderer capable of providing those services at the least cost to the community’,\n(b)\nor ‘the level of compensation needed must be determined on the basis of an analysis of the costs which a typical undertaking, well run and adequately provided with means of transport so as to be able to meet the necessary public service requirements, would have incurred in discharging those obligations, taking into account the relevant receipts and a reasonable profit for discharging the obligations’.\n(71)\nThe first alternative of the fourth condition is not satisfied in the case at issue. The selection procedure followed by the Spanish authorities does not comply with the criteria of transparency and objectivity which are essential for any public tender procedure, as pointed out in recitals 51 and 52 to this Decision, to be regarded as genuine competition and therefore cannot be regarded as sufficiently transparent to ensure ‘the least cost to the community’.\n(72)\nThe second alternative of the fourth condition referred to in recital 70(b) seems to apply in principle only where there is no obligation to issue an invitation to tender and not where the obligation exists but has not been complied with. Nonetheless, assuming that the second alternative of the fourth condition should be applied to the case at issue, the Commission must conclude that it has not been complied with. The compensation was not calculated on the basis ‘of an analysis of the costs which a typical undertaking, well run and adequately provided with means of transport so as to be able to meet the necessary public service requirements, would have incurred in discharging those requirements, taking into account the relevant receipts and a reasonable profit for discharging the obligations’. As explained in the analysis of the second condition, the authorities did not carry out any advance analysis of the costs or of whether or not they were compatible with this standard, but confined themselves to providing compensation for the actual costs incurred by the operator in question. The Spanish authorities have not provided any data which enable the Commission to carry out such a check. In these circumstances, it is obvious that the fourth condition laid down in the Altmark judgment has also not been satisfied.\n(73)\nThe Commission therefore finds that none of the conditions of the Altmark judgment has been satisfied in the case at issue. In the light of the foregoing, the measure involves an advantage for the beneficiary.\n(74)\nThe concept of State aid under the terms of the Treaty and as interpreted by the Court of Justice refers to any advantage granted directly or indirectly through State resources or constituting an additional burden for the State or the bodies appointed or set up for this purpose.\n(75)\nIn the case at issue, the contract provides that the beneficiary company will receive a maximum of EUR 4 337 086,18 for the duration of the contract funded by the Autonomous Government of Catalonia and the Gerona Regional Council. As confirmed by the Spanish authorities, the amount of aid actually paid amounts to EUR 919 879,98. The fact that this amount was directly granted by the Spanish authorities clearly confirms the presence of State resources.\n(76)\nThe measures in question concern only one transport sector, namely air transport, and the provision of a single air route: Gerona-Madrid-Gerona.\n(77)\nThe contract was concluded with a single airline. From the information received from the Spanish authorities, it is not possible to deduce that the same measures would have applied to other companies which might have decided to provide scheduled air transport services between Madrid and Gerona.\n(78)\nThe measure in question is therefore considered to be selective.\n(79)\nIn order to make a finding of a distortion of competition, it is sufficient for the State intervention artificially to modify certain elements of an undertaking’s production cost and to strengthen that undertaking’s position vis-à-vis other undertakings competing in intra-Community trade (14). The Court considers (15) that it is not impossible that a public subsidy granted to an undertaking which provides only local or regional transport services and does not provide any transport services outside its State of origin may nonetheless have an effect on trade between Member States. Furthermore, the Court also stressed that aid could be capable of affecting trade between Member States and distorting the conditions of competition, even if, while in competition with undertakings in other Member States, the undertaking receiving the aid is not participating itself in cross-border activities. Where a Member State grants aid to an undertaking, internal supply may be maintained or increased with the consequence that the opportunities for undertakings established in other Member States to offer their services to the market of that Member State are reduced (16).\n(80)\nIn accordance with the third recital thereto and Article 1(a) thereof, Commission Regulation (EC) No 69/2001 of 12 January 2001 on the application of Articles 87 and 88 of the EC Treaty to de minimis aid (17) does not apply to the transport sector. According to the Court’s case law, there is no threshold or percentage below which it may be considered that trade between the Member States is not affected. The relatively small amount of aid or the relatively small size of the undertaking which receives it does not as such exclude the possibility that trade between Member States might be affected (18).\n(81)\nIn the case at issue, the air link between Gerona and Madrid is served by two operators, one receiving public funding and the other not receiving public funding.\n(82)\nIt is true that the contract contains a termination clause which applies in the event of another air carrier establishing an air service between Gerona and Madrid with characteristics similar to those of the air service covered by the contract concerned in terms, in particular, of the type of aircraft, frequency, fares and the period of service without public aid or any other State funding.\n(83)\nHowever, if any competing operator provides services which do not comply with the abovementioned characteristics (for example, the use of a smaller aircraft), the selective nature would even be confirmed since two operators would be operating on the same route, one receiving aid and the other not. In fact, the complainant in this case operates the Gerona-Madrid-Gerona air link without receiving public aid. According to the information received from the Spanish authorities, the complainant has established a charter flight operation on the Gerona-Madrid-Gerona route using aircraft with less than 20 seats, which does not meet the requirements of the contract.\n(84)\nFurthermore, the measures in question affect trade between the Member States since they concern a company whose transport activity, which by its nature directly affects trade, covers part of the common market. In addition, they distort competition within this market since they are aimed at only one single undertaking which is in competition with another Community airline, in particular since the entry into force of the third air transport liberalisation package (third package) on 1 January 1993. Under these circumstances, the granting of advantages to Intermed by the Spanish authorities is aid within the meaning of Article 87 of the EC Treaty.\n(85)\nThe measures agreed by the Gerona Regional Council with a view to establishing and financing all the advertising for the promotion and marketing of this air route during the period of validity of the contract up to a maximum of EUR 120 202 must also be regarded as State aid. These measures, which are financed from public funds, are intended to make the creation of the new air service known to the general public.\n(86)\nAs the conditions of Article 87(1) of the Treaty are met, the Commission must conclude that the measure is a State aid measure which must be examined in order to ascertain whether it is compatible with the Treaty.\n(87)\nThe Commission deplores the fact that Spain implemented the aid in contravention of Article 88(2) of the EC Treaty.\n(88)\nHaving determined that the measures under consideration are in the nature of State aid falling within the scope of Article 87(1) of the Treaty, an assessment confirmed by the Spanish authorities, the Commission must examine whether the measures may be considered compatible with the common market within the meaning of Article 87(2) and (3) and Article 86(2) of the Treaty.\n(89)\nThe Commission must assess the compatibility of the aid pursuant to Article 87(2)(a) of the Treaty, according to which aid having a social character, granted to individual consumers, is compatible with the common market, provided that the aid is granted without discrimination related to the origin of the products concerned. According to the Commission Communication on State aid in the aviation sector, the aid must have a social character, i.e. it must, in principle, only cover specific categories of passengers travelling on a route (children, handicapped people, low income people). However, in case the route concerned links an underprivileged region, mainly islands, the aid could cover the entire population of this region. According to the same communication, the aid has to be granted without discrimination as to the origin of the services, that is to say whatever EEA air carriers operate the services. This also implies the absence of any barrier to entry on the route concerned for all Community air carriers.\n(90)\nIn the case at issue, the aid has been paid solely to one airline operating the link in question, to the exclusion of the competing operator. The legal basis of this aid does not seem to allow other airlines access to the aid scheme. Consequently, this aid does not satisfy the first of the conditions required, namely non-discrimination between operators.\n(91)\nThe derogation provided for in Article 87(2)(b) does not apply since, in the case at issue, the aid is not intended to make good the damage caused by natural disasters or exceptional occurrences.\n(92)\nArticle 87(3) lists the aid which may be considered to be compatible with the common market.\n(93)\nIn order to safeguard the proper functioning of the common market, and having regard to the principles set out in Article 3(1)(g) of the Treaty, the derogations from Article 87(1), as defined in Article 87(3), must be strictly interpreted when examining an aid scheme or any individual measure. Furthermore, in view of the increased competition following the liberalisation of air transport, the Commission must abide by a rigorous policy of monitoring State aid to make sure that it does not have any secondary effects which are contrary to the common interest:\n-\nparagraphs (a) and (c) allow derogations for aid to promote or facilitate the development of certain areas (19). The Commission notes that the Gerona region is not an area covered by Article 87(3)(a) and that this derogation is therefore not applicable. The Commission further notes that the Gerona region is not eligible to benefit from the derogation in Article 87(3)(c) of the Treaty, except districts situated in the Pyrenees which are not relevant in this case;\n-\nparagraphs (b) and (d) are not applicable since the aid is not intended to promote an important project of common interest or to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy of a Member State or to promote culture and heritage conservation and, in any case, the Spanish authorities have not invoked the derogation;\n-\nthe derogation provided for in paragraph (c) concerns aid to facilitate the development of certain economic activities. The Commission considers that operational aid which is not intended to encourage investment may be authorised only in exceptional circumstances. To this end, it notes that the aid is neither for environmental nor for training purposes. Furthermore, the Commission can allow this derogation to apply to the restructuring of an undertaking. This is not the case with Intermed.\n(94)\nHowever, the aid can be compared to start-up aid, an analysis of which is made in recital 101.\n(95)\nThe only justification invoked by the Spanish authorities concerns the application of Article 86(2) of the Treaty. In this respect, the Commission considers that, for aid to be declared compatible on the basis of this provision of the Treaty, two conditions must be satisfied: the necessity and the proportionality of the aid.\n(96)\nThe Commission should point out that the Spanish authorities do not contest that the provisions regarding Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 2408/92 have not been complied with. This would suggest that the Spanish authorities did not consider it necessary to impose public service obligations on the air link in question. This was confirmed when the administrative procedure had already been initiated by the Commission since, at the request of the Catalan regional authorities of 13 June 2002, the competent Spanish authorities refused to initiate the procedure to impose public service obligations on the grounds that there were not sufficient reasons to invoke Article 4 of the said Regulation (20). In these circumstances, it would be contradictory to maintain, on the one hand, that the service is necessary within the framework of Article 86(2) of the Treaty and, on the other, to consider that the service in question is not necessary in order to apply the normal legal framework applicable to public service obligations in the aviation sector.\n(97)\nIn the absence of compliance with the procedure established in Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 2408/92, the proportionality of the aid also cannot be confirmed. The Spanish authorities consider that the amount of the subsidy granted is less than the deficit run up in the months during which the service was operated and that there has therefore not been any overcompensation. The Commission does not dispute that the amount of aid is less than the deficit for the service, but it does consider that, in the absence of objective means for establishing the level of compensation pursuant to the mandatory rules laid down by the Council, it cannot be ruled out that other companies would have been able to offer the service in question with a lower level of subsidy.\n(98)\nAs is clear from the Court’s case law (21), a joint assessment of compatibility must be carried out where certain arrangements of the aid contravene specific provisions of the EC Treaty other than Articles 87 and 88, and are inextricably linked to the object of the aid in such a manner that it is impossible to evaluate them separately. In such a situation, the conditions of these other provisions would be added to the compatibility requirements arising from Article 86(2) of the EC Treaty. In addition, it is clear that a State aid procedure must never lead to a result which is contrary to the specific provisions of the Treaty (22), or to Community regulations adopted on the basis of such provisions.\n(99)\nIn the case at issue, the procedure in Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 2408/92 is inextricably linked to the aid. In accordance with this case law, it is not possible to declare aid compatible if the arrangements for granting it have not complied with Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 2408/92. Furthermore, the last sentence of Article 86(2) of the Treaty also contains an additional requirement: ‘the development of trade must not be affected to such an extent as would be contrary to the interests of the Community’. The Commission considers that, in a case such as this, it would be contrary to the Community interest to authorise aid which has been granted in breach of Regulation (EEC) No 2408/92.\n(100)\nConsequently, the aid in question cannot be declared to be compatible with Article 86(2) of the Treaty.\n(101)\nIn recital 278 of Commission Decision 2004/393/EC of 12 February 2004 concerning advantages granted by the Walloon Region and Brussels South Charleroi airport to the airline Ryanair in connection with its establishment at Charleroi (23), the Commission considers that aid measures that allow the development and better operation of regional airport infrastructures that are currently under-used and represent a cost to the local community may be of interest at European Community level and form part of the objectives of the common transport policy.\n(102)\nIn this Decision, the Commission considered that certain operational aid intended to help the launch of new airlines or strengthen certain frequencies may be a necessary tool for the development of small regional airports. The measures may indeed persuade the interested companies to take the risk of investing in new routes. However, in order to declare such aid compatible on the basis of Article 87(3)(c) of the Treaty, it should be determined whether this aid is necessary and in proportion to the objectives sought, and whether it affects trade to an extent that is contrary to the common interest.\n(103)\nOperating aid is rarely likely to be declared compatible with the common market as it usually distorts conditions of competition in the areas where it is granted, without however being capable, because of its very nature, of achieving any of the aims laid down by the exemption provisions in the Treaty. In fact, as it does not involve any technical or structural alteration to the business and favours only its commercial development, it only allows the business to offer artificially favourable conditions to its clients and to increase its profit margin without justification.\n(104)\nThere are, however, a number of exceptions to this principle and the Commission has in the past declared this type of aid compatible, provided certain conditions are met (24).\n(105)\nIn order to declare such aid compatible on the basis of Article 87(3)(c), it is therefore necessary to determine whether the aid paid in the case at issue is necessary and proportionate to the objective sought and whether it does not affect trade to a degree which is contrary to the common interest.\n(106)\nThe first condition for granting start-up aid is that it forms part of a coherent airport development project and reflects a willingness to develop the profitability of infrastructures that are not always profitable.\n(107)\nThe promotion of regional development, tourism, the local economy or the regional image will therefore be no more than a spin-off of this coherent policy intended first and foremost to develop airport activities on a long-term basis.\n(108)\nRegional airports could also provide a solution to one problem of transport policy: that of capacity saturation at major airports (25).\n(109)\nIn this case, no information suggests that other companies wishing to start up routes between Gerona and other destinations have had access to similar aid. The Commission has not been informed about the existence of any such project for the development of airport activities. The Spanish authorities merely state that Gerona airport did not have any scheduled flights until the establishment of the service between Gerona and Madrid.\n(110)\nThe Commission defined the criterion of the need for aid in the Ryanair Decision (26). In this respect, start-up aid must be essential for the development of the airport. Certain conditions must be met.\n(111)\nFirstly, the aid granted to the airlines should apply only to the opening of new routes or new frequencies, generating an increase in the net volume of passengers departing from the regional airport, so that part of the risk borne by the company is taken on.\n(112)\nSecondly, the aid should not be paid where the route is already being operated: the risk being run by the company is less, maybe even zero, and the need for aid is not justified. Thus, when a company already operates a route from an airport, it will not be able to benefit from public aid.\n(113)\nThirdly, aid must not be paid to an airline for any new route that it starts operating in substitution for, and following the abandonment of, an old route that had previously benefited from start-up aid. All other things being equal, the airport would not have any net positive effect in terms of the number of passengers arriving at its site. Furthermore, the aid could not be granted for a route provided by the company in replacement for another route that it had previously served from another airport located in the same economic catchment area or population centre. The Commission in fact considers it essential that start-up aid does not create any spiral subsidy, for example through such relocations of routes once the maximum aid has been granted. Such a practice would in fact run contrary to the whole objective of start-up aid, which is development of the airport concerned in keeping with the common interest.\n(114)\nFourthly, aid must not be intended to assist a new entrant to open links that are already open and enter into direct competition with an existing operator already working on that route from the airport. The new arrival must rely on its own strength alone, and not on public aid, to compete with an existing operator.\n(115)\nWith regard to the first, second and fourth conditions, it should be pointed out that the Gerona-Madrid-Gerona route was being operated by another company until 28 October 2001, but that the company abandoned the service as unprofitable. The route was not being operated by another carrier at the time of conclusion of the contract between the public authorities concerned and Intermed on 26 March 2002. However, another operator, Air Catalunya, started operating the same link a few days later, on 3 April 2002. Intermed started operating on 15 April 2002. The fact that the two companies started operating the Gerona-Madrid-Gerona route 12 days apart makes it impossible to determine clearly and definitively whether the service provided by Intermed can be considered to be a new route.\n(116)\nThe third condition is met in the case at issue since the Madrid-Gerona-Madrid route was the first operated by Intermed.\n(117)\nThe start-up expenditure on marketing and advertising to make the route known may be considered to be necessary in view of its aim, which is to inform the general public about the existence of such an air route.\n(118)\nAid must have an incentive effect: it must allow a business to develop an activity that it would not have embarked upon without public support. This activity, however, must prove itself to be profitable without aid in the long term. For this reason, aid intended for launching new connections or for increasing frequencies must be limited in time. Aid is used to launch a new route, but it cannot maintain the route artificially: routes must eventually be economically viable.\n(119)\nThe Commission has considered that, in the framework of start-up aid in the aviation sector (27), a maximum period of five years following the opening of each connection is reasonable, in particular for intra-European, point-to-point links.\n(120)\nIn the case at issue, the part-funding of the Gerona-Madrid route and the publicity measures are limited in time (the contract was valid for three years), in particular until the route in question has been consolidated and achieves profitability itself or because another air operator, without public aid or any other State funding, establishes an air service between Gerona and Madrid which has the same characteristics as the service covered by the contract concerned as regards, in particular, the type of aircraft, frequency, fares and service period.\n(121)\nProportionality must be established in the form of two links between the aid and its context. Firstly, there must be a strict link between the aim of the airport development, via the net growth of passenger traffic, and the level of aid paid to the airline. The total aid must therefore be calculated per passenger. An airline that cannot deliver to an airport the volume of passengers necessary for its development will not therefore be unduly favoured. Conversely, a company that meets the targets that make development of the airport possible will reap the benefit.\n(122)\nThe second link which must be assessed with regard to proportionality between the aid and the costs incurred by its beneficiary. The Commission points out that the aid intensity, which the Commission limits to 50 % in the case of start-up aid, does not apply to all the operating costs, net of receipts, of the airline concerned.\n(a)\nThe only costs eligible for start-up aid are the additional start-up costs that the air operator would not have to bear once ‘cruising speed’ is reached and that require a public contribution in order to share the risk of non-viability linked to the start-up period. In the case of Intermed, they concern, for example, the marketing and advertising costs incurred at the outset for making the link known, and the start-up costs borne by Intermed at the Gerona site.\n(b)\nConversely, aid cannot be granted in relation to Intermed’s standard operational costs such as hire or depreciation of aircraft, fuel, crew salaries or catering service costs.\n(123)\nThe amount of aid granted to an airline for the development of air services must be transparent. For example, it should be calculated per embarking passenger in order to be easily identified and identifiable.\n(124)\nThe fact that an airport is ready to grant aid in return for economic services such as the launch of new routes must be publicised in order to make it possible for the interested airlines to present themselves and stake their claim. The rules and principles relating to procurement contracts and concessions should therefore be observed where applicable.\n(125)\nObjective criteria must be developed by any airport wishing to encourage development of air services in terms of maximum totals and periods for aid, in order to ensure equal treatment between airlines.\n(126)\nAppeal procedures must be provided at Member State level in order to ensure that no discrimination is exercised in the granting of aid and that no airline is favoured unfairly at a given airport.\n(127)\nPenalty mechanisms must be implemented as and when a carrier fails to keep to the undertakings that it has made in relation to an airport when the aid is paid. A system for recovering aid may allow the airport to ensure that the airline is honouring its commitments. The contract in the case at issue does in fact contain a mechanism for recovering aid if Intermed does not honour its commitments.\n(128)\nThe aid granted cannot in principle be combined with other subsidies received by air carriers if it is aid of a social nature or compensation for public services defined as aid. Neither may it, in accordance with the rules of proportionality described above, be combined with other aid for the same costs, including aid paid in another State. The sum total of aid from which a new route benefits must never exceed 50 % of the start-up costs for the destination in question.\n(129)\nIn order to preserve the incentive character of start-up aid for air links over time as a development tool for regional airports only, the Commission believes it necessary to ensure that such aid cannot give any indirect advantage to large airports already largely open to international traffic and competition. Specific attention should therefore be paid to limiting eligible costs when an airline links Gerona (in this case) with a major airport such as Madrid.\n(130)\nIn addition, such aid cannot be granted when access to a route has been reserved for one carrier only under Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 2408/92, and in particular paragraph 1(d) of that Article.\n(131)\nIn the case at issue, Intermed does not receive, for its routes from Gerona, subsidies by way of social aid or compensation for public services, as referred to above. Nor is access to the route operated by Intermed from Gerona reserved for this carrier alone under a tender procedure as provided for in Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 2408/92.\n(132)\nThe Commission notes that the aid paid by the Autonomous Government of Catalonia, the Gerona Regional Council, and the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Gerona to Intermed fulfils some of the conditions applicable to start-up aid intended to promote air services operating out of regional airports, but that others have not been fulfilled and that conditions must therefore be imposed in certain cases to ensure compatibility.\n(133)\nThe amounts paid by the Autonomous Government of Catalonia, the Gerona Regional Council, and the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Gerona as funding for the air service between Gerona and Madrid are considered to be compatible with the common market as start-up aid for new routes, subject to the following conditions:\n(a)\nThe contributions must form part of a programme for the development of Gerona airport;\n(b)\nAll of the contributions must be subject to a time limit. This period will not exceed a maximum of five years following the opening of the route in question.\n(c)\nThese contributions may not be paid if the aid is intended to help a new entrant to open links that are already open and to enter into direct competition with an existing operator who is already operating this route under similar conditions departing from Gerona airport.\n(d)\nThe contributions must be justified by means of a development plan established by Intermed and validated beforehand by the competent authorities for the route concerned. This plan will specify the costs incurred and eligible, which must be directly concerned with the promotion of the route in order to make it viable without aid following the termination of the contract. Eligible costs are those directly related to the start-up, as described in recital 122 to this Decision. The competent authorities will, if necessary, be assisted by an independent auditor during this task.\n(e)\nThe sum total of aid from which a new route benefits must never exceed 50 % of the start-up and advertising costs for the destination in question. Similarly, the contributions paid may not exceed 50 % of the actual costs in connection with this destination.\n(f)\nAny contributions paid by the Autonomous Government of Catalonia, the Gerona Regional Council, and the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Gerona which, at the end of the start-up period provided for in the contract, prove to have exceeded the criteria thus laid down must be reimbursed by Intermed.\n(g)\nSpain must establish a non-discriminatory, transparent aid scheme to ensure equal treatment for airlines wishing to develop new air services departing from Gerona airport, in accordance with the objective criteria established by this Decision.\n(134)\nShould these conditions not be met, Spain must recover all of the corresponding aid referred to in the above recital.\nVI. CONCLUSIONS\nThe Commission concludes that Spain has unlawfully implemented aid for the airline Intermediación Aérea SL in breach of Article 88(3) of the Treaty. However, in view of the contribution which this aid may make toward launching new air transport services and the lasting development of a regional airport, part of the aid may be declared to be compatible with the common market, subject to the conditions set out in recital 133,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\nArticle 1\nThe State aid implemented by the Kingdom of Spain for the airline Intermediación Aérea SL, amounting to EUR 919 879,98, on the one hand, and EUR 120 202 on the other, is hereby declared to be compatible with the common market on the basis of Article 87(3)(c) as start-up aid for new routes, subject to the following conditions.\nArticle 2\n1. The contributions shall form part of a programme for the development of Gerona airport.\n2. All of the contributions shall be subject to a time limit. This period shall not exceed a maximum of five years following the opening of the route in question.\n3. These contributions may not be paid if the aid is intended to help a new entrant to open links which are already open and to enter into direct competition with an existing operator who is already operating this route under similar conditions departing from Gerona airport.\n4. The contributions shall be justified by means of a development plan established by Intermed and validated beforehand by the competent authorities for the route concerned. This plan shall specify the costs incurred and eligible, which must be directly concerned with the promotion of the route in order to make it viable without aid when the contract between Intermed and the Autonomous Government of Catalonia, the Gerona Regional Council and the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Gerona expires.\n5. The eligible costs, directly related to start-up, shall meet the following conditions:\n(a)\nthey shall cover the additional start-up costs which the airline would not have had to bear if it had been fully operational and which require a public contribution in order to share the risk of non-viability linked to the start-up period;\n(b)\nconversely, they shall not cover standard operational costs such as hire or depreciation of aircraft, fuel, crew salaries or catering service costs.\nThe competent authorities shall, if necessary, be assisted by an independent auditor during this task.\n6. The total sum of aid from which a new route benefits shall never exceed 50 % of the start-up and advertising costs for the destination in question. Similarly, the contributions paid may not exceed 50 % of the actual costs in connection with this destination.\n7. Any contributions paid by the Autonomous Government of Catalonia, the Gerona Regional Council and the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Gerona which, at the end of the start-up period provided for in the contract, prove to have exceeded the criteria thus laid down shall be reimbursed by Intermed.\n8. Spain shall establish a non-discriminatory, transparent aid scheme to ensure equal treatment for airlines wishing to develop new air services departing from Gerona airport, in accordance with the objective criteria laid down in this Decision.\nArticle 3\n1. The Kingdom of Spain shall take all necessary measures to recover, from the beneficiary, aid which is incompatible with the common market as referred to in Article 2 and unlawfully made available.\n2. Recovery shall take place immediately in accordance with the procedures of national law, provided that they permit the immediate, effective implementation of this Decision. The aid recovered shall include interest compounded from the date on which the aid is made available to the beneficiary until the date of recovery. The interest shall be calculated on the basis of the reference rate used to calculate the grant equivalent in the framework of regional aid.\nArticle 4\nThe Kingdom of Spain shall inform the Commission, within two months of the date of notification of this Decision, of the measures taken to comply with it.\nArticle 5\nThis Decision is addressed to the Kingdom of Spain.\nDone at Brussels, 20 October 2004.",

Such zones were defined in Commission Directive 92/76/EEC of 6 October 1992, recognising protected zones exposed to particular plant health risks in the Community(2) as last amended by Directive 2000/23/EC(3).\n(2) Since then, there have been significant developments in the plant health status of some of these zones initially recognised as protected zones in respect of the relevant harmful organisms.\n(3) From information supplied by Denmark it appears that it is no longer appropriate to maintain the protected zone recognised for Denmark in respect of Bemisia tabaci Genn. (European populations) and tomato spotted wilt virus.\n(4) Certain provisions on protective measures in Portugal against Gonipterus scutellatus Gyll. and in the United Kingdom and in Ireland against Pissodes spp. (European) should be modified to take into account the present distribution of these organisms in the respective countries.\n(5) From information supplied by United Kingdom and Sweden it appears that following local government reorganisation, the current description of the respective protected zones in respect of Dendroctonus micans Kugelan and Leptinotarsa decemlineata Say should be modified.\n(6) Under Directive 92/76/EEC, Austria, Ireland and the regions of Apulia, Emilia-Romagna, Lombardia and Veneto in Italy were provisionally recognised as protected zone in respect of Erwinia amylovora (Burr.) Winsl. et al. for a period expiring on 31 March 2001.\n(7) From information supplied by Ireland it appears that the provisional recognition of the protected zones for Ireland in respect of Erwinia amylovora (Burr.) Winsl. et al. should be extended for a further limited period.\n(8) From information supplied by Austria and Italy it appears that some areas within Austria and Italy should not longer be recognised as protected zones in respect of Erwinia amylovora (Burr.) Winsl. et al., whilst other areas should be recognised as protected zones in respect of Erwinia amylovora (Burr.) Winsl. et al. for a further limited period.\n(9) From information supplied by France it appears that some areas within France should not longer be recognised as protected zones in respect of Erwinia amylovora (Burr.) Winsl. et al.\n(10) From information supplied by United Kingdom it appears that the provisional recognition of the protected zone for United Kingdom in respect of beet necrotic yellow vein virus should be extended for a further limited period.\n(11) It is therefore necessary to modify the existing designation of protected zones. In the interest of clarity, a new list of such zones should be adopted. Directive 92/76/EEC should therefore be repealed.

whereas under those quotas the customs duty is limited to 6 % ad valorem; whereas those quotas are to be opened on a multiannual basis and administered by the Commission;\nWhereas it is necessary to maintain a system of administration which ensures that only products originating in the Republic of Indonesia and the People's Republic of China can be imported under the quotas allocated to those countries; whereas, as a result, the issue of import licences should continue to be subject to the presentation of export licences issued by the authorities of those two countries, specimens of which have been sent to the Commission; whereas, as regards products originating in Vietnam, in accordance with the practice followed for several years, import licence applications are subject, in addition to other provisions, to presentation of a certificate issued on the initiative of the exporting country;\nWhereas, since imports of the products concerned into the Community have traditionally been administered on a calendar-year basis, that system should be maintained;\nWhereas imports of products covered by CN codes 0714 10 91, 0714 10 99, 0714 90 11 and 0714 90 19 are subject to presentation of an import licence for which common detailed rules of application are laid down in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3719/88 (2), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2350/96 (3); whereas Commission Regulation (EC) No 1162/95 (4), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1527/96 (5), lays down special detailed rules for the application of the system of licences for cereals and rice;\nWhereas the usual additional rules for the management of such quotas, relating in particular to the submission of applications, issue of licences, and monitoring of imports should be applied;\nWhereas, in particular, the origin of the products should be ascertained by providing that the issue of import licences be subject to the presentation of certificates of origin issued by the countries concerned; whereas, however, certificates of origin should not be required for products originating in the People's Republic of China;\nWhereas, for the sake of sound management of the import arrangements in question, applications for licences may not cover a quantity in excess of that entered on the document certifying loading and shipment to the Community; whereas a maximum quantity per application should also be laid down in certain cases, and it should be stipulated that in no case may applications cover a quantity greater than that for which the aforementioned proof is provided;\nWhereas, in cases where the quantities actually unloaded are slightly in excess of the quantities given in the import licences, measures to ensure the release for free circulation of the surplus quantities should be adopted if the country of origin of the products is able to guarantee that the formalities needed for this purpose can be executed;

Export licences shall be duly authenticated where they indicate the date of issue and bear the stamp of the issuing authority and the signature of the persons authorized to sign them.\nTITLE III\nImport licences\nArticle 6\nLicence applications and licences shall indicate:\n(a) in Section 8, the third country in which the product concerned originates.\nImportation from that country shall be obligatory;\n(b) in Section 24, one of the following entries:\n- Derechos de aduana limitados al 6 % ad valorem [Reglamento (CE) n° 2449/96]\n- Toldsatsen begrænses til 6 % af værdien (Forordning (EF) nr. 2449/96)\n- Beschränkung des Zolls auf 6 % des Zollwerts (Verordnung (EG) Nr. 2449/96)\n- Ôåëùíåéáêüò äáóìüò êáô' áíþôáôï üñéï 6 % êáô' áîßá [Êáíïíéóìüò (ÅÊ) áñéè. 2449/96]\n- Customs duties limited to 6 % ad valorem (Regulation (EC) No 2449/96)\n- Droits de douane limités à 6 % ad valorem [Règlement (CE) n° 2449/96]\n- Dazi doganali limitati al 6 % ad valorem [Regolamento (CE) n. 2449/96]\n- Douanerechten beperkt tot 6 % ad valorem (Verordening (EG) nr. 2449/96)\n- Direitos aduaneiros limitados a 6 % ad valorem [Regulamento (CE) nº 2449/96]\n- Arvotulli rajoitettu 6 prosenttiin (asetus (EY) N:o 2449/96)\n- Tullsatsen begränsad till 6 % av värdet (Förordning (EG) nr 2449/96).\n(c) in Section 20, the name of the vessel in which the goods are being or have been shipped to the Community, the number of the certificate of origin submitted and, in the case of products originating in Indonesia or China, the number and date of the Indonesian or Chinese export licence respectively.\nArticle 7\n1. Notwithstanding Article 10 of Regulation (EC) No 1162/95, the security against import licences shall be ECU 20 per tonne.\nHowever, in the case of products originating in the People's Republic of China, the security shall be ECU 5 per tonne.\n2. If, pursuant to Article 8 (4), the quantity in respect of which the licence is issued is less than the quantity in respect of which it was applied for, the security corresponding to the difference shall be released.\n3. The fourth indent of Article 5 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 3719/88 shall not apply.\nArticle 8\n1. Licence applications shall be lodged with the competent authorities of the Member States between Monday and Wednesday each week, up to 13.00.\nHowever, the first day each year for lodging applications shall be the first working day in January.\n2.

Pending their preparation, the surplus quantities may not be released for free circulation as long as the new import licences for the quantities in question cannot be presented. The new import licences shall be issued under the terms laid down in Article 8.\n2. However, notwithstanding paragraph 1, where the quantities unloaded are not more than 2 % in excess of the quantities covered by the import licences issued corresponding to the export licences granted for the vessel concerned, the competent authorities in the Member State where release for free circulation is to take place shall, at the request of the importer, authorize the release for free circulation of the excess quantities provided that the importer pays a customs duty limited to 6 % ad valorem and lodges a security for an amount equal to the difference between the full duty and that paid.\nThe Commission, on receipt of the information referred to in the first subparagraph of paragraph 1, shall contact the Indonesian authorities with a view to the issue of new export licences.\nSecurities shall be released on presentation to the competent authorities of the Member State in which release for free circulation is to take place of a supplementary import licence for the excess quantity in question.

The study has been developed together with stakeholders and interested parties from the EU and third countries, and the results have been made publicly available.\n(4)\nIt has been stated in the preparatory study that standby functionalities and off-mode losses occur for the majority of electrical and electronic household and office equipment products sold in the Community, while the annual electricity consumption related to standby functionalities and off-mode losses in the Community has been estimated to be 47 TWh in 2005, corresponding to 19 Mt CO2 emissions. Without taking specific measures, the consumption is predicted to increase to 49 TWh in 2020. It has been concluded that the electricity consumption of standby functionalities and off-mode losses can be significantly reduced.\n(5)\nImprovements of electricity consumption of standby functionalities and off-mode losses should be achieved by applying existing non-proprietary cost-effective technologies, which lead to a reduction of the combined expenses for purchasing and operating equipment.\n(6)\nEcodesign requirements for the power consumption of standby mode and off mode of electrical and electronic household and office equipment should be set with a view to harmonising ecodesign requirements on standby mode and off mode throughout the Community and contributing to the functioning of the internal market and to improvement of the environmental performance of the products affected.\n(7)\nThe ecodesign requirements should not have negative impact on the functionality of the product and should not affect negatively health, safety and environment. In particular, the benefits of reducing the electricity consumption during the use phase should over-compensate potential additional environmental impacts during the production phase of equipment having standby functionalities and/or off-mode losses.\n(8)\nThe application of this Regulation should be limited to products corresponding to household and office equipment intended for use in the domestic environment, which, for information technology equipment, corresponds to class B equipment as set out in EN 55022:2006. The scope should be defined such that equipment that is not yet available on the market, but have similar functionalities to those products explicitly named in this Regulation, are designed to fulfil the requirements. When appropriate, an amendment to this Regulation can complement the list of products.\n(9)\nOperating modes not covered by this Regulation, such as the ACPI S3 mode of computers, should be considered in product-specific implementing measures pursuant to Directive 2005/32/EC.\n(10)\nAs a general rule, requirements on standby and off mode set out in product-specific implementing measures pursuant to Directive 2005/32/EC should not be less ambitious than those set out in this Regulation.\n(11)\nIn order to prevent unnecessary losses of energy, products should ideally enter into a ‘0-Watt’ consumption state when providing no function. The technical feasibility and appropriateness should be considered on a product-by-product basis in the relevant implementing measure pursuant to Directive 2005/32/EC.\n(12)\nThe two-staged entry into force of the ecodesign requirements should provide an appropriate time-frame for manufacturers to redesign products as far as standby functionalities and off-mode losses are concerned. The timing of the stages should be set in such a way that negative impacts related to functionalities of equipment on the market are avoided, and cost impacts for manufacturers, in particular SMEs, are taken into account, while ensuring timely achievement of policy objectives. Measurements of the power consumption should be performed taking into account the generally recognised state of the art; manufacturers may apply harmonised standards in accordance with Article 9 of Directive 2005/32/EC.\n(13)\nThis Regulation should increase the market penetration of technologies yielding improved energy efficiency for standby functionalities and off-mode losses, leading to estimated energy savings of 35 TWh in 2020, compared to a business-as-usual scenario.\n(14)\nPursuant to Article 8(2) of Directive 2005/32/EC, this Regulation should specify that the applicable conformity assessment procedures are the internal design control set out in Annex IV and the management system set out in Annex V to Directive 2005/32/EC.\n(15)\nIn order to facilitate compliance checks, manufacturers should be requested to provide information in the technical documentation referred to in Annexes IV and V to Directive 2005/32/EC on the operating conditions subject to the definitions of standby/off mode, and the corresponding power consumption levels.\n(16)\nBenchmarks for currently available technologies with low standby and off mode power consumption should be identified. This helps to ensure wide availability and easy access to information, in particular for SMEs and very small firms, which further facilitates the integration of best-design technologies for reducing the energy consumption of standby and off mode.\n(17)\nThe measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established by Article 19(1) of Directive 2005/32/EC,\nHAS ADOPTED THE FOLLOWING REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nSubject matter and scope\nThis Regulation establishes ecodesign requirements related to standby and off mode electric power consumption.

(the pine wood nematode) in Portugal\n(notified under document number C(2008) 3312)\n(2008/489/EC)\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,\nHaving regard to Council Directive 2000/29/EC of 8 May 2000 on protective measures against the introduction into the Community of organisms harmful to plants or plant products and against their spread within the Community (1), and in particular Article 16(5) thereof,\nWhereas:\n(1)\nIn accordance with Commission Decision 2006/133/EC of 13 February 2006 requiring Member States temporarily to take additional measures against the dissemination of Bursaphelenchus xylophilus (Steiner et Buhrer) Nickle et al. (the pine wood nematode - PWN) as regards areas in Portugal, other than those in which it is known not to occur (2), Portugal is implementing an eradication plan against the dissemination of the pine wood nematode.\n(2)\nPortugal has adopted a ministerial order (Portaria No 358/2008 of 12 May 2008) prohibiting movement of susceptible wood and plants out of continental Portugal unless the wood has been heat treated and the plants duly inspected.\n(3)\nPortugal presented to the Commission a proposal for a survey plan, as provided for in the second paragraph of Article 4 of Decision 2006/133/EC, for the entire Portuguese territory. The proposal was discussed in the Standing Committee on Plant Health on 26 and 27 May 2008. However, the Commission, based on the conclusions of the Committee, did not approve the plan because of insufficient intensity of monitoring.\n(4)\nPortugal informed the Commission on 5 June 2008 on the finding of new outbreaks of PWN, as a result of an extraordinary investigation by the Portuguese authorities in addition to the annual survey, in the part of Portugal where so far PWN was known not to occur.\n(5)\nThe inspection mission from the Food and Veterinary Office from 2 to 6 June 2008 revealed that the data available are not sufficient to confirm that there are areas in Portugal which are free from PWN. Moreover, the Community and national measures are not fully implemented.\n(6)\nTherefore, the measures taken so far are considered to be inadequate and immediate risk of spread of PWN out of Portugal on account of movements of susceptible wood, bark and plants cannot be excluded any longer. Moreover, at present Member States other than Portugal should, as soon as possible, be allowed to control movements into their territory of susceptible wood, bark and plants originating in all parts of Portugal.\n(7)\nAs a consequence of the recent increase of the outbreaks of PWN in Portugal measures should be taken, as soon as possible, to safeguard the territory of other Member States against PWN and to protect the Community trade interests in relation to third countries. The movements of susceptible wood, bark and plants from Portugal to other Member States and third countries should be prohibited unless this material has undergone appropriate treatment or, for plants, appropriate inspection. Therefore, the requirements for movements of susceptible wood, bark and plants from demarcated areas into areas in Portugal, other than demarcated areas, or into other Member States should be extended to all movements from Portugal into other Member States and third countries. Traceability should be ensured by attaching the plant passport or the mark to each unit within a consignment. The scope of control activities carried out by Member States should be widened to allow control of susceptible wood, bark and plants moved from Portugal into their territory.\n(8)\nPending the meeting of the Standing Committee on Plant Health, interim protective measures should be taken to inhibit the spread of PWN from Portugal to other Member States and third countries.\n(9)\nThe measures provided for in this Decision will be reviewed by the Standing Committee on Plant Health,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\nArticle 1\n1. Portugal shall ensure that the conditions set out in the Annex in relation to susceptible wood, bark and plants which are to be moved from its territory to other Member States or third countries are met.\n2. Member States of destination other than Portugal may subject consignments of susceptible wood, bark and plants, coming from Portugal and moved into their territory, to testing for the presence of Bursaphelenchus xylophilus (Steiner et Buhrer) Nickle et al. (the pine wood nematode - PWN).\n3. This Decision is without prejudice to Decision 2006/133/EC.\nArticle 2\nThis Decision is addressed to the Member States.\nDone at Brussels, 27 June 2008.",

whereas in accordance with the spirit of that Resolution, an alternative scheme for tonnage-based fees should be provided for consisting in a percentage differential from the normal tariff, so that the average difference will be at least the same as that which is envisaged by the Resolution; whereas it should furthermore be ensured that segregated ballast oil tankers are always given no less favourable treatment even where fees are not caculated on the basis of tonnage,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nPort and harbour authorities and pilotage authorities within the Community shall, in accordance with the provisions of this Regulation:\n(a) implement within the Community IMO Resolution A.747(18) on the application of tonnage measurements of segregated ballast tanks in oil tankers, adopted by the Assembly of the Intenational Maritime Organization (IMO) on 4 November 1993, whose Annex is contained in Annex I to this Regulation, in order to encourage the use of oil tankers with segregated ballast tanks, including double hull oil tankers and oil tankers of an alternative design; or\n(b) apply reduction schemes for levies charged on segregated ballast oil tankers different from, but in the spirit of, IMO Resolution A.747(18).\nArticle 2\nThis Regulation shall apply to oil tankers which:\n- can carry segregated ballast in specially appointed tanks,\n- are designed, built adapted, equipped and operated as segregated ballast oil tankers including double hull oil tankers and oil tankers of an alternative design,\n- meet the requirements of the International Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships 1969, and\n- hold the International Tonnage Certificate, (1969).\nArticle 3\n1. For the purpose of this Regulation:\n(a) 'oil tanker' means a ship which complies with the definition of an oil tanker in Regulation 1 (4) of Annex I to Marpol 73/78;\n(b) 'segregated ballast' means the ballast which complies with the definition of segregated ballast in Regulation 1 (17) in Annex I to Marpol 73/78;\n(c) 'segregated ballast tank' means a tank exclusively used for the carriage of segregated ballast;\n(d) 'segreagated ballast oil tanker' means an oil tanker provided with segregated ballast tanks and certified by the government of the flag State or by other bodies entitled to do so on its behalf as an oil tanker provided with segregated ballast tanks. This compliance must be clearly stated by such authority in the relevant paragraph of the supplement to the International Oil Pollution Prevention Certificate;\n(e) 'double hull oil tanker' means a segregated ballast oil tanker built in accordance with the requirements laid down in Regulation 13F (3) of Annex I to Marpol 73/78;\n(f) 'oil tanker of an alternative design' means a segregated ballast oil tanker built in accordance with the requirements laid down in Regulation 13 F (4) and (5) of Annex I to Marpol 73/78;\n(g) 'Marpol 73/78' means the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973, as modified by the Protocol of 1978 relating thereto together with the amendments thereto in force at the date of adoption of this Regulation;\n(h) 'port and harbour authority' is a public or private person which charges fees to ships for providing facilities and services to shipping;\n(i) 'pilotage authority' is a public or private person entitled to render pilotage services to shipping;\n(j) 'gross tonnage' means the measure of the overall size of a ship determined in accordance with the provisions of the International Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships, 1969;\n(k) 'reduced gross tonnage' is the gross tonnage of an oil tanker arrived at when the gross tonnage of the segregated ballast tanks, as determined in accordance with the formula given in paragraph 4 of Annex I to this Regulation is deducted from the entire gross tonnage of the vessel.\n2. Annex II contains the defintions given by Marpol 73/78 to the terms in paragraph 1 (a), (b), (e) and (f).\nArticle 4\nWhen issuing the International Tonnage Certificate (1969) for a segregated ballast oil tanker, which has been measured in accordance with the rules of the International Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships, 1969, the competent body shall insert, for the purpose of this Regulation, under the heading 'Remarks' a statement conforming to paragraph 3 of Annex I to this Regulation and specifying:\n(i) the tonnage of the segregated ballast tanks of the ship; this tonnage shall be calculated in accordance with the method and the procedure set out in paragraph 4 of Annex I to this Regulation; and\n(ii) the reduced gross tonnage of the vessel.\nArticle 5\n1. When assessing fees for oil tankers fully or partly based on the figure of gross tonnage (GT) of the vessel, port and harbour authorities and pilotage authorities shall exclude the tonnage of the segregated ballast tanks of an oil tanker, so as to base their calculations on the reduced gross tonnage indicated under the heading 'Remarks' of the International Tonnage Certificate (1969) of the vessel.\n2. Alternatively, port and harbour authorities and pilotage authorities shall ensure that the fee for an oil tanker falling within the scope of this Regulation as provided for in Article 2 is at least 17 % lower than the fee for a tanker without segregated ballast tanks of the same gross tonnage.\nPort and harbour authorities and pilotage authorities already applying, on 13 June 1994, a flat rate system as provided for in the first subparagraph, but based on a lower percentage, shall apply the figure of 17 % as a minimum not later than 1 January 1997.\n3. Where the fees are assessed other than on the basis of gross tonnage, port and harbour authorities as well as pilotage authorities shall ensure that segregated ballast oil tankers receive treatment no less favourable than when fees are calculated in accordance with paragraphs 1 or 2.\n4. Port and harbour authorities and pilotage authorities shall apply, for all segregated ballast oil tankers, only one of the systems mentioned in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3.\nArticle 6\nAnnex I to this Regulation may be amended in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 7 in order to take into account amendments to Resolution A.747(18) of the IMO and to relevant international Conventions which have entered into force.\nArticle 7\n1. The Commission shall be assisted by a committee composed of the representatives of the Member States and chaired by the representative of the Commission. This committee shall be called by the Commission whenever it is necessary for the application of this Regulation.\n2. The committee shall draw up its rules of procedure.\n3.

PROCEDURE\n(1)\nBy letter dated 2 July 2001, registered as received on 16 July 2001 under number N 475/01, Luxembourg notified the Commission under Article 88(3) of the Treaty of the creation of a compensation fund for the organisation of the electricity market. The notified measure had, however, been de facto implemented on 1 January 2001. The Commission accordingly took the view that the measure could not be considered planned aid within the meaning of Article 88(3) of the Treaty and on 30 July 2001 entered it in the register of non-notified aid under number NN 75/01.\n(2)\nFollowing an exchange of correspondence with the Luxembourg authorities, the Commission notified Luxembourg by letter dated 5 June 2002 of its decision to open the procedure laid down in Article 88(2) of the Treaty in respect of the measure. It also invited Luxembourg to submit its comments and provide any information that might be helpful in assessing the measure within one month from the date of receipt of the letter.\n(3)\nThe Commission’s decision to open the procedure was published in the Official Journal of the European Union (2). The Commission called on interested parties to submit their comments on the measure.\n(4)\nBy letter dated 22 July 2002, registered as received on 26 July 2002, Luxembourg requested an extension of the time limit for sending its comments. The Commission granted the request by letter dated 30 July 2002, fixing the time limit at 5 September 2002.\n(5)\nThe Netherlands sent the Commission its comments on the measure by fax dated 4 December 2002, registered as received on the same day. By letter dated 18 February 2003, the Commission forwarded the Netherlands’ letter to Luxembourg, together with a request that the latter submit its comments within one month. After having sent a reminder on 16 May 2003, the Commission received from Luxembourg by fax dated 28 May 2003, registered as received on the same day, a request for an extension of the time limit for replying.\n(6)\nBy letter dated 4 June 2003, registered as received on 5 June 2003, Luxembourg sent the Commission its comments both on the Commission’s letter of 5 June 2002 and on the comments submitted by the Netherlands. Luxembourg provided additional information by letter dated 3 May 2004, registered as received on 13 May 2004.\n(7)\nA working meeting between Luxembourg and the Commission was held on 25 January 2005.\n(8)\nBy letter dated 31 March 2005, the Commission sent Luxembourg a request for information. The Commission received a reply from Luxembourg by letters dated 20 April and 20 May 2005, registered as received on 27 April and 1 June 2005 respectively.\n(9)\nBy letter dated 22 June 2005, the Commission sent Luxembourg a request for additional information. By letter dated 22 November 2005, registered as received on 23 November 2005, Luxembourg asked for an extension of the time limit for replying, in response to which the Commission, by letter dated 5 December 2005, set the time limit at 31 January 2006. The Commission received a reply from Luxembourg by letters dated 31 January 2006, registered as received on 3 February 2006.\n(10)\nBy letter dated 27 March 2006, the Commission sent Luxembourg a request for additional information. The Commission received a reply from Luxembourg by letter dated 11 April 2006, registered as received on 18 April 2006.\n(11)\nA working meeting between Luxembourg and the Commission was held on 12 December 2006.\n(12)\nBy letter dated 21 November 2007, the Commission sent Luxembourg a request for additional information. By letter dated 6 December 2007, registered as received on 10 December 2007, Luxembourg requested a further extension of the time limit for replying, which request the Commission granted by letter dated 14 December 2007, fixing the time limit at 17 January 2008. The Commission received a reply from Luxembourg by letter dated 28 January 2008, registered as received on 30 January 2008.\n(13)\nA working meeting between Luxembourg and the Commission was held on 27 February 2008.\n(14)\nThe Commission received additional information from Luxembourg by letter dated 19 June 2008, registered as received on 20 June 2008, and by letter registered as received on 12 September 2008.\n2. DESCRIPTION\n2.1. The legislative framework to the compensation mechanism\n2.1.1. The Grand-Ducal Regulation of 30 May 1994 and the electricity market liberalisation process\n(15)\nThe Grand-Ducal Regulation (GDR) of 30 May 1994 (3) concerning the production of electrical energy using renewable energy sources or cogeneration (green electricity) imposed an obligation to purchase green electricity on Cegedel, at that time the sole general distributor of grid electricity in Luxembourg. The scheme involved the production of electricity using hydro, wind and solar energy, biogas and biomass, and cogeneration.\n(16)\nArticle 1 of the 1994 GDR provided that the ‘available quantities of electricity obtained from autoproduction using renewable energy sources or cogeneration shall, at the autoproducer’s request, be acquired by the State of Luxembourg for the account of the public network’. The 1994 GDR also set the prices of such green electricity at a higher level than that of conventionally produced electricity. Green electricity purchase prices were adjusted over time, in particular by the GDR of 14 October 2005 (4). The prices in force on 1 January 2008 were set by the GDR of 8 February 2008 (5) on the production of electricity using renewable energy sources.\n(17)\nLuxembourg has estimated that, in 2000, the purchasing obligation stemming from the 1994 GDR related to a production of 112 GWh (6), and that these volumes were purchased at a price on average some three times higher than the price resulting from the long-term supply contracts concluded by Cegedel. According to the Luxembourg authorities, this resulted in an additional cost of LUF 275 million or EUR 6,8 million.\n(18)\nAfter the electricity sector was opened up to competition by the Law of 24 July 2000 (7), the purchasing obligation was extended to include all distributors operating in Luxembourg. In 2001 these were 13 in number, including the largest, Cegedel, and the second largest, Sotel, both of which supplied the steel plants in the south of the country, and local distributors. In actual fact, however, Cegedel alone purchased the lion’s share of the green electricity produced in Luxembourg.\n2.1.2. The GDR of 22 May 2001\n(19)\nIn order to spread equitably among distributors the burden of the costs resulting from the obligation to acquire green electricity, Luxembourg decided to set up, through the GDR of 22 May 2001 (8) concerning the introduction of a compensation fund for the organisation of the electricity market, a compensation mechanism. The compensation fund became de facto operational on 1 January 2001.\n(20)\nUnder Article 21 of the GDR of 22 May 2001, each electricity distributor in Luxembourg was authorised to collect a contribution to the compensation fund from its final customers. The contribution was proportional to a final customer’s electricity consumption. The compensation fund mechanism made it possible to divide the costs stemming from the green electricity purchasing obligation among all the distributor’s customers. The level of contributions was set each year by the State so that the fund’s income did not exceed the additional cost of purchasing green electricity. Under Article 13 of the GDR of 22 May 2001, large electricity consumers (9) were exempted from paying the contribution until 31 December 2005 (10). According to the Luxembourg authorities, this exemption concerned some 50 large consumers mainly in the chemical and steel industries.\n(21)\nUnder Article 23 of the GDR of 22 May 2001, the contribution for 2001 was set for all non-exempted customers at EUR 2,73/MWh.\n2.1.3. The GDR of 9 December 2005\n(22)\nFollowing bilateral talks with the Commission, the GDR of 9 December 2005 (11), which entered into force on 1 January 2006, amended the GDR of 22 May 2001. It abolished, in particular, the exemption from contribution payments for large electricity consumers and introduced instead three categories of customer, corresponding to three different levels of contribution (12):\n-\ncategory A comprised customers at whose metering points annual electricity consumption was less than or equal to 25 MWh. For 2007, the contribution payable by category A consumers was set at EUR 7,00/MWh,\n-\ncategory B comprised customers at whose metering points annual electricity consumption was greater than 25 MWh, with the exception of metering points classified in category C. For 2007, the contribution payable by category B consumers was set at EUR 2,70/MWh,\n-\ncategory C concerned customers in category B who, in addition, had to ‘commit themselves to achieving a substantial improvement in their overall energy efficiency by agreement to be concluded between the Government and the enterprise concerned […]. The agreement to be concluded will include a penalty clause in case of failure to meet commitments’ (13). All agreements came to an end on 31 January 2008. For 2007, the contribution payable by category C consumers was set at EUR 0,75/MWh.\n2.1.4. Provisions applicable as of 1 January 2009\n(23)\nThe Luxembourg authorities have undertaken to replace the GDR of 9 December 2005 with a new, as yet unpublished GDR, scheduled to enter into force on 1 January 2009. According to the Luxembourg authorities, the new GDR provides that distributors may collect a contribution towards the costs associated with green electricity from their final customers. The level of the contribution is thus no longer set by the public authorities but is left to distributors’ discretion.\n2.2. Operation of the compensation mechanism\n(24)\nFrom a practical standpoint, the GDRs of 22 May 2001 and 9 December 2005 provided that the principal distributor in Luxembourg, Cegedel, the shares in which were majority privately owned, had to purchase all the green electricity produced in Luxembourg at the price set by the State. Cegedel made such purchases either in its own name or on behalf of other distributors who had concluded supply contracts with green electricity producers. It then sold the green electricity to its competitors according to their respective market shares in the Luxembourg market and at a selling price set by the State on the basis of the electricity market price established the previous year. The additional costs associated with green electricity corresponded to the difference between the purchase price paid to producers of such electricity (feed-in tariff) and the selling price charged to other distributors, both of which were set by the State. All distributors reported on their green electricity purchases each month to the Luxembourg energy regulator, the Institut Luxembourgeois de Régulation (ILR). At the end of the year, the regulator performed a compensation operation between distributors: if the share of green electricity produced in Luxembourg and purchased by a distributor was greater than its share of the electricity market, then it received compensation from the fund; conversely, if its share of green electricity purchased was smaller than its share of the domestic market, then it had to pay a corresponding contribution to the fund. The compensation fund was therefore designed to ensure that each distributor active in Luxembourg purchased a share of green electricity produced in Luxembourg that matched its share of the domestic market.\n(25)\nThe diagram below describes the operation of the compensation fund as it was in force until 31 December 2008.\n3. REASONS FOR OPENING THE FORMAL INVESTIGATION PROCEDURE\n(26)\nIn its decision to open the formal investigation procedure, the Commission took the view that the compensation mechanism prima facie constituted State aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) of the Treaty (14).\n(27)\nThe measure conferred an advantage on green electricity producers, who ultimately benefited from the proceeds of the compensation fund. Moreover, the exemption from compensation payments applicable until 31 December 2005 favoured large electricity-consuming enterprises over other enterprises which had to contribute to the compensation fund. On the other hand, distributors enjoyed no advantage as they simply played the part of intermediary in collecting the contributions made by final customers and paid on to green electricity producers.\n(28)\nThis advantage was provided through State resources, not by reason of the introduction of the green electricity purchasing obligation but by reason of the creation of the compensation fund. The latter was set up by the State, was financed by a system of compulsory contributions, and the sums paid into it were controlled by the State.\n(29)\nThe measure was selective in that it favoured only certain enterprises or certain activities, and in particular green electricity producers as opposed to other electricity producers and large electricity-consuming enterprises as opposed to other electricity-consuming enterprises.\n(30)\nLastly, the granting of an advantage to green electricity producers was liable to affect intra-Community trade in electricity and distort competition, as was the advantage enjoyed by large electricity-consuming enterprises, active as these were in various sectors of the economy.\n(31)\nThe Commission then examined the compatibility of the compensation mechanism with the common market under Article 87(3)(c) of the Treaty in the light of the 2001 Community guidelines on State aid for environmental protection (the 2001 guidelines) (15). It expressed the following concerns in this regard.\n(32)\nFirst, the Commission considered that the aid for green electricity producers prima facie did not satisfy the conditions laid down in the following provisions of the 2001 guidelines:\n-\nthe system did not ensure that the aid was limited to the difference between the production cost and the market price of the energy concerned. It did not limit the duration of the operating aid to that necessary to cover plant depreciation. Nor did it take account of any investment aid received by producers for their plants, such as the ecological premium in Luxembourg (16) (point E.3.3.1 of the 2001 guidelines),\n-\nthe system made no provision for a market mechanism such as green certificates (point E.3.3.2 of the 2001 guidelines),\n-\nthe operating aid was not calculated on the basis of the external costs avoided (point E.3.3.3 of the 2001 guidelines),\n-\nthe operating aid was not limited to five years’ duration, it was not degressive, and its intensity was not limited to 50 % of the extra costs (point E.3.3.4 of the 2001 guidelines).\n(33)\nSecondly, the Commission considered that the exemption from contribution payments granted to large electricity-consuming enterprises prima facie did not fulfil the criteria laid down in the 2001 guidelines: exempted enterprises had not undertaken to achieve environmental protection objectives (17); such enterprises were not required to pay a significant proportion of the tax (18); and lastly, the exemptions were not degressive within the meaning of the 2001 guidelines and their intensity was not limited to 50 % (19).\n(34)\nLastly, the Commission questioned the measure’s compatibility with Articles 25 and 90 of the Treaty. The compensation mechanism did not make provision for any exemption from contribution payments for imported electricity or from the tax on exports. The measure ultimately benefited only domestic producers of green electricity. Imported electricity was therefore taxed without ultimately benefiting from the support enjoyed by green electricity produced in Luxembourg.\n(35)\nThe new GDR referred to in paragraph 23, scheduled to enter into force on 1 January 2009, amends the compensation mechanism in such a way that it no longer numbers among the reasons for opening the formal investigation procedure. Consequently, this Decision examines the existence of State aid and the compatibility or otherwise of the compensation mechanism under Article 87(3)(c) of the Treaty up until 31 December 2008.\n4. COMMENTS FROM LUXEMBOURG ON THE OPENING OF THE FORMAL INVESTIGATION PROCEDURE\n4.1. On the description of the measure\n(36)\nLuxembourg pointed out first of all that, under the GDR of 30 May 1994, Cegedel was alone obliged to purchase Luxembourg-produced green electricity. Other, competing distributors had since emerged owing to liberalisation (they were 13 in number in June 2003). They had all been placed under an obligation to purchase green electricity. In actual fact, however, the additional costs still fell largely on one operator, Cegedel. Consequently, the compensation fund in reality promoted fair competition between distributors since it divided among them the additional costs associated with the green electricity purchasing obligation.\n(37)\nLuxembourg pointed out secondly that the measure produced significant environmental benefits and helped to achieve the environmental protection objectives to which Luxembourg has committed itself in accordance with the Community anti-climate change policy: for Luxembourg, the target was to reduce carbon emissions by 28 % compared with 1990. The Luxembourg authorities accordingly called on the Commission to assess the potential competition-distorting effects or the effect on intra-Community trade in the light of the environmental benefits of the measure.\n4.2. On the existence of State aid\n(38)\nLuxembourg considered that the creation of the compensation fund did not constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) of the Treaty.\n(39)\nIt maintained first of all that, as the Court of Justice of the European Communities (the Court of Justice) had found in its judgment in PreussenElektra (20), the fund did not involve any State resources. Before the fund was introduced, the additional costs associated with the green electricity purchasing obligation had been borne exclusively by the final customers of a private company, Cegedel. Since the introduction of the fund, the additional costs had been divided among all customers of all distributors in Luxembourg, without, however, involving more State resources. In support of its argument Luxembourg cited paragraph 66 of the PreussenElektra judgment: ‘a statutory provision of a Member State which, first, requires private electricity supply undertakings to purchase electricity produced in their area of supply from renewable energy sources at minimum prices higher than the real economic value of that type of electricity, and, second, distributes the financial burden resulting from that obligation between those electricity supply undertakings and upstream private electricity network operators, does not constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 92(1) (now Article 87(1)) of the Treaty’.\n(40)\nLuxembourg pointed out secondly that the compensation fund did not create any advantage for green electricity producers inasmuch as there was no contractual or financial link between the fund and the producers. The latter were remunerated directly by the distributors when they purchased green electricity, according to the tariffs set at the time by the GDR of 30 May 1994. The compensation fund, for its part, made compensatory payments only between distributors.\n(41)\nThe compensation fund likewise did not create any advantage for large electricity-consuming enterprises compared with enterprises which contributed to the fund. The beneficiaries of the exemption - the chemical and steel industries - had no competitors in Luxembourg which should have contributed to the fund. Luxembourg considered, moreover, that the beneficiaries of the exemption were not placed at an advantage compared with competitors situated outside of Luxembourg.\n(42)\nLuxembourg considered lastly that the competition-distorting effect and the effect on intra-Community trade associated with the compensation fund were no more than theoretical. In particular, it was not proven that the exemptions from which Luxembourg heavy industry benefited affected trade between Member States.\n4.3. On the infringement of Articles 25 and 90 of the Treaty\n(43)\nLuxembourg considered that the compensation mechanism did not infringe Articles 25 and 90 of the Treaty. According to Luxembourg, the system did not treat electricity produced in Luxembourg any differently from imported electricity. Moreover, green electricity produced in accordance with the GDR of 30 May 1994 was not exported. Therefore, a producer situated in another Member State but having customers in Luxembourg was treated in exactly the same way as a producer situated in Luxembourg and selling in the domestic market. The same was true if the customers of the two producers were situated in another Member State.\n4.4. On the compatibility of potential State aid with the Treaty\n(44)\nAlthough they challenged the assertion that the exemption from contribution payments for large electricity-consuming enterprises constituted State aid, the Luxembourg authorities maintained that the measure might be deemed compatible with the 2001 guidelines.\n(45)\nLuxembourg pointed out that the exemption was granted on the basis of a voluntary agreement comprising energy efficiency improvement objectives for signatory companies. The voluntary agreement had been concluded between Luxembourg and the Fédération Nationale des Industries (National Industries Federation - FEDIL) in March 1996 and renewed in April 2001.\n(46)\nWhile it acknowledged that the agreement did not stipulate any penalties in case of failure to meet commitments, Luxembourg undertook to include such a mechanism in order to bring the agreement into line with point 51.1(a) of the 2001 guidelines.\n5. COMMENTS FROM THIRD PARTIES\n(47)\nOnly the Netherlands submitted comments following the opening of the formal investigation into the Luxembourg compensation mechanism.\n(48)\nThe Netherlands pointed out that aid to domestic green electricity producers was authorised on condition that it did not exceed the unprofitable extra cost of producing such electricity. The Dutch authorities were in favour of compensating fully for such unprofitable extra cost in order to develop green electricity production. Such support was necessary to enable Member States to achieve the environmental objectives to which they had committed themselves by ratifying the Kyoto Protocol (21).\n(49)\nThe Netherlands pointed out further that each Member State had to be left some latitude when it came to achieving the environmental objectives of the Kyoto Protocol. It suggested, therefore, that the Commission should adopt a case-by-case approach to the green electricity support measures taken by each Member State.\n(50)\nIn conclusion, the Netherlands called on the Commission to view the measure proposed by Luxembourg favourably given the current need to further promote green electricity production.\n6. LUXEMBOURG’S RESPONSE TO THE COMMENTS FROM THIRD PARTIES\n(51)\nLuxembourg did not respond to the comments submitted by the Netherlands.\n7. ASSESSMENT\n7.1. Existence of State aid\n(52)\nIn its decision to open the formal investigation procedure, the Commission took the view that the compensation mechanism prima facie constituted State aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) of the Treaty (22). The two categories of beneficiary of this State aid were green electricity producers and, through the exemption from contributing to the compensation fund, large electricity-consuming enterprises.\n(53)\nIn previous decisions, the Commission also took the view that feed-in tariff schemes, financed in a manner similar to the one in the present case, constituted State aid. This was so, for example, in the decisions in Case N 504/2000 (23) (United Kingdom), Joined Cases N 707/02 and N 708/02 (24), prolonged by measure N 543/05 (25) then by measure N 478/07 (26) (Netherlands), Cases NN 162/03 and N 317/06 (27) (Austria) and Case C 7/05 (Slovenia) (28).\n(54)\nIt will be examined below whether the compensation mechanism constituted State aid during the period in question, i.e. up to 31 December 2008.\n7.1.1. Determination of the presence of State resources\n(55)\nAccording to case-law, in order to be capable of being categorised as State aid a measure must, first, be granted directly or indirectly through State resources and, second, be imputable to the State (29).\n(56)\nOn the question of the existence of State resources, the Court of Justice has held that the financial resources of a measure do not necessarily have to constitute permanent assets of the public sector in order for them to be categorised as State resources; in order for such resources to be so categorised, it is sufficient that they constantly remain under public control and therefore available to the competent national authorities (30). Conversely, according to the case-law of the Court of Justice (31), State resources are not involved where the public authorities at no stage enjoy or acquire control over the funds which finance the economic advantage in issue. It must be determined, therefore, whether the State exercised direct or indirect control over the resources in question, despite the fact that the funds did not come directly from the State budget. In the PreussenElektra case, the feed-in tariffs were financed directly by private electricity suppliers who had to purchase electricity from green electricity producers at a price higher than the market price for electricity. In the present case, from January 2001 to December 2008 the State collected from consumers compulsory contributions which were then passed on to green electricity producers via distributors. The compensation fund, which was set up by the Luxembourg State, saw to the allocation of the compensation among distributors. In its judgment in Stardust Marine (32), the Court of Justice held that, once resources came under State control, they remained State resources. The Commission considers, therefore, that the aid was granted directly or indirectly through State resources.\n(57)\nAs regards imputability, the ILR calculated the aid and distributed it to each beneficiary according to a formula laid down by law. The State thus exercised control, through the law, not only over the amounts distributed and the beneficiaries, but also over the granting of the aid. The Commission considers, therefore, that the aid was imputable to the State.\n7.1.2. Selectivity\n(58)\nThe compensation mechanism was directed only at some electricity producers, namely green electricity producers in Luxembourg.\n(59)\nThe mechanism provided for exemption from compensation payments or, as from 1 January 2006, a reduced contribution for one category of consumer only, namely large electricity consumers (33).\n7.1.3. Existence of an advantage\n(60)\nThe compulsory contribution imposed by the compensation mechanism manifestly conferred an advantage on green electricity producers, since the very aim of the scheme was to enable such producers to sell their electricity at a price higher than the market price.\n(61)\nLarge electricity-consuming enterprises manifestly enjoyed an advantage due to the exemption from - or, from 1 January 2006, the reduction in - the contribution to the compensation mechanism.\n7.1.4. Distortion of competition and effect on intra-Community trade\n(62)\nThe measure affected economic operators in sectors open to competition, be they the electricity production sector or sectors in which large electricity-consuming enterprises operate (including chemicals and steel) and which engage in trade with other Member States.\n(63)\nConsequently, the aid was liable to distort competition and affect intra-Community trade.\n7.1.5. Conclusion on the existence of State aid\n(64)\nOn the basis of these elements, the Commission considers that the version of the compensation mechanism that was in place between 1 January 2001 and 31 December 2008 constituted State aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) of the Treaty.\n7.2. Assessment of the compatibility of the aid under Article 87(3)(c) of the Treaty\n(65)\nFor the reasons given in paragraphs 32, 33 and 34, the Commission decided to open a formal investigation procedure in this case as it had doubts about the compatibility of the measure with the common market - a compatibility which also implied its conformity with Articles 25 and 90 of the Treaty.\n(66)\nIn view of the fact that the aid in the form of a compensation mechanism pursued an environmental protection objective, its compatibility must be assessed in the light of the Community guidelines on State aid for environmental protection. Between 1 January 2001 and 31 December 2008, two sets of guidelines were applicable in succession, with the 2001 guidelines being replaced by new Community guidelines on State aid for environmental protection (34) (the 2008 guidelines). Inasmuch as the aid at issue was registered as non-notified aid, its compatibility must, in accordance with point 205 of the 2008 guidelines, be assessed in the light of the rules applicable when the aid was granted.\n(67)\nIt is necessary therefore to assess, firstly, the measure’s compatibility in the light of the 2001 and 2008 guidelines and, secondly, its conformity with Articles 25 and 90 of the Treaty.\n7.3. Compatibility of the aid in the light of the 2001 and 2008 guidelines\n(68)\nThe Commission has assessed the compatibility of the aid, during the period from 1 January 2001 to 31 December 2008, with respect to two types of beneficiary: on the one hand, green electricity producers, which benefited indirectly from contributions to the compensation fund, and, on the other, large electricity-consuming enterprises, which benefited first from exemption from, then - from 1 January 2006 onwards - from a reduction in, contributions to the compensation fund.\n7.3.1. Compatibility of the aid to green electricity producers in Luxembourg\n(69)\nThe aid granted to green electricity producers through the compulsory contribution included in the compensation mechanism concerned certain renewable energy sources (hydro, solar and wind power, biomass and biogas) and cogeneration, covered by the 2001 and 2008 guidelines (35).\n(70)\nThe Luxembourg authorities have submitted to the Commission two reports produced by the research institute […] (36) (37) analysing the levels of compensation granted to green electricity producers in Luxembourg. The first report covers the period to the end of 2005 (38) and the second the period from 2006 to 2008 (39).\n(71)\nThe calculations relate to all the renewable energy sources eligible under the compensation mechanism (40), and concern also cogeneration. Besides feed-in tariffs, they take account of other support schemes, operating aid (notably the ecological premium (41)) and investment aid. The calculations compare the cost of producing green electricity and the market price for such electricity. The reports conclude that there was no over-compensation during the periods concerned, either in the case of renewables or in that of cogeneration.\n(72)\nOn the basis of these elements, the Commission considers that the aid was limited to the difference between the cost of producing green electricity and the electricity market price.\n(73)\nFor the period from 1 January 2001 to 1 April 2008, during which the 2001 guidelines were applicable, the Commission considers therefore that the aid granted to green electricity producers was in keeping with the 2001 guidelines, and in particular points 58 to 60 thereof concerning operating aid, and that it was accordingly compatible within the meaning of Article 87(3)(c) of the Treaty.\n(74)\nFor the period from 2 April 2008 to 31 December 2008, during which the 2008 guidelines were applicable, the Commission considers that the aid granted to green electricity producers was in keeping with the 2008 guidelines, and in particular points 109 and 119 thereof concerning operating aid for renewable energy sources and cogeneration (42), and that this aid was accordingly compatible within the meaning of Article 87(3)(c) of the Treaty.\n7.3.2. Compatibility of the aid to large electricity-consuming enterprises\n(75)\nIn its decision to open the formal investigation procedure, the Commission expressed doubts about the compatibility of the exemption from contribution payments enjoyed by large electricity-consuming enterprises up until 31 December 2005. As from 1 January 2006, such enterprises contributed to the compensation fund, albeit at a reduced rate.\n(76)\nAs to the determination of the rules applicable to assessing the aid’s compatibility, it should be noted that the contribution for 2008 was calculated on the basis of data for 2007, and that the decision to grant the aid was taken before 2 April 2008, the date on which the 2008 guidelines entered into force. Consequently, for the whole of the period from 1 January 2001 to 31 December 2008, the compatibility of the aid granted to large electricity-consuming enterprises falls to be assessed in the light of the 2001 guidelines.\n(77)\nThe Luxembourg authorities have made clear first of all that all exempted large electricity-consuming enterprises undertook to improve their energy efficiency under voluntary agreements concluded with the State in 1996, then in 2002, covering the period from 2000 to 2006. Luxembourg amended these agreements, moreover, on 13 April 2005 at the Commission’s request.\n(78)\nThe main amendments, which entered into force with the GDR of 9 December 2005, consisted of the inclusion of an energy efficiency improvement target for signatory enterprises: in 2005, energy efficiency had to be improved by 15 % compared with 1990. In addition, penalties were introduced into the agreement in case of failure to meet commitments:\n-\nenterprises which did not meet their commitments had to purchase a certain quantity of green electricity on the market or produce it for their own consumption (43),\n-\nenterprises which did not meet their commitments to have the improvement in their energy efficiency certified by auditors at the beginning and end of the period had to purchase or produce themselves volumes of green electricity representing 1 % of their consumption.\n(79)\nMoreover, the exemption from contribution payments was created at the same time as the contribution to the compensation fund itself, on 1 January 2001.\n(80)\nOn the basis of the elements outlined in paragraphs 77, 78 and 79, the Commission considers that the exemption from, then - from 1 January 2006 - the reduction in, contributions to the compensation fund for large electricity-consuming enterprises in exchange for the conclusion of voluntary agreements was in keeping with point 51.1(a) of the 2001 guidelines. Consequently, the measure was compatible within the meaning of Article 87(3)(c), as from December 2005.\n(81)\nFor the period from January 2001 to December 2005, the Commission notes that the exemption from contribution payments was also obtained in exchange for energy efficiency improvement commitments by large electricity-consuming enterprises. These agreements, which were first concluded in 1996, were renewed in 2002 for the period between 2000 and 2006. Moreover, the penalties introduced in 2005 applied if enterprises had not improved their energy efficiency in 2005 by 15 % compared with 1990. The Commission considers, therefore, that the environmental target and the penalties applied to the conduct of the beneficiaries of the exemption between 2001 and 2005. Consequently, the Commission considers that the exemption from contribution payments for large electricity-consuming enterprises between January 2001 and December 2005 was in keeping with point 51.1(a) of the 2001 guidelines and that it was therefore compatible within the meaning of Article 87(3)(c) of the Treaty.\n7.4. Conformity of the aid with Articles 25 and 90 of the Treaty\n(82)\nFor the period from 1 January 2001 to 31 December 2008, the additional costs associated with the green electricity purchasing obligation were ultimately borne by consumers on the basis of their consumption. According to the settled case-law of the Court of Justice, recently confirmed by the judgment in Essent (44), such a compulsory contribution imposed on final consumers constitutes a parafiscal levy, and the conformity of its financing mechanism with the Treaty falls to be examined by the Commission (45). The Commission also adopted a similar approach in the decisions cited in paragraph 53.\n(83)\nAs regards the risk of imported green electricity being discriminated against compared with green electricity produced in Luxembourg, which alone benefits from the revenue from contributions, the Luxembourg authorities have undertaken, by a ministerial letter, to set up a procedure for reimbursing contributions to the fund for green electricity imported up until 31 December 2008. To benefit therefrom, consumers will have to prove that they have purchased imported green electricity.\n(84)\n[…]\n(85)\n[…] (46)\n(86)\n[…]\n(87)\nOn the basis of these elements, the system in place in Luxembourg appears very similar to the reimbursement procedures in place in Austria, which have been declared compatible by the Commission (47).\n8. CONCLUSION\n(88)\nThe Commission finds that Luxembourg unlawfully implemented the measure of creating a compensation fund for the organisation of the electricity market, in infringement of Article 88(3) of the Treaty.\n(89)\nHowever, in the light of all the above elements, the Commission concludes that, for the period from January 2001 to December 2008, the aid granted to green electricity producers in Luxembourg and the exemption from, then - from 1 January 2006 - the reduction in, contributions for large electricity-consuming enterprises, constitute aid compatible under Article 87(3)(c) of the Treaty, as stated in the 2001 and 2008 guidelines,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\nArticle 1\nThe creation and administration, between 1 January 2001 and 31 December 2008, by Luxembourg of a compensation fund for the organisation of the electricity market constituted State aid under Article 87(1) of the Treaty for green electricity producers in Luxembourg and for large electricity-consuming enterprises.\nThe aid was compatible with the common market under Article 87(3)(c) of the Treaty.\nArticle 2\nThis Decision shall be valid subject to amendment of the compensation mechanism, such as Luxembourg has undertaken to provide in its legislation.\nArticle 3\nThis Decision is addressed to the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.\nDone at Brussels, 28 January 2009.",

Provisions concerning summer time should therefore be laid down for an unspecified period. Article 4 of Directive 97/44/EC provides, in that respect, that the European Parliament and the Council are to adopt, by 1 January 2001, the arrangements to apply from 2002 onwards.\n(5) For reasons of clarity and accuracy of information, a timetable for the implementation of the summer-time period for the following five years should be published every five years.\n(6) Implementation of this Directive should, moreover, be monitored by means of a report, to be presented by the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council and the Economic and Social Committee, on the impact of these provisions in all of the areas concerned. That report should be based on the information made available to the Commission by the Member States in sufficient time to enable the report to be presented at the specified time.\n(7) Given that the complete harmonisation of the timetable for the summer-time period with a view to facilitating transport and communications cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore be better achieved at Community level, the Community may take measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. This Directive does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve those objectives.\n(8) For geographical reasons, the common summer-time arrangements should not apply to the overseas territories of the Member States,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nArticle 1\nFor the purposes of this Directive \"summer-time period\" shall mean the period of the year during which clocks are put forward by 60 minutes compared with the rest of the year.\nArticle 2\nFrom 2002 onwards, the summer-time period shall begin, in every Member State, at 1.00 a.m., Greenwich Mean Time, on the last Sunday in March.\nArticle 3\nFrom 2002 onwards, the summer-time period shall end, in every Member State, at 1.00 a.m., Greenwich Mean Time, on the last Sunday in October.\nArticle 4\nThe Commission shall publish a communication in the Official Journal of the European Communities(5), for the first time on the occasion of the publication of this Directive, and every five years thereafter, containing the timetable showing the dates on which the summer-time period will begin and end for the following five years.\nArticle 5\nThe Commission shall report to the European Parliament, the Council and the Economic and Social Committee on the impact of the provisions of this Directive on the sectors concerned by 31 December 2007 at the latest.\nThat report shall be drawn up on the basis of the information made available to the Commission by each Member State by 30 April 2007 at the latest.\nThe Commission shall, if necessary and following the conclusions of the report, make appropriate proposals.\nArticle 6\nThis Directive shall not apply to the overseas territories of the Member States.\nArticle 7\nMember States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 31 December 2001 at the latest. They shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof.\nWhen Member States adopt those measures, they shall contain a reference to this Directive or be accompanied by such a reference on the occasion of their official publication.

This results in outgoings on removals, transport, etc.,;\nWhereas the United Kingdom Government is to contribute £ 15,1 million towards such costs borne by the NCB in 1984/85;\nWhereas the purpose and form of the aid show that it meets the criteria set out in Article 8 of the Decision;\nWhereas the aid given to cover losses on mining (£ 513,2 million) will largely cover the losses sustained by NCB pits in 1984/85. The aid is given, in principle (i.e. independently of the miners' strike) to avoid serious economic and social problems in those coalfields where there are not yet adequate re-employment opportunities and to maintain existing production capacities so as to safeguard energy supplies. The aid is therefore compatible with Article 12 of the Decision;\nII\nWhereas, under Article 3 (2) of the Decision, an examination of the compatibility of the abovementioned aids with the proper functioning of the common market must also extend to all other financial measures to support current production in the 1984/85 financial year;\nWhereas aids for current production in the United Kingdom will amount to 910,8 million ECU or 18,22 ECU per tonne for the 1984/85 financial year; whereas the current production in the United Kingdom is more heavily subsidized (per tonne) than in the Federal Republic of Germany and substantially less than in France and Belgium;\nWhereas an examination of the compatibility of these aids with the proper functioning of the common market requires no detailed information or investigation:\n- in spite of the strike of the British miners, there were no supply difficulties on the British market in 1984/85,\n- figures of deliveries of United Kingdom coal in intra-Community trade are not yet available for 1984,\n- the closure of several unprofitable pits resulted in rationalization and concentration of production on pits where productivity is highest,\n- industrial consumers of coal did not receive indirect aids in 1984/85 as a result of the prices of British coking coal and steam coal;\nWhereas it can therefore be stated that the aids for the British coal industry for current production in the 1984/85 financial year are compatible with the proper functioning of the common market;\nWhereas this also applies when account is taken of aids to the coal industry pursuant to Decision 73/287/ECSC (1);\nIII\nWhereas on 6 September 1984 the Commission of the European Communities adopted Decision 84/456/ECSC (2); whereas that Decision authorized the aids which the United Kingdom Government proposed to grant to the coal industry during the 1983/84 financial year provided they had been dealt with and examined by the Commission in the 'Memorandum on the financial aids granted by the Member States to the coal industry in 1983 and on the additional financial aids granted by the Member States to the coal industry in 1982' (3);\nWhereas, as was stated in that memorandum, the United Kingdom Government proposed to grant £ 431 900 000 of aid under Decision No 528/76/ECSC to the British coal-mining industry;\nWhereas, in addition, the United Kingdom Government in a written application dated 5 September 1984 requested permission to alter or to increase the aids originally proposed as follows:\n(£ million)\n1.2.3.4 // // // // // // Original amount // Additional amount // New amount // // // // // Cover for coalfields' operating losses // 415,0 // + 453,0 // 868,0 // Per tonne of production in pounds sterling // 3,57 // // 7,46 // // // //\nWhereas the overall amount of aid to current production in the British coal-mining industry during the 1983/84 financial year is thus increased by £ 453 000 000. It proved necessary to double the United Kingdom aid to cover pit operating losses since these were greater in the 1983/84 coal marketing year than had been originally expected. According to the information available to the Commission on the actual position of costs and returns in 1983, the loss per tonne rose considerably more than had been estimated. The increase in aid does not completely cover the pit operating losses for 1983; this measure is thus compatible with provisions of Article 12 (1) (1) of the Decision;\nIV\nWhereas the following remarks must be made in respect of the compatibility of the total amount of British aids to support current production (1 492 400 000 ECU or 12,82 ECU per tonne) with the proper functioning of the common market:\n- there has been no decline in trade in coal between the United Kingdom and the other Community countries,\n- industrial users of coking coal and steel coal did not receive aids as a result of artificially low prices of British coal;\nWhereas it may therefore be concluded that the additional aids proposed during the 1983/84 financial year for current production in the British coal-mining industry are compatible with the proper functioning of the common market.\nV\nWhereas, pursuant to Article 14 (1) of the Decision, the Commission must ascertain that aids authorized are used exclusively for the purposes set out in Articles 7 to 12 thereof; whereas the Commission must be informed in particular of the amount of these aids and the manner in which they are apportioned,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\nArticle 1\nThe United Kingdom is hereby authorized in respect of the 1984/85 financial year to grant aids totalling £ 528 300 000 to the British coal-mining industry.\nThe said aids are made up as follows:\n1. Grant to cover the costs incurred by the National Coal Board in respect of relocation of personnel under the production rationalization programme, not exceeding £ 15 100 000.\n2. Aid to cover losses on mining not exceeding £ 513 200 000.\nThe United Kingdom is hereby authorized in respect of the 1983/84 financial year to grant an additional aid to cover losses on coal-mining industry not exceeding £ 453 000 000.\nArticle 2\nThe United Kingdom shall notify the Commission by 30 September 1985 of details of the aids granted pursuant to this Decision, and in particular of the amounts paid and the manner in which they are apportioned.\nArticle 3\nThis Decision is addressed to the United Kingdom.\nDone at Brussels, 24 July 1985.",

            "text": "DIRECTIVE 2004/107/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 15 December 2004\nrelating to arsenic, cadmium, mercury, nickel and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in ambient air\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 175(1) thereof,\nHaving regard to the proposal from the Commission,\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),\nAfter consulting the Committee of the Regions,\nActing in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty (2),\nWhereas:\n(1)\nOn the basis of principles enshrined in Article 175(3) of the Treaty, the Sixth Community Environment Action Programme, adopted by Decision No 1600/2002/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (3), establishes the need to reduce pollution to levels which minimise harmful effects on human health, paying particular attention to sensitive populations, and the environment as a whole, to improve the monitoring and assessment of air quality including the deposition of pollutants and to provide information to the public.\n(2)\nArticle 4(1) of Council Directive 96/62/EC of 27 September 1996 on ambient air quality assessment and management (4) requires the Commission to submit proposals for regulating the pollutants listed in Annex I to that Directive taking into account the provisions laid down in paragraphs 3 and 4 of that Article.\n(3)\nScientific evidence shows that arsenic, cadmium, nickel and some polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are human genotoxic carcinogens and that there is no identifiable threshold below which these substances do not pose a risk to human health. Impact on human health and the environment occurs via concentrations in ambient air and via deposition. With a view to cost-effectiveness, ambient air concentrations of arsenic, cadmium, nickel and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which would not pose a significant risk to human health, cannot be achieved in specific areas.\n(4)\nWith the aim of minimising harmful effects on human health, paying particular attention to sensitive populations, and the environment as a whole, of airborne arsenic, cadmium and nickel and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, target values should be set, to be attained as far as possible. Benzo(a)pyrene should be used as a marker for the carcinogenic risk of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in ambient air.\n(5)\nThe target values would not require any measures entailing disproportionate costs. Regarding industrial installations, they would not involve measures beyond the application of best available techniques (BAT) as required by Council Directive 96/61/EC of 24 September 1996 concerning integrated pollution prevention and control (5) and in particular would not lead to the closure of installations. However, they would require Member States to take all cost-effective abatement measures in the relevant sectors.\n(6)\nIn particular, the target values of this Directive are not to be considered as environmental quality standards as defined in Article 2(7) of Directive 96/61/EC and which, according to Article 10 of that Directive, require stricter conditions than those achievable by the use of BAT.\n(7)\nIn accordance with Article 176 of the Treaty, Member States may maintain or introduce more stringent protective measures relating to arsenic, cadmium, mercury, nickel and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons provided that they are compatible with the Treaty and that they are notified to the Commission.\n(8)\nWhere concentrations exceed certain assessment thresholds, monitoring of arsenic, cadmium, nickel and benzo(a)pyrene should be mandatory. Supplementary means of assessment may reduce the required number of sampling points for fixed measurements. Further monitoring of background ambient air concentrations and deposition is foreseen.\n(9)\nMercury is a very hazardous substance for human health and the environment. It is present throughout the environment and, in the form of methylmercury, has the capacity to accumulate in organisms, and in particular to concentrate in organisms higher up the food chain. Mercury released into the atmosphere is capable of being transported over long distances.\n(10)\nThe Commission intends to come forward in 2005 with a coherent strategy containing measures to protect human health and the environment from the release of mercury, based on a life-cycle approach, and taking into account production, use, waste treatment and emissions. In this context, the Commission should consider all appropriate measures with a view to reducing the quantity of mercury in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, and thereby the ingestion of mercury via food, and avoiding mercury in certain products.\n(11)\nThe effects of arsenic, cadmium, mercury, nickel and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons on human health, including via the food chain, and the environment as a whole, occur through concentrations in ambient air and via deposition; the accumulation of these substances in soils and the protection of ground water should be taken into account. In order to facilitate review of this Directive in 2010, the Commission and the Member States should consider promoting research into the effects of arsenic, cadmium, mercury, nickel and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons on human health and the environment, particularly via deposition.\n(12)\nStandardised accurate measurement techniques and common criteria for the location of measuring stations are important elements in assessing ambient air quality so that the information obtained is comparable throughout the Community. Providing reference measurement methods is acknowledged to be an important issue. The Commission has already mandated work on the preparation of CEN standards for the measurement of those constituents in ambient air where target values are defined (arsenic, cadmium, nickel and benzo(a)pyrene) as well as for the deposition of heavy metals with a view to their early development and adoption. In the absence of CEN standard methods, the use of international or national standard reference measurement methods should be permitted.\n(13)\nInformation on the concentrations and the deposition of the regulated pollutants should be forwarded to the Commission as a basis for regular reports.\n(14)\nUp-to-date information on ambient air concentrations and deposition of regulated pollutants should be readily available to the public.\n(15)\nThe Member States should lay down rules on penalties applicable to infringements of the provisions of this Directive and ensure that they are implemented. Those penalties should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.\n(16)\nThe measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (6).\n(17)\nThe amendments necessary for adaptation of this Directive to scientific and technical progress should relate solely to criteria and techniques for the assessment of concentrations and deposition of regulated pollutants or detailed arrangements for forwarding information to the Commission. They should not have the effect of modifying the target values either directly or indirectly,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\nArticle 1\nObjectives\nThe objectives of this Directive shall be to:\n(a)\nestablish a target value for the concentration of arsenic, cadmium, nickel and benzo(a)pyrene in ambient air so as to avoid, prevent or reduce harmful effects of arsenic, cadmium, nickel and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons on human health and the environment as a whole;\n(b)\nensure, with respect to arsenic, cadmium, nickel and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, that ambient air quality is maintained where it is good and that it is improved in other cases;\n(c)\ndetermine common methods and criteria for the assessment of concentrations of arsenic, cadmium, mercury, nickel and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in ambient air as well as of the deposition of arsenic, cadmium, mercury, nickel and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons;\n(d)\nensure that adequate information on concentrations of arsenic, cadmium, mercury, nickel and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in ambient air as well as on the deposition of arsenic, cadmium, mercury, nickel and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons is obtained and ensure that it is made available to the public.\nArticle 2\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Directive the definitions in Article 2 of Directive 96/62/EC, with the exception of the definition of ‘target value’, shall apply.\nThe objectives of this Directive shall be to:\n(a)\n‘target value’ means a concentration in the ambient air fixed with the aim of avoiding, preventing or reducing harmful effects on human health and the environment as a whole, to be attained where possible over a given period;\n(b)\n‘total or bulk deposition’ means the total mass of pollutants which is transferred from the atmosphere to surfaces (e.g. soil, vegetation, water, buildings, etc.) in a given area within a given time;\n(c)\n‘upper assessment threshold’ means a level specified in Annex II below which a combination of measurements and modelling techniques may be used to assess ambient air quality, in accordance with Article 6(3) of Directive 96/62/EC;\n(d)\n‘lower assessment threshold’ means a level specified in Annex II below which the sole use of modelling or objective estimation techniques shall be possible to assess ambient air quality, in accordance with Article 6(4) of Directive 96/62/EC;\n(e)\n‘fixed measurements’ means measurements taken at fixed sites either continuously or by random sampling, in accordance with Article 6(5) of Directive 96/62/EC;\n(f)\n‘arsenic’, ‘cadmium’, ‘nickel’ and ‘benzo(a)pyrene’ mean the total content of these elements and compounds in the PM10 fraction;\n(g)\n‘PM10’ means particulate matter, which passes through a size-selective inlet as defined in EN 12341 with a 50 % efficiency cut-off at 10 μm aerodynamic diameter;\n(h)\n‘polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons’ means those organic compounds, composed of at least two fused aromatic rings made entirely from carbon and hydrogen;\n(i)\n‘total gaseous mercury’ means elemental mercury vapour (Hg0) and reactive gaseous mercury, i.e. water-soluble mercury species with sufficiently high vapour pressure to exist in the gas phase.\nArticle 3\nTarget values\n1. Member States shall take all necessary measures not entailing disproportionate costs to ensure that, as from 31 December 2012, concentrations of arsenic, cadmium, nickel and benzo(a)pyrene, used as a marker for the carcinogenic risk of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, in ambient air, as assessed in accordance with Article 4, do not exceed the target values laid down in Annex I.\n2. Member States shall draw up a list of zones and agglomerations in which the levels of arsenic, cadmium, nickel, and benzo(a)pyrene are below the respective target values. Member States shall maintain the levels of these pollutants in these zones and agglomerations below the respective target values and shall endeavour to preserve the best ambient air quality, compatible with sustainable development.\n3. Member States shall draw up a list of the zones and agglomerations where the target values laid down in Annex I are exceeded.\nFor such zones and agglomerations, Member States shall specify the areas of exceedance and the sources contributing thereto. In the areas concerned, Member States shall demonstrate the application of all necessary measures not entailing disproportionate costs, directed in particular at the predominant emission sources, in order to attain the target values. In the case of industrial installations covered by Directive 96/61/EC this means the application of BAT as defined by Article 2(11) of that Directive.\nArticle 4\nAssessment of ambient air concentrations and deposition rates\n1. Ambient air quality with respect to arsenic, cadmium, nickel and benzo(a)pyrene shall be assessed throughout the territory of the Member States.\n2. In accordance with the criteria referred to in paragraph 7, measurement is mandatory in the following zones:\n(a)\nzones and agglomerations in which levels are between the upper and the lower assessment threshold, and\n(b)\nother zones and agglomerations where levels exceed the upper assessment threshold.\nThe measurements provided for may be supplemented by modelling techniques to provide an adequate level of information on ambient air quality.\n3. A combination of measurements, including indicative measurements as referred to in Annex IV, Section I, and modelling techniques may be used to assess ambient air quality in zones and agglomerations where the levels over a representative period are between the upper and lower assessment thresholds, to be determined pursuant to Annex II, Section II.\n4. In zones and agglomerations where the levels are below the lower assessment threshold, to be determined pursuant to Annex II, Section II, the sole use of modelling or objective estimation techniques for assessing levels shall be possible.\n5. Where pollutants have to be measured, the measurements shall be taken at fixed sites either continuously or by random sampling. The number of measurements shall be sufficient to enable the levels to be determined.\n6. The upper and lower assessment thresholds for arsenic, cadmium, nickel and benzo(a)pyrene in ambient air shall be those laid down in Section I of Annex II. The classification of each zone or agglomeration for the purposes of this Article shall be reviewed at least every five years in accordance with the procedure laid down in Section II of Annex II. Classification shall be reviewed earlier in the event of significant change in activities relevant to concentrations of arsenic, cadmium, nickel and benzo(a)pyrene, in ambient air.\n7. The criteria for determining the location of sampling points for the measurement of arsenic, cadmium, nickel and benzo(a)pyrene in ambient air in order to assess compliance with the target values shall be those listed in Sections I and II of Annex III. The minimum number of sampling points for fixed measurements of concentrations of each pollutant shall be as laid down in Section IV of Annex III, and they shall be installed in each zone or agglomeration within which measurement is required if fixed measurement is the sole source of data on concentrations within it.\n8. To assess the contribution of benzo(a)pyrene in ambient air, each Member State shall monitor other relevant polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons at a limited number of measurement sites. These compounds shall include at least: benzo(a)anthracene, benzo(b)fluoranthene, benzo(j)fluoranthene, benzo(k)fluoranthene, indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene, and dibenz(a,h)anthracene. Monitoring sites for these polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons shall be co-located with sampling sites for benzo(a)pyrene and shall be selected in such a way that geographical variation and long-term trends can be identified. Sections I, II and III of Annex III shall apply.\n9. Irrespective of concentration levels, one background sampling point shall be installed every 100 000 km2 for the indicative measurement, in ambient air, of arsenic, cadmium, nickel, total gaseous mercury, benzo(a)pyrene and the other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons referred to in paragraph 8 and of the total deposition of arsenic, cadmium, mercury, nickel, benzo(a)pyrene and the other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons referred to in paragraph 8. Each Member State shall set up at least one measuring station; however, Member States may, by agreement, and in accordance with guidelines to be drawn up under the procedure laid down in Article 6, set up one or several common measuring stations, covering neighbouring zones in adjoining Member States, to achieve the necessary spatial resolution. Measurement of particulate and gaseous divalent mercury is also recommended. Where appropriate, monitoring shall be coordinated with the European Monitoring and Evaluation of Pollutants (EMEP) monitoring strategy and measurement programme. The sampling sites for these pollutants shall be selected in such a way that geographical variation and long-term trends can be identified. Sections I, II and III of Annex III shall apply.\n10. The use of bio indicators may be considered where regional patterns of the impact on ecosystems are to be assessed.\n11. For zones and agglomerations within which information from fixed measurement stations is supplemented by information from other sources, such as emission inventories, indicative measurement methods and air quality modelling, the number of fixed measuring stations to be installed and the spatial resolution of other techniques shall be sufficient for the concentrations of air pollutants to be established in accordance with Section I of Annex III and Section I of Annex IV.\n12. Data quality objectives are laid down in Section I of Annex IV. Where air quality models are used for assessment, Section II of Annex IV shall apply.\n13. The reference methods for the sampling and analysis of arsenic, cadmium, mercury, nickel and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in ambient air shall be as laid down in Sections I, II and III of Annex V. Section IV of Annex V sets out reference techniques for measuring the total deposition of arsenic, cadmium, mercury, nickel and the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and Section V of Annex V refers to reference air quality modelling techniques when such techniques are available.\n14. The date by which Member States shall inform the Commission of the methods used for the preliminary assessment of air quality under Article 11(1)(d) of Directive 96/62/EC shall be the date referred to in Article 10 of this Directive.\n15. Any amendments necessary to adapt the provisions of this Article and of Section II of Annex II and of Annexes III to V to scientific and technical progress shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 6 but may not result in any direct or indirect changes to target values.\nArticle 5\nTransmission of information and reporting\n1. With regard to the zones and agglomerations where any of the target values laid down in Annex I is exceeded, Member States shall forward the following information to the Commission:\n(a)\nthe lists of the zones and agglomerations concerned,\n(b)\nthe areas of exceedance,\n(c)\nthe concentration values assessed,\n(d)\nthe reasons for exceedance, and in particular any sources contributing to it,\n(e)\nthe population exposed to such exceedance.\nMember States shall also report all data assessed in accordance with Article 4, unless already reported under Council Decision 97/101/EC of 27 January 1997 establishing a reciprocal exchange of information and data from networks and individual stations measuring ambient air pollution within the Member States (7).\nThe information shall be transmitted for each calendar year, by no later than 30 September of the following year, and for the first time for the calendar year following 15 February 2007.\n2. In addition to the requirements laid down in paragraph 1, Member States shall also report any measures taken pursuant to Article 3.\n3. The Commission shall ensure that all information submitted pursuant to paragraph 1 is promptly made available to the public by appropriate means, such as Internet, press and other easily accessible media.\n4. The Commission shall adopt, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 6, any detailed arrangements for forwarding the information to be provided under paragraph 1 of this Article.\nArticle 6\nCommittee\n1. The Commission shall be assisted by the committee established by Article 12(2) of Directive 96/62/EC.\n2. Where reference is made to this Article, Articles 5 and 7 of Decision 1999/468/EC shall apply, having regard to the provisions of Article 8 thereof.\nThe period laid down in Article 5(6) of Decision 1999/468/EC shall be set at three months.\n3. The Committee shall adopt its Rules of Procedure.\nArticle 7\nPublic information\n1. Member States shall ensure that clear and comprehensible information is accessible and is routinely made available to the public as well as to appropriate organisations, such as environmental organisations, consumer organisations, organisations representing the interests of sensitive populations and other relevant healthcare bodies, on ambient air concentrations of arsenic, cadmium, mercury, nickel and benzo(a)pyrene and the other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons referred to in Article 4(8) as well as on deposition rates of arsenic, cadmium, mercury, nickel and benzo(a)pyrene and the other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons referred to in Article 4(8).\n2. The information shall also indicate any annual exceedance of the target values for arsenic, cadmium, nickel and benzo(a)pyrene laid down in Annex I. The information shall give the reasons for the exceedance and the area to which it applies. It shall also provide a short assessment in relation to the target value and appropriate information regarding effects on health and impact on the environment.\nInformation on any measures taken pursuant to Article 3 shall be made available to the organisations referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article.\n3. The information shall be made available by means of, for example, Internet, press and other easily accessible media.\nArticle 8\nReport and review\n1. The Commission shall, by 31 December 2010 at the latest, submit to the European Parliament and the Council a report based on:\n(a)\nthe experience acquired in the application of this Directive,\n(b)\nin particular, the results of the most recent scientific research concerning the effects on human health, paying particular attention to sensitive populations, and on the environment as a whole, of exposure to arsenic, cadmium, mercury, nickel and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and\n(c)\ntechnological developments including the progress achieved in methods of measuring and otherwise assessing concentrations of these pollutants in ambient air as well as their deposition.\n2. The report referred to in paragraph 1 shall take into account:\n(a)\ncurrent air quality, trends and projections up to and beyond 2015;\n(b)\nthe scope for making further reductions in polluting emissions from all relevant sources, and the possible merit in introducing limit values aimed at reducing the risk to human health, for the pollutants listed in Annex I, taking account of technical feasibility and cost-effectiveness and any significant additional health and environmental protection that this would provide;\n(c)\nthe relationships between pollutants and opportunities for combined strategies for improving Community air quality and related objectives;\n(d)\ncurrent and future requirements for informing the public and for the exchange of information between Member States and Commission;\n(e)\nthe experience acquired in the application of this Directive in Member States, and in particular the conditions under which measurement has been carried out as laid down in Annex III;\n(f)\nsecondary economic benefits for the environment and health in reducing the emissions of arsenic, cadmium, mercury, nickel and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons to the extent that these can be assessed;\n(g)\nthe adequacy of the particle size fraction used for sampling in view of general particulate matter measurement requirements;\n(h)\nthe suitability of benzo(a)pyrene as a marker for the total carcinogenic activity of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, having regard to predominantly gaseous forms of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons such as fluoranthene.\nIn the light of the latest scientific and technological developments the Commission shall also examine the effect of arsenic, cadmium and nickel on human health with a view to quantifying their genotoxic carcinogenicity. Taking account of measures adopted pursuant to the mercury strategy the Commission shall also consider whether there would be merit in taking further action in relation to mercury, taking account of technical feasibility and cost-effectiveness and any significant additional health and environmental protection that this would provide.\n3. With a view to achieving levels of ambient air concentrations that would further reduce harmful effects on human health and would lead to a high level of protection of the environment as a whole, taking into account the technical feasibility and cost-effectiveness of further action, the report referred to in paragraph 1 may be accompanied, if appropriate, by proposals for amendments to this Directive, particularly taking into account the results obtained in accordance with paragraph 2. In addition the Commission shall consider regulating the deposition of arsenic, cadmium, mercury, nickel and specific polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.\nArticle 9\nPenalties\nMember States shall determine the penalties applicable to infringements of the national provisions adopted pursuant to this Directive and shall take all the measures necessary to ensure that they are implemented. The penalties provided for must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.\nArticle 10\nImplementation\n1. Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 15 February 2007 at the latest. They shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof.\nWhen Member States adopt these measures, they shall contain a reference to this Directive or be accompanied by such a reference on the occasion of their official publication. Member States shall determine how such reference is to be made.\n2. Member States shall communicate to the Commission the texts of the main provisions of national law, which they adopt in the field covered by this Directive.\nArticle 11\nEntry into force\nThis Directive shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\nArticle 12\nAddressees\nThis Directive is addressed to the Member States.\nDone at Strasbourg, 15 December 2004.",

Article 27 of that Regulation provided that examination reports made under the responsibility of authorities of a Member State or a third country which is member of the International Union on the Protection of New Varieties of Plants (UPOV) could be considered a sufficient basis for decision. Article 27 was however a temporary provision which lapsed on 30 June 1998.\n(3) The intention of applying Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1239/95 on a temporary basis was to build up an independent Community system, with the Office arranging for technical examination of the varieties submitted with the application for plant variety protection. The experience of the Office has however shown the need to consider other examination reports as specified in Article 27.\n(4) The majority of Community plant variety rights granted after 30 June 1998 have been based on decisions considering technical examinations made under the responsibility of authorities other than the Office, providing grants in a very competitive market.\n(5) It is therefore necessary to regularise the practices of the Office since 1 July 1998. At the same time, the possibility to apply Article 27 in the future should be kept open. Regulation (EC) No 1239/95 should therefore be amended with effect from 1 July 1998.\n(6) The Administrative Council of the Community Plant Variety Office has been consulted.\n(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Variety Rights,\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nArticle 1\nRegulation (EC) No 1239/95 is amended as follows:\n1. Article 27 shall be replaced by the following:\n\"Article 27\nOther examination reports\n1. An examination report on the results of any technical examination which has been carried out or is in the process of being carried out for official purposes in a Member State by one of the offices responsible for the species concerned pursuant to Article 55(1) of the Basic Regulation may be considered by the Office to constitute a sufficient basis for decision, provided that:\n- the material submitted for the technical examination has complied, in quantity and quality, with any standards that may have been laid down pursuant to Article 55(4) of the Basic Regulation,\n- the technical examination has been carried out in a manner consistent with the designations by the Administrative Council pursuant to Article 55(1) of the Basic Regulation, and has been conducted in accordance with the test guidelines issued, on general instructions given, pursuant to Article 56(2) of that Regulation and Articles 22 and 23 of this Regulation,\n- the Office has had the opportunity to monitor the conduct of the technical examination concerned, and\n- where the final report is not immediately available, the interim reports on each growing period are submitted to the Office prior to the examination report.\n2. Where the Office does not consider the examination report referred to in paragraph 1 to constitute a sufficient basis for a decision, it may follow the procedure under Article 55 of the Regulation, after consultation of the applicant and the Examination Office concerned.\n3. The Office and each competent national plant variety office in a Member State shall give administrative assistance to the other by making available, upon request, any examination reports on a variety, for the purpose of assessing distinctiveness, uniformity and stability of that variety. A specific amount shall be charged by the Office or the competent national plant variety office for the submission of such a report, such amount being agreed by the offices concerned.\n4. An examination report on the results of a technical examination which has been carried out or is in the process of being carried out for official purposes in a third country which is Member of the International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants may be considered by the Office to constitute a sufficient basis for decision, provided the technical examination complies with the conditions laid down in a written agreement between the Office and the competent authority of such third country. Such conditions shall at least include:\n- those related to the material, as referred to in paragraph 1, first indent,\n- that the technical examination has been conducted in accordance with the test guidelines issued, or general instructions given, pursuant to Article 56(2) of the Basic Regulation,\n- that the Office has had the opportunity to assess the suitability of facilities for carrying out a technical examination for the species concerned in that third country and to monitor the conduct of the technical examination concerned, and\n- those related to the availability of reports, as laid down in paragraph 1, fourth indent.\"\n2. In Article 95 the second paragraph is deleted.\nArticle 2\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\nIt shall apply from 1 July 1998.\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\nDone at Brussels, 6 December 2002.",
