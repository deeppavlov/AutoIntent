        "utterance": "Data source: Diplomat Pharmacy.\nWhat happened with Diplomat Pharmacy this quarter?\nMost of the overall increase in revenue came from the PBM companies Diplomat acquired and rolled into CastiaRx. Revenue for the legacy specialty-pharmacy business grew 8% year over year; drug infusions led the way, up 13%.\nGross margin for the specialty segment dropped from 5.8% in the year-ago quarter to 5.5% in the third quarter, but the company is still making almost as much per prescription: $287 per script in the third quarter versus $289 per script in the year-ago quarter.\nDuring the quarter, Diplomat added two more limited-distribution drugs to its exclusive or semi-exclusive offering of more than 120 drugs.\nCastiaRx is profitable, generating $26 million in gross profit in the quarter. But selling, general and administrative expenses, and interest expenses from debt taken on to pay for the acquisitions, resulted in the company only breaking even for the quarter.\nThe integration of the PBMs has generated $7 million in synergies so far this year, putting the company on track to hit its guidance of $8 million to $10 million in synergies in 2018.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nWhat management had to say\nChairman and CEO Brian Griffin\nlaid it out frankly\n: \"With respect to the CastiaRx launch in April, this is really early days relative to our pure PBM performance. It is a rebuilding year for us.\"\nDiplomat is going to lose some Medicare Part D PBM contracts at the start of next year, but those were relatively low-margin contracts set up by the previous owners, as chief financial officer Atul Kavthekar outlined:\nWe expect the loss of this business to negatively impact Diplomat's 2019 revenue by approximately 4%. Our objective is to offset this revenue loss with new relatively higher-margin business, some of which we've already booked. We are still in the midst of the 2019 PBM selling season, and so a full view into the 2019 outlook is not currently available, but will be incorporated in our 2019 guidance.\nLooking forward\nManagement dropped the top end of its 2018 revenue guidance, which previously went up to $5.9 billion; it now expects revenue to fall between $5.5 billion and $5.7 billion. Bottom-line guidance for 2018 was increased to a range of a loss of $0.10 per share to a gain of $0.03 per share, up from the previous range of a loss of $0.15 per share to a gain of $0.01.\nMore important than the 2018 numbers is guidance for 2019, to see whether the rebuilding created a better team. Unfortunately, the smaller companies that Diplomat is wooing for its PBM business don't tend to make decisions until late in the year, so management won't be able to give 2019 guidance until early next year.\nhas no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

        "utterance": "Utah nonprofit drugmaker says it can make 1/3 of Americas insulin and sell it cheap\nLehi-based Civica Rx says its new insulin line could reshape drug pricing nationwide.\n(Rachel Rydalch | The Salt Lake Tribune) Katherine Stewart, from Highland, Utah, holds up an emergency nasal powder called BAQSIMI, that she has to use if her blood sugar goes too low, Tuesday, March 8, 2022.\nBy Erin Alberty\n| March 8, 2022, 10:37 p.m.\nA Utah-based nonprofit drug company plans to introduce generic versions of costly insulin, potentially revolutionizing drug pricing schemes that have long been considered predatory and financially excruciating for diabetics.\nOur goal is to democratize insulin, said Dan Liljenquist, board chair of Civica Rx and chief strategy officer for Intermountain Healthcare. These insulin molecules are well past their patented life, and were intending to produce these insulins so that these formulas, which are owned by society, enter the public domain within reach of regular people.\nCivica Rx will make generic versions of Humalog, Novolog and Lantus at $30 per vial or $55 per five-pack of injectable pens a price reduction of 80% to 90% compared to the brand-name drugs, Lilienquist said.\nPending licensure by the Food and Drug Administration, the insulin will be manufactured at a 3.2-acre factory in Petersburg, Va., where Civica expects to be able to produce 80 million vials and 50 million pens each year about a third of the insulin prescribed in the United States, Liljenquist said.\nThats enough to potentially change how insulin is priced, he said.\nInsulin is so expensive, its something Ive already started to worry about, said Katherine Stewart, 16, of Highland. Stewarts family has spent about $500 a month on insulin since she was diagnosed with diabetes at age 5 and thats for the months after the family has met its insurance deductible. Until then, the cost is closer to $2,000.\nHaving to worry about this seems like growing up too fast, Stewart said in a news conference Tuesday.\nThe familys costs declined after lawmakers\ncapped insulin copays in 2020\n, but those caps only apply to patients with group insurance plans. Meanwhile, many Utahns are rationing insulin, which can be deadly for diabetics, and begging online for leftover doses\nSocial media companies have cracked down on Utahs not-so-secret underground insulin trade, which is technically illegal, so now desperate patients and their families have begun to encode their pleas with spelling errors and alternate wording to evade bots, said Brandi Stewart, Katherines mother.\nMeeting other Utah families coping with insulin costs over the years has shown her that $500 a month is not the worst of it, she said.\nAnother family that had three diabetic children paid $11,000 in one month out of pocket for their three kids insulin because it was the first of the year and their high deductible had not been met yet, Brandi Stewart said. Thats a huge financial burden that a lot of Utahns just cant afford, and it doesnt need to be that way.\nThe lack of transparency in prescription drug prices has made it difficult to know who exactly ends up with all of that money. Insurers point to pharmacy benefit managers middlemen that negotiate with pharmaceutical companies to decide which drugs an insurer will cover.\nWhen a PBM lists a drug for insurance coverage, they get a rebate from the drug company, which the PBMs say they pass along to the insurance company to reduce premiums. But no one knows how much of that rebate gets passed on to the insurer, or whether the insurer actually uses it to reduce premiums and just three PBMs control about 80% of the U.S. market\nIndustry watchdogs have worried that these rebates give PBMs an incentive not to include cheaper drugs on insurance plans, since those capture smaller rebates than expensive drugs do.\nThat pricing mechanism may also explain why generic insulin has been slow to catch on. Months after Eli Lilly introduced a generic version of Humalog in 2019, only 1 in 5 Americans with commercial insurance were on plans that covered it. In a phone survey conducted by U.S. Senate staffers, 83% of the pharmacies they called didnt even have the generic version in stock and 69% said they couldnt even order it.\nAnd two months after Novo Nordisk introduced a generic version of Novolog in 2020, its uptake was even slower, according to GoodRx.com\nBut there are a few reasons Civicas generics may take off, even where for-profit drug companies own generics did not.\nFirst of all, Civica is nonprofit and is not producing generics that will compete with its own, pricier brand-name products, as for-profit companies have. That means it has no incentive to downplay the generic in marketing.\nWhen youre making a more-expensive insulin on the same production line as the less-expensive insulin, whats in your interest to sell? Liljenquist asked.\nSecond, Civica has lined up insurers, including SelectHealth, Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, Kaiser Permanente and Anthem, Inc. as partners.\nWe dont think the pharmacy benefit managers or other people could block this, Liljenquist said.\nThird, even if no insurers were willing to cover Civicas insulin the prices still are a fraction of the out-of-pocket costs for millions of patients who dont live in the 20 or so states that have passed insulin caps, or who are either uninsured or covered by self-funded plans, which arent subject to state copay caps. (A national insulin cap, while popular, has met with challenges in Congress)\nHow are you going to persuade a family to go and shell out thousands of dollars they cant afford for insulin, to stay in-benefit when they can go to an online pharmacy and get Civica insulin at a fair price? Liljenquist said. It will unstick the rebate game for insulin, and thats exactly what we intend to do, so that the patients who are the ones paying the cost of those rebates actually get to pay a fair price upfront.\nCivica expects to complete building its Virginia plant by the end of the year and launch its insulin line in 2024, Liljenquist said.\nWhen theres a market failure like this, that is exploitive, that takes advantage of people who already desperately trying to manage disease, its wrong, he said.",

        "utterance": "160\nVitamin D\nBOSTON HEALTH Vitamin D deficiency strongly exaggerates the craving for and effects of opioids, potentially increasing the risk for dependence and addiction, according to a new study led by researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). These findings, published in Science Advances, suggest that addressing the common problem of vitamin D deficiency with inexpensive supplements could play a part in combating the ongoing scourge of opioid addiction.\nEarlier work by David E. Fisher, MD, PhD, director of the Mass General Cancer Centers Melanoma Program and director of MGHs Cutaneous Biology Research Center (CBRC), laid the foundation for the current study. In 2007, Fisher and his team found something unexpected: Exposure to ultraviolet (UV) rays (specifically the form called UVB), causes the skin to produce the hormone endorphin, which is chemically related to morphine, heroin and other opioidsin fact, all activate the same receptors in the brain. A subsequent study by Fisher found that UV exposure raises endorphin levels in mice, which then display behavior consistent with opioid addiction.\nEndorphin is sometimes called a feel good hormone because it induces a sense of mild euphoria. Studies have suggested that some people develop urges to sunbathe and visit tanning salons that mirror the behaviors of opioid addicts. Fisher and his colleagues speculated that people may seek out UVB because they unknowingly crave the endorphin rush. But that suggests a major contradiction. Why would we evolve to be behaviorally drawn towards the most common carcinogen that exists? asked Fisher. After all, sun exposure is the primary cause of skin cancer, to say nothing of wrinkles and other skin damage.\nFisher believes that the only explanation for why humans and other animals seek out the sun is that exposure to UV radiation is necessary for production of vitamin D, which our bodies cant formulate on their own. Vitamin D promotes uptake of calcium, which is essential for building bone. As tribes of humans migrated north during prehistoric times, an evolutionary alteration might have been needed to compel them to step out of caves and into the sunshine on bitterly cold days. Otherwise, small children would have died of prolonged vitamin D deficiency (the cause of rickets) and weak bones might have shattered when people ran from predators, leaving them vulnerable.\nThis theory led Fisher and colleagues to hypothesize that sun seeking is driven by vitamin D deficiency, with the goal of increasing synthesis of the hormone for survival, and that vitamin D deficiency might also make the body more sensitive to the effects of opioids, potentially contributing to addiction. Our goal in this study was to understand the relationship between vitamin D signaling in the body and UV-seeking and opioid-seeking behaviors, says lead author Lajos V. Kemny, MD, PhD, a postdoctoral research fellow in Dermatology at MGH.\nIn the Science Advances paper, Fisher, Kemny and a multidisciplinary team from several institutions addressed the question from dual perspectives. In one arm of the study, they compared normal laboratory mice with mice that were deficient in vitamin D (either through special breeding or by removing vitamin D from their diets). We found that modulating vitamin D levels changes multiple addictive behaviors to both UV and opioids, says Kemny. Importantly, when the mice were conditioned with modest doses of morphine, those deficient in vitamin D continued seeking out the drug, behavior that was less common among the normal mice. When morphine was withdrawn, the mice with low vitamin D levels were far more likely to develop withdrawal symptoms.\nThe study also found that morphine worked more effectively as a pain reliever in mice with vitamin D deficiencythat is, the opioid had an exaggerated response in these mice, which may be concerning if its true in humans, too, says Fisher. After all, consider a surgery patient who receives morphine for pain control after the operation. If that patient is deficient in vitamin D, the euphoric effects of morphine could be exaggerated, says Fisher, and that person is more likely to become addicted.\nThe lab data suggesting that vitamin D deficiency increases addictive behavior was supported by several accompanying analyses of human health records. One showed that patients with modestly low vitamin D levels were 50 percent more likely than others with normal levels to use opioids, while patients who had severe vitamin D deficiency were 90 percent more likely. Another analysis found that patients diagnosed with opioid use disorder (OUD) were more likely than others to be deficient in vitamin D.\nBack in the lab, one of the studys other critical findings could have significant implications, says Fisher. When we corrected vitamin D levels in the deficient mice, their opioid responses reversed and returned to normal, he says. In humans, vitamin D deficiency is widespread, but is safely and easily treated with low-cost dietary supplements, notes Fisher. While more research is needed, he believes that treating vitamin D deficiency may offer a new way to help reduce the risk for OUD and bolster existing treatments for the disorder. Our results suggests that we may have an opportunity in the public health arena to influence the opioid epidemic, says Fisher.\nTAGS",

Courtesy of COMO Hotels.\nWhen my alarm went off at 7 A.M., following a jet lag-induced sleepless night at Londons Nobu Portman Square hotel, I was not pleased. Unwillingly, I tumbled out of bed, climbed into workout leggings, slid my feet into my slippers and took the elevator down the spa floor. It was a Monday morningmy second day in London after flying in from New Yorkand for some reason I thought it would be a good idea to book a 7:30am Pilates class at the hotels studio; as a Pilates fan, an in-hotel reformer studio sounded like a dream.\nAccessible from the street (for locals) or via elevator (for guests), the wood-clad studio, lined with ten slick black reformers, has a number of morning and evening classes from classic to more energetic power flow. Not only is it a great way to help kick jet lag, but its an opportunity to do some pelvic curls with new instructors, as well as Pilates enthusiasts from the neighborhood.\nThe pilates studio at the Nobu Portman Hotel in London is open to guests and locals alike.\nCourtesy of Nobu Hotels.\nPerhaps fueled by at-home mat workouts or a need for more breath work during a stressful time, Pilates has become increasingly popular. Hotels are catching on, offering everything from basic mat classes under canopies of trees to advanced reformer sessions in polished, kitted-out studios.\nThe decision to put a Pilates studio in was a natural fit, considering it is getting a lot more spotlight as a way to train the body from a 360 perspective, says Marsha Lindsay, the creative director of Nobu Pilates. People are prioritizing correct movement and overall longevity much more [since the pandemic]. And Pilates focuses on training your muscles in a functional way, Not only has she noticed the guests Pilates appreciation post long-haul flight, but how people are increasingly craving breath-focused exercises.\nA pavilion among the treetops at BodyHoliday in St. Lucia is used for both yoga and pilates mat classes.\nCourtesy of BodyHoliday\nA travelers decision to stay at a certain hotel, or even to book a certain destination, can often come down to its fitness offerings: Does the gym have a Peloton bike? Is the pool long enough to do laps? Is there a yoga studio nearby? Pilates is no exception.\nIt comes as no surprise that COMO hotels, a brand known for its wellness programming, would launch group mat and private reformer classes at its Parrot Cay private island property in Turks & Caicos. Lisa Manser, COMO Shambalas group wellness director, has seen an increase in demand for the workout, partly due to the fact that theres a growing variety of methods. Theres a significant rise in Pilates instructors who practice other modalitiesphysiotherapists, massage therapists and Personal trainersthat Pilates can enhance. Better still, the hotel has a 90 minute head-to-toe Pilates alignment session, a curated experience that includes a full body alignment screening and session with an expert, as well as a takeaway body chart with tailored exercises to do at home. (We also recommend a post-pilates dip in the glimmering Caribbean sea.)\nA few islands away, on the balmy island of St. Lucia, BodyHoliday offers group glasses on the hotels Zen Deck, set high up amongst the trees, that all guests can attend as part of the all-inclusive room rate. Pilates allows for guests of all skill-sets to be included, as the exercises can be easily modified, says Andrew Barnard, Managing Director of Sunswept Resorts, which manages the property.\nAt COMO, alignment sessions are offered, complete with a menu of exercises to continue once youre back at home.\nCourtesy of COMO Hotels\nSome places are even teaming up with local experts to help ramp up their programming. Las Ventanas al Paraso, a Rosewood Resort in Los Cabos, began working with Modu Seye, owner of Moduvated, a local health and lifestyle company in 2019. She leads mat and reformer classes as well as different fusion classes including Yogalates, Barre mixed with Pilates and Suspension Pilates. Its an integrative experience that connects mind, body and soul, which travelers today are looking for, says Seye.\nFurther south, Flor Blanca, located along the wild Pacific Coast in Santa Teresa, Costa Rica, also has an oceanfront Pilates studio with every piece of Pilates equipment you can imagine, from springboards to towers, spine correctors and chairs. Its run by a bevy of highly trained instructors offering private and group classes, as well as osteopaths and physiotherapists specializing in therapeutic sessions. This is a Pilates oasis at its best.\nAt CIVANA Wellness Resort & Spa in the Sonoran Desert, the schedule is packed with yoga, meditation and traditional Pilates mat classes. Pilates is seeing a resurgence in popularity, because of its accessibility. Every body type can benefit from and adapt the practice to their particular needs, says Amanda Grant, CIVANAs chief program and partnership officer. With the mat format in particular, it helps that it can be done anywhere.\nBut, like yoga, people arent just incorporating Pilates into their hotel routines, theyre traveling for it too. Shanti-Som in Malaga, Spain, has retreats where travelers can spend between three and ten days doing unlimited spinal twists and teasers. The retreat also includes carefully-planned meals, body scrubs, massages and meditation.\nEven after my rude awakening, my hour-long power class at Nobu Pilates was positively day-changing.

        "utterance": "Send email\nTrilogy Health Services has invested millions into employee education and retention a process that continues as the coronavirus pandemic surges across the country, CEO Leigh Ann Barney told Senior Housing News.\nThe Louisville, Kentucky-based owner and operator is partnering with two colleges to provide continuing education opportunities for its workforce.\nFirst, Trilogy employees and their direct dependents are eligible for scholarships of up to $7,500 to study at the University of Louisville, through an existing partnership between the school and Trilogy Health Services Care Tuition Scholarship program. The scholarship is available to all of the universitys 200 degree programs undergraduate, graduate and professional programs.\nAdvertisement\nIn February, Trilogy and the University of Louisville announced a program offering priority admission to Trilogy employees to attend the colleges nursing program, beginning this fall. The school will work toward accepting up to 25 Trilogy employees per semester, and up to 50 annually. Trilogy Health Services and The Bufford Family Foundation also jointly committed $250,000 towards revitalizing the U of L School of Nursings simulation lab.\nTrilogy is also in the process of formalizing a similar partnership with the Galen College of Nursing Louisville to offer employees priority admission, in the schools Louisville and Cincinnati campuses. These partnerships are intended to give Trilogy employees seeking a career path an opportunity to do so, and in highly competitive nursing programs.\nNursing schools traditionally have limited spots, so they can be difficult to get into. That makes it a little bit more challenging for someone who wants to go from an LPN to an RN, Barney said. If we have designated spots within these nursing programs, then we can put our employees in there and that gives us a leg up.\nAdvertisement\nTrilogy was the 33rd-largest senior living provider in the United States in 2019, according to rankings compiled by industry association Argentum. Overall, the company has a portfolio that includes 110 communities spread across Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio and Michigan. The company is jointly owned by Griffin American Healthcare REIT III and NorthStar Healthcare Income.\nIn this interview, Barney shares details of Trilogys Covid-19 response including how it has segmented its communities to address potential outbreaks; the impact the pandemic is having on its development pipeline; and permanent operational changes stemming from the outbreak including potential involvement in new service lines.\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\nRecommended SHN+ Exclusives\nHow is Trilogy handling markets where there are surges in positive coronavirus cases?\nWe operate in the Midwest, so weve never had the large cases like the Northeast or California or the Southeast. It was a little bit different based on each state and probably had to do with how each state closed and when they closed for business.\nAs communities started to reopen, the biggest thing weve seen recently has been a larger uptick of positives from employees. We attribute that to the vacation season. We had numerous employees taking off and going places. We have a process in place, especially if they go to a hotspot, they have to get tested and have a negative test before they come back to work. We are seeing more positives from those tests. The good thing about this is now that we have testing, we can quarantine those employees and were not seeing the spread as significantly within our facilities. We are catching it from our testing processes that we didnt have access to as readily back in March when things were starting.\nHow are the communities set up to prevent outbreaks, and to isolate residents who test positive?\nWeve split our communities into green units, yellow units and red units. The folks that are in the green units have all been tested and theyre negative for Covid-19. The yellow unit is a transitional unit. This would be where a new admission would come into the facility. Theyll go into the yellow unit for at least two weeks, and theyll be tested. Once we have two negative tests, theyll move off to the green.\nIf someone tests positive, we put them into the red unit and we only have staff that works exclusively on a red unit, so theres no cross contamination between any of the units. They have a separate entryway, PPE is lined up for everybody within that unit. We keep it very contained and very manageable. I think that has helped us.\nThis was something that we developed early on in one of our campuses when we had an outbreak. And we figured that this was the best way to manage it. That also gave us more comfort in our ability to take people from outside the community as admissions, because we know that were not going to mingle them in with everyone else.\nHas Trilogy considered moving staff working in these red units\non-site\n?\nWe havent asked anyone to stay away from their family. Working on the red unit has been voluntary. For the folks that are willing and want to do that, there is extra compensation. Typically the people that do work in that unit, you have the ability to quarantine or maybe it wouldnt be someone who has an underlying health issue.\nWhat other incentives is Trilogy offering its employees?\nOur foundation has historically been known for educational opportunities, as well as employee assistance. We continue to help our employees through that employee assistance program. Weve seen more needs along the lines of child care assistance, as well as helping with food, and we may pay bills. We have seen an increase in the need. Weve also tried to increase our foundation contributions.\nHave there been any changes to Trilogys educational initiatives since the virus spread across the country. Specifically, what is the status of the\nPurdue University Global Initiative\n?\nWe did a pause on new enrollment, but everybody thats in the program is able to continue. We expect that in January well be able to open it back up to new enrollees.\nThe apprenticeship programs that we run, were still promoting, and those all come with pay increases, from the workforce grants that we were able to receive to help fund those programs. Participation in our high school internship programhas also slowed due to the fallout from COVID-19: who could work and who couldnt work; what age they had to be within the facility; as well as parents being concerned about their children. We would love to hire more of these students, but these hurdles have presented a challenge.\nWhat other service lines has Trilogy been able to leverage for operational and cost efficiencies?\nWe already had our own pharmacy and therapy company. That was very helpful. Any time you can control an ancillary service, you get the financial benefits, but also the service that you need in those areas. Going through the pandemic has further reiterated for us with the importance of that, but also having us look at oth",

The average Third member now pays $777.12 per manor per month.\nOccupancy fee\nThird board members agreed to a new rule that will charge a $50 occupancy fee, per manor per month, for each additional occupant beyond two people.\nOfficials said the operating budget is based on two-person households, so additional people need to be accounted for.\nBoth the Golden Rain Foundation and United Mutual already have additional occupancy fees in place, charging $100 and $50 respectively.\nThe additional fee will be used to mitigate expenses related to the additional occupants, such as increased utility rates particularly water and wear-and-tear of common areas, according to a Village Management Services staff report.\nAn estimated 73 condos in Third Mutual house more than two non-lessee occupants. As proposed, the occupancy fee is projected to generate about $43,800 per year.\nOf the 67 live-in care providers in Third Mutual, 26 are third or fourth persons of residence. If applied to those 26, the fee would generate an additional income of $15,600.\nThe total of these two sums estimate an additional annual income of $59,400 for Third.\nDirector Annie McCary said there has been overwhelming feedback from residents, in-person and via email, in favor of the resolution.\nThe board unanimously approved the resolution. It takes immediate effect.\nAlteration fee schedule\nOn second reading, the Third board members tabled a resolution that would have implemented a revised manor alteration fee schedule and raise several fees.\nAlterations are optional modifications to a unit that require Thirds consent, as defined in a staff report.\nAs proposed, the charge a member pays upon variance request was scheduled to increase by $20 jumping from $50 to $70.\nFurthermore, the Basic Variance fee would have been set at $380, the Complex Variance fee at $662, the Unauthorized Alteration fee at $350, and the Resale Inspection fee would have increased from $115 to $220.\nDirector Jim Cook said many of the fees are antiquated. He said the schedule may have once served a purpose to regulate alterations within the Village before Laguna Woods became a city but in the 23 years since incorporation, inspectors are no longer sparse.\nWe are duplicating services that are done by the city, he said. Most of [the alteration fees] should be eliminated.\nHe added that many of the variances listed should be recategorized as mutual consents. Im going to vote no on this until we revise what we require variances for.\nThird member Judith McCourt, who said she once served as a deputy director for a large Orange County organization and still works full-time as president of a corporation, coined Thirds schedule a double-fee system that up charges four to five times city rates.\nFor example, a standard variance fee to install a new central HVAC in Third costs $662. This would be paid in addition to the city cost of $141.\nStaff had projected $83,000 in additional revenue from the proposed alterations fee schedule.\nResident Lisa Mills, a former city council member and former CEO of Orange County Transportation Authority, pointed to the lengthy process of variance approval.\nThis system is very broken, Mills said, listing the various stops, double fees and number of months a resident must wait.\nOn the outside, Mills paid one fee and made one stop at city hall, she said. Residents here who are older, maybe more frail are asked to go through a very tough process.\nBoard members sent the fee schedule back to the committee level for discussion.\nCOVID-19 update\nThe adjusted daily case rate in Orange County has continued to fall, on Tuesday reported at 3.7 new cases per 100,000 residents, according to the OC Health Care Agency.\nThe testing positivity rate the number of swabs and spit tests that return positive the coronavirus stands at 1.9%.\nThe health equity rate the test positivity of disproportionately impacted neighborhoods follows at 2.3%.\nIn the city of Laguna Woods, public health officials reported 1,057 COVID-19 cases as of Tuesday. Laguna Woods has now had 75 coronavirus-related fatalities reported.\nResale report\nThe average resale price for a unit in Third Mutual in February was $507,520, up from $396,818 in February 2021, according to a VMS staff report. Resales year to date numbered 76, up from 71 the year prior. Sales volume in February was $12.7 million compared with $12 million in February 2021.",

        "utterance": "Print\nElizabeth Hertel\nGov. Gretchen Whitmer's administration wants to consolidate multiple contracts for managed care of dental services for Medicaid recipients into one contract, potentially shaking up the delivery of oral health care for the state's poorest residents.\nThe proposed 2023 budget blueprint Whitmer submitted Wednesday to the Legislature calls for a single contract for three different types of benefits: Medicaid-funded dental services through the Healthy Kids Dental program, the dental benefit of the Healthy Michigan Plan for low-income adults and traditional fee-for-service dental care for adults.\nWhitmer's budget proposal for the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services also calls for raising the fee-for-service reimbursement rates for providers by $247.6 million annual to get more dentists to accept the lowest-paying Medicaid patients.\nMDHHS Director Elizabeth Hertel said her department wants a single procurement for managed care of dental services, but that doesn't mean it will be awarded to a single company.\n\"Having a single contract allows for easier management of the beneficiaries and being able to have a network that's adequate across the state,\" Hertel told Crain's.\nThe nearly more than 980,000 low-income adults enrolled in the state's Medicaid program, Healthy Michigan Plan, who get dental benefits through HMP's managed care insurers, such as Health Alliance Plan of Michigan, McLaren Health Plan and Priority Health.\nThose health insurers typically subcontract management of Healthy Michigan's dental benefits to Delta Dental, DentaQuest, DenteMax or another PPO, said Dominick Pallone, executive director of the Michigan Association of Health Plans.\nMAHP supports raising reimbursement rates for dentists, but has \"concerns\" about breaking off a portion of its members' managed care contracts in the Healthy Michigan Plan, Pallone said.\nDominick Pallone\n\"For the Healthy Michigan Plan, we've got that built into our rates,\" Pallone said. \"... If you're going to pull a member's dental benefit out of an integrated benefit and assign it to a different managed care entity, I don't know how you could assume savings.\"\nThe Whitmer administration's proposed increase in fee-for-service provider rates for dentists would cost the state's general fund $69.8 million, while drawing down $177.8 million in matching federal funds, according to the State Budget Office.\nHertel declined to say how much MDHHS spends annually for dental services through all of its Medicaid programs.\n\"We don't generally share what dollar number we're looking at prior to doing a procurement,\" Hertel told Crain's. \"We like to see what people come in at instead of giving them a target.\"\nBy consolidating all Medicaid dental services under one contract, Hertel said, it could eliminate gaps in provider networks.\nCurrently, children in the Healthy Kids Dental program may get service from one dentist who doesn't accept their mother in the traditional Medicaid fee-for-service program or the Healthy Michigan managed care program, Hertel said.\n\"Which is why it's important in this proposal (that) not only are we pulling these together into one managed care contract, but we're also looking to increase the reimbursement rates for dental,\" Hertel said.\n\"The goal here really is to increase access to dental services,\" Hertel said. \"Do I think it will save money? I think in the long run it could save money (by ensuring) adults who currently aren't receiving dental care receive the dental care that they need to avoid more acute or serious issues.\"\nThe contract consolidation move comes four years after the state health department broke up the Healthy Kids Dental contract that Delta Dental of Michigan Inc. had held since its inception in 2000.\nSince 2018, Delta Dental has shared the contract with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, which has used Boston-based DentaQuest as a subcontractor to perform most of the work managing dental benefits for low-income children.\nThat contract survived a court challenge by a third dental benefits managed care firm, Fort Lauderdale-based MCNA Insurance Co. Inc., which alleged Blue Cross acted as a \"shell vendor\" to win a share of the Medicaid business for children's dental care.\nDelta Dental's Healthy Kids Dental contract is valued at $912 million for the fiscal year that ends Sept. 30; Blue Cross' contract is valued at $612.7 million, according to the contracts.\nOkemos-based Delta Dental currently serves 795,000 children in the Healthy Kids Dental program and 191,000 adults through four health plans under the Healthy Michigan Plan, said Rick Lantz, vice president and chief lobbyist for Dental Dental.\nDelta Dental supports the health department's proposed consolidation of all Medicaid dental benefits under one procurement because the current system is bifurcated, leading to different oral health outcomes for the same population of low-income adults, Lantz said.\n\"This has the potential to dramatically improve access to care for Michigan's low-income adults. Delta Dental's position is that it's vital that we make this investment as dental disease left untreated can cause severe pain, infection and diminished overall health.\"\nAdults enrolled in Medicaid health insurance programs often struggle to access dental care, Lantz said.\n\"And because of this, they often show up in hospital emergency departments because their dental pain or infection is so severe that they can't tolerate it anymore,\" Lantz said. \"... We believe it's time to apply the successes of Healthy Kids Dental to that adult program to ensure that our state's most vulnerable adults can receive the dental care that they need.\"\nA representative for Blue Cross did not respond to questions seeking comment about the proposed Medicaid dental contract changes.\nThere are 1.1 million children in the Healthy Kids Dental program, according to MDHHS.\nIf the proposal is approved by the Legislature, MDHHS would put out a request for proposals for a new Medicaid dental managed care contract after the 2023 fiscal year begins on Oct. 1, Hertel said.\nHertel didn't rule out having multiple health plans manage a single contract for Medicaid dental services.\n\"It could be, but we haven't begun establishing anything about the procurement yet and what we're actually looking for and what we're asking people to meet,\" Hertel said. \"But the important thing is it's pulling all of these populations into one contract, one procurement process instead of having separate ones.\"\nEditor's note: This Feb. 10 article was updated on Feb. 14 to include comment from Delta Dental of Michigan.",

Moreover, with the looming threat of inflation on everyone's minds after trillions of dollars of fiscal stimulus were dumped into the economy, it's likewise doubtful that bonds will continue to play their other traditional role as a portfolio stabilizer.\nSo, if bonds can no longer be trusted to serve a valuable role in one's portfolio, how does one replace the lost income and stability that bonds formerly provided?\nToday, I present to you one such option that appears to be an attractive option for conservative investors: Universal Health Realty Income Trust (\nUHT\n).\nThis real estate investment trust owns medical office buildings, clinics, hospitals, and other specialty healthcare facilities and has raised its 4.3%-yielding dividend for 34 years straight.

And, as for stability, the REIT may not be nearly as stable in price as a bond, but it is currently very attractively priced, which limits potential future downside.\nIn short, UHT looks like a great option for conservative income investors as well as those looking for bond replacements in their portfolio.\nThe Portfolio\nAs of the end of October 2020, UHT owned or had investment commitments in 71 healthcare properties across 20 states.\nThough UHT's properties are spread across the United States, the portfolio is largely clustered in five states: Texas, Nevada, Arizona, Georgia, and Pennsylvania.\nSource:\n56 medical office buildings, including 5 in joint partnerships\n7 hospitals (including behavioral health and sub-acute)\n4 freestanding emergency room clinics\n4 preschool and childcare centers\nSource: UHT Overview\nTwo of its properties (a rehabilitation center and a sub-acute hospital) are currently vacant. While these two properties unfortunately generated a combined operating loss of $153,000 in Q3 2020, these two previously generated net operating income of $738,000 per quarter when they were occupied. That offers NOI upside to the current situation.\nSomewhat worrying, however, is that these two properties have been vacant since late May/early June of 2019. The leasing activity (or lack thereof) for these properties is something for shareholders to watch going forward.\nUHT has three primary channels of growth:\nRising rents\nExternal acquisitions\nProperty development\nWhile many REITs have only the first two channels as means of growth, it is beneficial to UHT that it so often partners with commercial real estate developers to finance new property construction and subsequently own the real estate. This continuously freshens the portfolio with brand new properties with long lease terms of 10-20 years.\nFinancial Analysis\nUHS\n), one of the largest corporate healthcare providers and hospital operators in the country. UHS occupies and operates three of UHT's properties. While external management structures usually misalign the interests of management and shareholders, I believe UHT is an exception.\nAs of the end of the third quarter, UHS owned 5.7% of outstanding UHT shares, and CEO of both UHT and UHS (as well as the founder of UHS) Alan B. Miller currently owns over 127,000 shares of UHT (worth around $8.3 million). Miller purchased more shares on the open market as recently as July 2020. Other company insiders were buying shares in July and September of last year as well, according to Nasdaq data.\nFor a REIT with a mere $654.7 million in real estate assets (as of Q3 2020), external management is not that surprising or alarming. Moreover, the 5.3% of total revenue paid to UHS as an advisory fee in the first nine months of 2020 strikes me as exceedingly fair. The advisory fee amounts to 0.7% of UHT's real estate assets.\nRent collection held up just fine UHT during COVID-19, with 99% of tenants by square footage paying full rent for the first three quarters of 2020.\nIn this same period, UHT generated $2.50 per share of funds from operations (\"FFO\"), which was 1.6% higher than the equivalent period of the prior year. Meanwhile, in the first nine months of 2020, UHT paid out $2.065 per share in dividends, representing a modest payout ratio of 82.6%.\nAs of 2020, UHT has raised its dividend every year for 34 consecutive years. Since 2014, these raises have amounted to four cents per year, or around 1.5% annually.\nSource:\n2019 Annual Report\nThat is a very impressive dividend growth track record that management of which is obviously proud and eager to continue.\nUHT's total debt to TTM EBITDA sits at 5.63x as of the end of Q3 2020. Total debt to real estate assets sits at 43.8%, which is quite a judicious use of debt. Only 8.8% of total debt is secured (collateralized by real estate), and the REIT's fixed charge coverage ratio is a healthy 4.5x. UHT's weighted average interest rate, including the credit facility, is 2.17%. Excluding the credit facility, the weighted average interest rate is 4.32%.\nCompare that to average cap rates for medical office buildings of 5-6.5%.\nValuation\nIn 2019 and into the beginning of 2020, UHT's valuation had become extremely stretched along with many other REITs. As such the ~50% stock price decline at the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak should be seen as a result of aggressive overvaluation rather than erosion of the fundamental, underlying value of the assets.\nToday, looking at price to trailing twelve month cash flow, we find that UHT has become much more attractively valued.\nData by\nYCharts\nUHT may not be dirt cheap, but its stock price gives investors a generous margin of safety, as there doesn't seem to be much downside at these levels.\nAs I write this, UHT is trading hands at around 19.2x estimated 2020 FFO. While this certainly prices in UHT's quality, conservatism, and long track record, it's also a lower price-to-FFO than the REIT has often traded at in the past.\nBottom Line\nFor investors in or near retirement looking for safe income with limited downside, there are a lot worse places to look than UHT.\nPersonally, I am a younger investor willing to take on additional risk for the sake of faster long-term dividend growth. As such, I will personally pass on UHT, though it's tempting even for me at its current price. However, if I were closer to retirement and in search of safe income sources that will continue growing (even if modestly) over time, I imagine UHT would be one of my top buys right now.\n*** If you find this content valuable, please follow me by clicking the \"Follow\" button on the left or below!\nWhat Are We Buying?\nWe are sharing all our Top Ideas with the 2,000+ members of High Yield Landlord.

We stand ready to work out the details with the mayor, as we have been throughout this process, the group's chair Harry Nespolli said.\nThe city's largest police union, which has sued the city over the mandate, said its officers dont deserve to be treated like second-class citizens.\nWe have been suing the city for months over its arbitrary and capricious vaccine mandate this is exactly what we are talking about. If the mandate isnt necessary for famous people, then its not necessary for the cops who are protecting our city in the middle of a crime crisis, said said its president, Pat Lynch.\nThe city last month fired more than 1,400 workerswho failed to comply with the vaccine mandate. The uneven application could likely invite more legal challenges over the mandate.\nAdams predecessor, Mayor Bill de Blasio, made vaccination mandatory as a workplace safety rule last year, before leaving office.\nJay Varma, a health advisor to de Blasio, said in a tweet that the mandate had legal standing because it applied to everyone.\n#VaccinesWork unless youre rich and powerful, in which case, #LobbyingWorks, Varma wrote. He added: The #KyrieCarveOut opens City up to entire scheme being voided by courts as arbitrary and capricious.\nAdams had said he felt the vaccine rule was unfair when it came to athletes and performers because a loophole in the measure, imposed under his predecessor, allowed visiting players and performers who dont work in New York to still play or perform even if they are unvaccinated.\nIrving, a vaccine holdout, had been among the most high-profile people impacted. He was able to re-join the team in Januarybut only when they played out of town games. When New York lifted rules several weeks ago requiring a vaccine to dine in a restaurant, work out at a gym or attend a performance, Iving was allowed to watch the Nets' home games but not play or enter the locker room.\nThe Nets need him as they push for a playoff spot with nine games left in their regular season.\nConcerns had been raised this that the rule would also impact Major League Baseball.\nYankees star Aaron Judge refused to directly answer a question about his vaccine statusearlier this month, leading to speculation that another New York team would be hobbled by a player's refusal to get inoculated.\nWhen asked Wednesday about the rule being lifted, Judge said he was happy Kyrie can play some home games.\nThe Yankees, who open their season at home against the Boston Red Sox on April 7, said earlier this month that the team president was working with city hall and all other appropriate officials on this matter. The Yankees declined comment Wednesday.\nNew York Mets owner Steve Cohen gave $1.5 million to a political action committee supporting Adams during his 2021 campaign. Adams is a Mets fan.\nAdams has been rolling back vaccine mandates and other coronavirus restrictions, including on Tuesday when he said masks could become optionalfor children under 5 starting April 4.\nMask mandates for older children have already been removed, as well as rules requiring people to show proof of vaccinationto dine in a restaurant, work out at a gym, attend a show, or go to an indoor sporting event.\nCopyright 2022 The Associated Press.

        "utterance": "Share\nOpen Streets events, in which roadways are opened up for recreation and programming, have been successful in U.S. cities like New York, Los Angeles, and Portland. But Chicagos Open Streets Program, which was staged and funded by the Active Transportation Alliance, fizzled out in 2014due to lack of financial and organizational support from the city government.\nHowever, one of the most successful of the Chicago Open Streets events was a single event on State Street in 2011 which ATA put on in partnership with the Chicago Loop Alliance, a member-based organization promoting businesses and cultural activities in the Loop. The happening drew hundreds, maybe thousands, of people to bike, scoot, skateboard, do aerobics, play play with giant blocks, compete in four square, and lounge on Astroturfed parklets on the car-free thoroughfare.\nSkateboarding at Open Streets on State Street in 2011. Photo: John Greenfield\nNow the Loop Alliance is hoping to create a similarly vibrant scene by hosting up to a dozen Open Streets events on State this year. And their program promises to be a shot in the arm for a downtown that is still struggling with the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAcross the country the coronavirus has transformed bustling city centers into ghost towns, and Chicago is no exception. High-rise office buildings once packed with white collar workers now stand mostly empty and, as businesses and employees increasingly settle into remote work, the question of what downtowns like the Loop will look like post-pandemic looms large.\nLast week, the Loop Alliance discussed its Open Streets strategy at a refreshingly optimistic annual meeting that envisioned a downtown in which office work makes a moderate recovery and cultural life flourishes.\nThe keynote speaker for the online event was Diane Wehrle, a founder of Springboard, the U.K.-based company that provides data from 16 pedestrian counters situated along State Street from Wacker to Ida B. Wells Drive for monthly recovery reportsCLA has been generating since last July. Wehrle presented data from the State Street counters, comparing them to cities across the U.S. and the U.K.\nThe charts reflected what you see any day in the Loop since March 2020: a precipitous drop in activity that has yet to recover. However, Wehrle was upbeat about people returning downtown for business and recreation based on trends in the U.K., which is currently ahead of the U.S. in vaccinations. Every week were seeing increases in pedestrian traffic. People are desperate to get out there. Well undoubtably see a resurgence.\nA resurgence, yes, but a likely partial one, at least in terms of in-person office work. Were anticipating a more hybrid model, Wehrle said. At the same time, that absence of collaboration is very stark. I think were all quite Zoomed-out and we want to see people. As people come back in this hybrid model, it may change [commute] patterns throughout the day. They may come in later or stay out longer to make more of their trips when they come in the city.\nJean de St. Aubin, CLA Board Chair (and executive director of the Gene Siskel Film Center) presented plans for 2021 that centered around cultural activities to entice people downtown for reasons other than work: pop-up art galleries in vacant retail spaces, Broadway in Chicago musical performances on the Riverwalk, and notably, the conversion of State Street into a pedestrianized Open Street on Sundays throughout the summer.\nAfter the meeting I spoke with Kalindi Parikh, Director of Planning at the Loop Alliance. Most of the details for Sundays on State are to be determined, but Parikh said the general plan is open State from Lake Street to Madison (allowing east-west vehicular traffic to cross the route) for up to 12 Sundays from July to September, transforming the iconic thoroughfare into a public plaza hosting pop-up performances, free fitness classes and other wellness activities, as well as expanded outdoor dining and retail space.\nA free fitness class at Open Streets on State Street in 2011. Photo: John Greenfield\nParikh couldnt say if the program would continue after pandemic restrictions are lifted, indicated that if the program is deemed successful, that may be a possibility. CLA has done a lot of thinking about the future of our streets, she said. Weekends are so different than weekdays in the Loop. This strikes me as an opportunity to give them a better version of that. Im curious what we learn from this iteration.\nI asked Parikh if the Loop Alliance had any updates on reopening the Chicago Pedway Systemwhich, with the exception of the bottom level of Block 37, a corridor connecting the CTA Red and Blue lines Washington stations, has remained closed during pandemic restrictions. She said the reopening date will likely be sometime this spring or summer, but its not clear exactly when, largely because some sections of the Pedway are owned by the city and some by private buildings. Its hard to do things because there are so many players. Were trying to coordinate this now.\nParikh did say that the Loop Alliance supports allowing dockless electric rental scooters to be parked in the Loop this year, in contrast to the 2020 pilot While the city and the Active Transportation Alliance have voiced concerns about scooters being carelessly parked and ridden on downtown sidewalks, CLA views the  current reduced car traffic volumes as an chance to introduce another downtown commuting mode.\nThere were fears about traffic, but streets have quieted down, Parikh said. If we [introduce the scooters] early people will learn to share those spaces and learn to use them better, so we can be a more multi-modal downtown. Also considering some people are afraid to ride CTA downtown, it can be a good option to commute or commute the last mile.\nDuring the annual meeting presentation, Loop Alliance CEO Michael Edwards mentioned efforts to connect people experiencing homelessness with services, including a pop-up resource center at the Harold Washington Library and the installation of portable toilets throughout the Loop. I asked Parikh if these amenities, beneficial in non-pandemic times, might also become permanent. Personally, I hope they do, she said. Elevate State, a large visioning process CLA leads for State Street, has been paused. Were hoping to resume later this year, and topics like this are top of mind. It plays into the everyones neighborhood campaign as well. Making sure everyone can navigate the Loop and be able to use a restroom.",

The order came after Animal Wellness Action and other wildlife groups filed a lawsuit to stop the hunt.\nCollins said his group has been following Facebook posts about killing wolves since the Trump administration delisted the wolf from the federal endangered species list in January. He pointed to the Wisconsin Wolf Hunting Facebook page, which include comments like smoke a pack a day.\nOther comments referred to the legal battles as games, and said the wolf population cant go unchecked and unmanaged.\nCollins acknowledged most people posting to the page are blowing smoke.\nEven if 0.1% of those turn out to be real, we think were doing our due diligence by putting the offer out there to get the information to the proper authorities, said Collins.\nState law in Wisconsin requires the state Department of Natural Resources to hold a wolf hunt from November through the end of February when the animal isnt under federal protections.\nAdam Jarchow pushed for the wolfs delisting and advocated for state wolf management as a former Republican state lawmaker. Jarchow, who is running for Wisconsin attorney general, said the comments illustrate peoples frustration with the growing number of wolves in Wisconsin and lack of a season.\nI suspect those people that are saying things are just saying it out of frustration, said Jarchow. Obviously, nobody should be breaking the law or killing wolves illegally. But it does illustrate the importance of having a regulated hunt so that we can control this predator.\nJarchow was among a group of Republican lawmakers from northern Wisconsin that proposed a bill that would block game wardens and police from investigating illegal wolf killings in the state in 2017.\nDNR spokesperson Sarah Hoye said the agency hasnt encountered any trend of illegal killings this fall.\nMeanwhile, we read and monitor all comments on the departments social media. We send any comment that mentions poaching to law enforcement for investigation, wrote Hoye in an email. Additionally, if someone mentions that they know of someone who is poaching, we encourage them to report the information they have via our violation hotline.\nThree wolves have been shot in the act of depredating a domestic animal this year, according to DNR officials. The wolves were shot in Price County in August and September. Since the wolfs delisting, landowners are allowed to shoot wolves in the act of biting, wounding or attacking their animals. Shootings must be reported to the DNR within 24 hours.\nAgency officials have said they havent had any recent reports of illegally killed wolves.\nIn February, state-licensed hunters killed 218 wolves in less than 72 hours, taking nearly double the wolves allowed under a 200-wolf quota.\nThe DNRs report on the February harvest found four wolves were illegally taken during the hunt, which were presented at registration. The agency detected 16 illegal killings of wolves from April 2019 to April 2020.\nResearch has shown that illegal kills account for around 9% of deaths each year. One study by University of Wisconsin-Madison researchers, found that around 100 wolves were killed on top of the 218 wolves that were harvested during the February wolf hunt.\nThe DNR encourages people to report any suspected violations to its violation hotline: 1-800-TIP-WDNR.",

        "utterance": "Telegram\nWashington: A recent study conducted by researchers at the University of Bonn suggests that the activity of individual nerve cells in the brain tells us how confident we are in our decisions.\nThe result is unexpected the researchers were actually on the trail of a completely different evaluation mechanism. The results are published in the journal Current Biology.\nEvery day humans have to make decisions. Researchers at the University Hospital Bonn have now identified nerve cells in the brain whose activity indicates the confidence in decisions.\nA total of twelve men and women took part in their experiment.\nWe showed them photos of two different snacks, for example a chocolate bar and a bag of chips. They were then asked to use a slider to indicate which of these alternatives they would rather eat, said Prof. Dr. Dr. Florian Mormann from the Department of Epileptology.\nThe more they moved the slider from its center position towards the left or right photo, the more confident they were in their decision.\nParticipants had to judge a total of 190 different snack pairs in this way. At the same time, the scientists recorded the activity of 830 nerve cells each in the so-called temporal lobe.\nWe discovered that the frequency of the electrical pulses in some neurons, in other words their firing rate, changed with increasing decision confidence, said Mormanns colleague Alexander Unruh-Pinheiro.\nFor instance, some fired more frequently, the more confident the respective test person was in their decision, added Pinheiro.\nIt is the first time that such a correlation between activity and decision confidence has been identified.\nThe affected neurons are located in a brain region that plays a role in memory processes.\nIt is possible that we not only store what decision we made, but also how confident we were in it. Perhaps such a learning process saves us from future wrong decisions, said Mormann.\nEthical reasons usually prohibit the study of the state of individual neurons in living humans. However, the participants in the study suffered from a severe form of epilepsy.\nIn this form of the disease, the characteristic seizures always start in the same area of the brain. One possible treatment is therefore to remove this epileptic focus surgically.\nTo pinpoint the exact location of the defective site, the doctors at the Clinic for Epileptology implant several electrodes in the patient. These are distributed over the entire potentially affected area.\nAt the same time, they also allow an insight into the functioning of individual nerve cells in the brain.\nResearchers at the University of Bonn were originally looking for a completely different phenomenon: When we make a decision, we assign a subjective value to each of the alternatives.\nThere is evidence that this subjective value is also reflected in the activity of individual neurons. The fact that we instead came across this connection between fire behavior and decision confidence surprised even us, said Mormann.\nTags",

Cramped and uncomfortable, they talked about how great it would be if there was a cozy place in town where they could get coffee and a pastry and sit in comfort for a while. So when a space went up for rent at the intersection of routes 15 and 14 in Hardwick they turned their dream into a reality.\nNow, two years later, Front Seat Bakery is a welcome oasis of fine baked goods and expertly-crafted coffee drinks on the crossroads to points east and north.\nThe bakery feels like a warm and cozy loft with old wooden floors, wooden tables made by local carpenters, colorful prints on the walls and a snug seating area of upholstered chairs. Large windows fill the space with daylight. The glass-fronted bakery display is the main attraction, pulling visitors from the front door like a tractor beam of buttery goodness.\nEverything the bakery makes is fantastic. We really liked the handmade croissants and the kouign-amann. The croissants are flakey, perfectly brown and rich with the taste of Vermont butter. Kouign-amann is originally from Brittany. Its name is a portmanteau of the French words for butter and cake and pronounced koon-a-mann. Like an extra-buttery croissant with a delicate sugar crust, its mouth feel is nearly as good as its taste. Once you crunch through its sweet outer shell, you reach its soft and cool doughy interior.\nAmazingly, Porter taught himself how to bake with the help of a baker he hired to get him started. You do something enough times, he says, laughing, you figure it out.\nHe admits to plenty of failures, but once they hit on what they were good at they kept going and perfected it.\nThe proof, as they say, is in the pudding. Or, in this case, behind the glass on the counter. Pick any item and youre in for a treat.\nAccompany your sweet with an espresso drink or specialty tea. The coffee is brewed from locally-roasted Carrier beans in Northfield and the Front Seat baristas know their way around a frother. We recommend one of the comfy window seats from which you can watch the world pass by for a few sweet moments.\nNeil Dunlop, of Marshfield, has visited bakeries in countries all over the world, a fact of which hes proud and a little embarrassed.\nBOX\n101 South Main Street, Hardwick\n802-472-7947\nfrontseatcoffee.com\nHours: Monday through Friday 7 a.m. to 3 p.m.; Saturday and Sunday, 8 a.m. to 2 p.m.\nPrices: Drip coffee is $2.50 with $1 refills; espresso drinks start at $2.50.

Their messaging attempted to straddle the local and the universal. As a global studio, we try to entertain both local and global audiences. Unscripted shows allow us to accomplish both in interesting ways, said Kobayashi and Goto.

At the time country managers said that Terrace House was not typically something they would want to make as an original series\nHowever, the company has adapted to local conditions and has recently enjoyed success with unscripted comedy seriesLast One Standing, which became the most popular show on the platform in Japan after its premiere.\nIn November, Netflix put on a two-day presentation of some fifty new shows from Japan The first day was dedicated to animation, the second to live-action.\noptional screen reader",

It also brings additional concerns:\nEnvironment E-waste contains a long list of chemicals that are harmful to people and the environment.\nResources E-waste contains precious metals like gold and platinum, as well as elements like cobalt and neodymium. There is a finite supply of these resources and its dwindling rapidly.\nHuman rights E-waste is often illegally exported to countries that dont have applicable laws. Once stripped of valuable materials, the remainder is left to pollute the land, air and water of local citizens.\nData security Computing equipment makes up a large portion of the total e-waste produced. The data storage devices inside often contain sensitive information that can have significant detrimental effects when in the wrong hands.\nWhy do special interest groups, industry and governments care about e-waste?\nFor special interest groups, issues pertaining directly to them are always top-of-mind. Their activism serves as the catalyst for governments to take legislative action. Since organizations have a vested interest in the resulting laws, they prepare in advance for complying with the new regulations. The challenge then becomes convincing private citizens to comply with these laws and best practices.\nWhy should individuals care about e-waste?\nAs the world continues to get smaller, a regional issue can quickly develop into a global issue with far-reaching effects. This is especially true with e-waste:\nEnvironmental issues are more acutely felt as larger areas encounter tainted air, water and food.\nRare resources will only become scarcer and costlier to acquire.\nHuman rights violations will continue. Thankfully, the global economy provides new opportunities to enforce international law.\nData security is a major concern as we become more connected. Certified data destruction soon will be a necessity, but are there enough providers to do the job?\nWhat can I do to reduce e-waste?\nThe three keys to addressing e-waste are education, influence and action. Look for opportunities to make\nan impact at a grassroots level:\n1. Education Share your knowledge with others.\n2. Influence Model behavior that is conducive to solving e-waste problems.\n3. Action Take simple actions that make a huge difference.\nBuy only EPEAT registered products.\nBoycott companies that turn a blind eye to human rights violations.\nVote for lawmakers who embrace e-waste management.\nHelp develop e-waste policies in your organization.\nPatronize your local e-recycling company.\nThe question isnt if e-waste reduction and management will happen, its when. As our world becomes more polluted, natural resources dwindle, more people suffer social injustice and lives are ruined by data breaches, change will become a necessity.\nIf youre ready to make a difference in your world, check out SEDDs website and blog for ways you can help solve e-waste issues in your family, organization and community.\nAbout the Author\nChief Technology Officer and\nDirector of E-recycling, Sadoff E-Recycling & Data Destruction Co.\nChad Hayes is the chief technology officer and director of e-recycling at Sadoff E-Recycling & Data Destruction. He joined Sadoff Iron and Metal in 2015, and oversees the strategic planning and implementation of IT.

(credit: REUTERS/ALESSANDRO BIANCHI)\nMekorots technologies improve the quality of water production and its consumption, and provide a myriad of benefits to the Israeli economy, while reducing the cost of living. They could also greatly improve the energy consumption, big data and cybersecurity sectors across the world, among other examples.\nFocusing on fiber optics, the water company developed a way to fish fiber optic lines throughout the country using its already existing pipeline infrastructure that stretches from the far reaches of the North back down to the southern borders. One of the recent projects that were dispatched was to connect the Negevs capital  the city of Beersheba  to Eilat, through a 280-km. pipeline.\nWe got the idea from the army, Mekorot chief technology officer Moti Shiri explained. The fiber optics are used by the army along the road to listen to noise stemming from long distances. Whether it be a car, people or animals, the technology can pick up and pinpoint the sounds from far away.\nWe didnt start this project for communication capabilities, our goal was to change the pipe to a smart pipe, Shiri said. We wanted to know in every centimeter or every inch of pipe what is happening in real time.\nThe fiber optics discovery ended up being just a plus to the equation, a plus that could save the Israeli economy and its citizens billions a year and countless hours of work in the process.\nThis makes it a prominent option to provide high-speed internet to the entirety of the country  especially sections that would otherwise not have access  at a lower cost than it would have originally been if the fiber optics cables were to be disseminated using non-existing infrastructure  infrastructure that would either have had to be commissioned or constructed from scratch.\nOur goal now is to connect the entirety of Israel to fiber optics, Shiri said. Not all of Israel is connected to fiber optics, and to connect them across the entire country costs a lot of money and takes a lot of time.\nShiri said that considering Mekorot has pipes all across the country  even in the remote sections  that by using the pipes, communications companies can connect to these remote areas quickly, instead of waiting three to four years to do it.\nIf the infrastructure would have had to have been built from scratch, it could cost the Israeli economy billions in construction, deployment, digging, permits and creating the overall infrastructure companies would need to house the fiber optic lines within. Additionally, as a separate plus, Mekorot forwards the option to use indoor facilities for the construction of a data center and Hub.\nMekorot itself, is the owner of more than 13,000 km. of existing and protected underground infrastructure throughout Israel, which constitutes as essential valuable real estate for a fiber network deployment  real estate which will all eventually be filled with fiber optic capabilities.\nTo disseminate the lines throughout the country, Mekorot fashioned a way to insert fiber optics cables into the pipelines and dispatch them throughout the country  2 km. at a time  using an innovative system that uses both water and air pressure to carry and transp",

KaaS pairs all the capabilities of Kurmis on-premise platform with a hosted model that is intended to deliver faster and easier access to the tools required to streamline and optimise the day-to-day administration of unified communication platforms, including Avaya, Cisco, Microsoft and Zoom.\nOutlining reasons for the launch, Kurmi said research had shown that the Unified Communications market is expected to reach $344bn by 2028, driven by digital transformation, a hybrid workforce environment and a surge in enterprise cloud adoption and migration. It also pointed out that the dynamic had in no small part been accelerated by the pandemic, and that a move towards hybrid working has also seen enterprises increasingly looking for flexible and agile management tools that can be delivered in the cloud.\nEnterprises are always looking at ways to cut costs and the volume of hours required to support critical UC solutions is a big part of this, said Thibaut Felgeres, CEO at Kurmi Software. This is why we have developed Kurmi as a service, to extend the delivery model options for our UC automation services beyond on-premise into the cloud. KaaS enables users to benefit from all the existing Kurmi Software features, but with the added flexibility of total cloud management, instantaneous updates and a predictable upfront monthly cost.\nDeveloped to meet this rising demand for UC automation, KaaS is attributed with accelerating the implementation of UC management and creates an improved customer experience, automatically delivering the latest and most up-to-date release of the platform, without the IT overhead. It also offers a transparent and predictable monthly cost model with a range of additional benefits for enterprise customers.\nKurmi added that with KaaS, the ability to create templates by site or function and set up repeatable processes could reduce the amount of time needed to onboard new users by up to 80%, and transforms provisioning UC into a fast, one-click activity.\nAdditionally, automated moves, adds, changes and deletes (MACDs) workflows and processes, including flexible Role Based Access Control (RBAC) and advanced features such as rollback and scheduling, means that IT admin teams can assign day-to-day UC management tasks to employees without advanced technical skills, including helpdesk staff, local administrators and HR assistants.\nRead more about unified communications\nGlobal infrastructure provider implements private network to enable unified collaboration\nand contact centre systems firm to augment and scale networks to accommodate rapid growth and spikes in demand.\nIT needs a unified communications strategy for voice and video conferencing, chat and other tools. This step-by-step guide helps you implement, evaluate and manage UC in the enterprise.\nWith the latest in data encryption and cloud-based systems maintenance, KaaS is said to offer benefits with security software, removing the need for manual integration or security expertise by automatically keeping up-to-date and compliant with the latest regulations and threats, with all platform management handled by Kurmi. All KaaS users will receive access to the latest Kurmi support for new features from their platform suppliers without delay.\nProviding an alternative delivery model to Kurmis on-premise service, KaaS will complement the existing Kurmi UC Provisioning suite, giving customers the same experience, but with what the company assures will be the added flexibility and peace of mind that comes with a SaaS model.\nRead more on Unified communications",

Dhanik joined the team before MySpace became a huge thing, and, from 2003 to 2008, he was the VP of strategic marketing. In 2009, he founded engage: BDR, a marketing company. And that helped him get to a net worth of $5 million as of 2022, and afford among many others a Bugatti Veyron.\nThe former MySpace executive shared a shot of my bug on his social media. He worked on the hypercar and on several other projects with RDB LA.\nIn 2005, Bugatti introduced the Veyronline, which lasted until 2011. It was the first production car that offered more than 1,000 horsepower. One can imagine, its price was up to measure. It was both exotic and powerful and came with the title of the fastest production car at the time. But, even today, you could find its name among the worlds fastest (the Veyron Super Sport version).\nThe German-then-French carmaker gave it an 8.0-liter W16 engine, mated to a 7-speed automatic double-clutch transmission. 987 horsepower (1,001 ps) and a maximum torque of 922 lb-ft (1,250 Nm) go to both axles. The Veyron is able to sprint to 62 (100 kph) from a standstill in 3.2 seconds and hits a top speed of 253 mph (407 kph).\nPainted in black and red on the outside, according to an older video from RDB LA the Veyron sports the same color scheme on board.\nAccording to Vik from RDB LA, Dhanik had purchased the Bugatti a few months ago, at the moment of their video, in March 2021. But, in a past interview with CelebMagazine he revealed he would only keep the car for a couple of years and then level up. So, who knows for how long he'll enjoy this dazzling ladybug?",

It covers the marketed and pipeline drug profiles, including clinical and nonclinical stage products. It also covers the therapeutics assessment by product type, stage, route of administration, and molecule type. It further highlights the inactive pipeline products in this space.\nInsulin glargine, marketed under the names Lantus among others, is a long-acting insulin, used in the management of type I and type II diabetes. It is typically the recommended long acting insulin in the United Kingdom. It is used once a day as an injection just under the skin. Insulin glargine is produced by recombinant DNA technology using a non-pathogenic laboratory strain of Escherichia coli (K12) as the production organism. Insulin glargine differs from endogenous human insulin by the replacement of an asparagine residue at position A21 of the A-chain with glycine and addition of two arginines to the C-terminus (positions B31 and 32) of the B-chain. The resulting protein is soluble at pH 4 and forms microprecipitates at physiological pH 7.4 allowing for the slow release of small amounts of insulin glargine, giving the drug a long duration of action and no pronounced peak concentration.\nDelveInsight's, ' Insulin Glargine Biosimilar Insight report provides comprehensive insights about 10+ companies and 10+ marketed and pipeline drugs in Insulin Glargine Biosimilars landscape. It covers the marketed and pipeline drug profiles, including clinical and nonclinical stage products.

It further highlights the inactive pipeline products in this space.\nInsulin Glargine Biosimilars Emerging Drugs\nInsulin RinGlar: Geropharm\nInsulin RinGlar is being developed by Geropharm for the treatment of Type 1 diabetes mellitus. This is the fifth insulin in the company portfolio, which will complete the Geropharm line of human recombinant insulins and analogues. RinGlar will become the first insulin glargine, which will be produced in Russia on a full cycle basis from substance to the finished dosage form.\nFurther product details are provided in the report. Request @ Insulin Glargine Biosimilars Drugs\nReport Highlights\nIn June 2020, Mylan and Biocon Ltd. announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the New Drug Application (NDA) for Semglee (insulin glargine injection), in vial and pre-filled pen presentations, to control high blood sugar in adults with type 2 diabetes and adult and pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes. Semglee has an identical amino acid sequence to Sanofi's Lantus and is approved for the same indications.\nIn July 2019, there was an official signing ceremony for the partnership agreement between GEROPHARM and NatiVita (Belarus) that stipulates a transfer of the Russian insulin production technology to the Belarussian party. This partnership between the companies is a strategy and facilitates strengthening bilateral relationship between the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus. Implementation of the project will make it possible to adjust highly technological production of insulins in Belarus within a short-term period of time and provide the citizens with modern, effective and affordable drugs.\nIn July 2019, GEROPHARM received marketing authorization for long-action insulin analog glargine under RinGlar invented name. The drug in two dosage forms - 3 ml cartridges and pre-filled disposable insulin pens RinAstra II - will take part in the state procurement procedure in the autumn of 2019.\nHow many key players are involved in Insulin Glargine Biosimilars development?\nMylan, Polus BioPharm, Biocon, Wockhardt, Boehringer Ingelheim, Eli Lilly and Company, LG Chem, Harvest Moon Pharmaceuticals, GEROPHARM, Merck, Paras Biopharmaceuticals, GC Pharma, and others are some of the key players that are involved in Insulin Glargine Biosimilars development.\nTable of contents\n2.

There are so many great dental services available online, but not all are reliable. You can get in touch with the official websites of these online dental services and check out what they have to offer.\nHowever, in-person consultation and examination by a licensed dentist are advisable before committing to a dental service provider according to ones needs. Only a good doctor will be able to help you through dental emergencies. Heres what to look for before committing to any online dental service.\nTable of Contents\nThe Reviews Of The Dentist\nReputation Of The Dental Service\nDo you want your teeth to be worked upon by a service provider with a bad reputation? Reputation matters. Thousands of people commit to dental services without checking the reviews online because they hurry. A quick web search will bring up numerous user reviews. Always consider these before committing.\nThe Actual Charges For The Services\nWhat is it that you need the most? The general practice, cosmetic dentistry, and special needs can be priced differently. Various services are available online with different prices per ones needs. It is advisable to check on these fees and make an informed decision before settling for any company.\nTotal Time Taken For Treatment\nDental procedures can last for a few hours and days, depending on the requirements for your teeth work, among other factors. Some dental service providers with less experience may take longer than expected. However, you do not have to spend most of your time on these treatments. With experts like\nFort Washington Dental Associates\nby your side, you can get better treatments in a short time.\nThe Quality Of Care\nBased on the reviews, it is essential to know what kind of dental services one can expect from the dental service provider. Reading about the success stories and testimonials is an excellent way to understand what others say about your chosen rental service provider. Good medical expertise is also supplied with an equal level of care from the medical staff for better results.\nThe Reviews Of The Dentist\nIt is essential to know who will be handling your teeth and what kind of training they have gone through. The best way to choose\nprofessional dentists\nis to read the reviews online and get in touch with them according to your requirements. Genuine reviews can be reliable to know more about the quality of service offered by your dentist. In addition, you can read about the firsthand experiences of users of these services and make a better decision in the best possible interest for you.\nNo one should ever be tricked into thinking that they can just get all their dental work with any random dentist. You need to have the correct information and feel comfortable with your chosen dentist, or else you will end up wasting your money on a service that is of little help to you.\nPrevious Post\nWhy You May Need a Hearing Test, and What to Expect from this?\nLeave a Reply",

A proposed Federal Trade Commission settlement with makers of the Flo app  over allegedly divulging user data including pregnancy status with Facebook and Google despite assurances that it wouldnt share data  sparked a broader debate among FTC commissioners about their authority to police unscrupulous data sharing. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, who is President Joe Bidens pick to lead HHS, last fall fined the makers of a competing fertility app Glow $250,000 for failing to adequately protect data. But consumers wont see a dime from that settlement.\nThese types of apps arent typically broadcasting your health status to other users. But they are routinely handing marketing companies de-identified data for targeted promotions, which experts warn could easily be re-identified or lead to invasive ads.\nAP\nWeak protections:\nAll of the health and fitness wearables were using, all of the apps were using  there are very few protections, if any, for them,\" said Emory Roane, policy counsel for the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse.\nConsumers by and large have few options for recourse if they suspect an app isnt protecting their health data, legal experts tell Future Pulse. The FTC and state attorneys general can open investigations into shady practices, but consumers themselves typically cannot sue for privacy violations, FTC Commissioner Noah Phillips said. His agencys proposed settlement with Flo doesnt include financial penalties, as it can only levy fines if a company violates the settlement terms.\nRoane said the Flo case underscores the weakness of the nations health data protections. Its a mess, he said, referring to the privacy protections for health apps that go straight to consumers.\nA vast data ecosystem:\nWebsites and apps routinely share consumers personal data with advertising giants Google and Facebook or other data brokers, often linking it to a users IP address or, in the case of Flo, an Advertising ID. The massive advertising ecosystem uses those consumer profiles to deliver targeted ads based on a persons perceived interests and life circumstances -- for instance, maternity clothes or a new stroller for a person who an algorithm identifies as pregnant. Often these practices are buried in a companys privacy policy and cloaked in dense legalese.\nBut while consumers have become increasingly aware of how companies are leveraging this data, they may falsely believe theyre protected by stringent health care laws governing medical information held by doctors, hospitals and their business associates. But those laws dont apply to data collected by most consumer apps.\nFederal and state health data privacy laws restrict data sharing when its gathered by hospitals and insurers. But consumer apps, as long as theyre not working with companies in the health sector, can gather the same kind of data and produce an equally, or more sensitive profile about you and your health information, said Marc Groman, a senior privacy adviser to former President Barack Obama and the FTCs first chief privacy officer.\nAnd thats not covered by any of those laws, full stop, he said.\nAP Photo\nA changing landscape:\nThe explosion of Covid-related apps  from vaccination passports to contact tracing  is shaping up to be the most likely target for health-data privacy regulation in Washington. Lawmakers have introduced at least three proposals since the start of the pandemic to give consumers greater control over their personal information and guard against breaches  protections that could factor into negotiations over future Covid relief packages.\nBut for anything to pass, Congress would need to resolve familiar sticking points. That includes whether consumers can sue over violations, an approach favored by privacy advocates and many Democrats, and whether a federal law should override state privacy rules. Republicans and industry groups have pushed for the latter, but that idea has met resistance from Democrats, particularly the Houses powerful California delegation.\nPrivacy legislation is a heavy lift even in California, which has the strongest data-privacy law in the nation.\nTwo privacy bills on contact-tracing data died in the state Senatelast year, and Gov. Gavin Newsom last fall vetoed another that aimed to protect the DNA samplesthat consumers mail to testing companies, saying he worried it would interfere with Covid-19-related data reporting. Another bill that would have expanded a state medical information lawto include health data collected by websites and apps also died last summer. The privacy agenda for the session is still taking shape.\nHOW TO BUILD A VAX CAMPAIGN:\nCommunity organizers are mobilizing armies of Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and TikTok users to reassure followers that Covid vaccines are safe as they become available to a wider swath of the general public.\nIts not an easy task. Coordinating messaging, stamping out misinformation and figuring out whose voices are trusted on those different platforms are just some of their early challenges.\nPernessa Seele, head of The Balm In Gilead, says the nonprofit is crafting a vaccine campaign aimed at answering peoples questions without dismissing fears stemming from medical institutions historical mistreatment of minority communities. (Her organization taps faith-based groups to spread public health information, especially to African American communities.)\nWe definitely have to strike a balance around, Why are you concerned, and your concerns are valid, and Why you need to take the vaccine, Seele said. For instance, her organization will directly address the Tuskegee study, in which the government left syphilis untreated in a group of Black men. The reality is many of us living today dont even know what the Tuskegee study was about, as well as the new research guardrails put in place as a result, she said.\nMark Lennihan, Pool/AP Photo\n...Seele is planning a social media campaign on Covid-19\nthat enlists celebrities as well as local community leaders. The person who just took their vaccine in Chicago who runs the neighborhood art gallery is just as important as Bishop Horace Smith, she said, referencing a Chicago megachurch leader.\nBut the content of those messages will vary depending on the targeted\ndemographic. In her experience, Seele says, older people have questions about where and how to get the vaccines. Younger ones are more skeptical about the science, she adds. Older ones flock to Facebook, younger ones to Twitter and Instagram. We have to make sure that those we",

Complications include back pain, spinal dysfunction, joint degeneration, rounded shoulders, and a pot belly.\nA survey conducted in 2017 by QI Spine Clinic revealed that 20 percent of the Indian population in the 16-34 age group was treated for back and spine conditions.\nBengaluru-based healthtech and wellness startup Dipitr aims to solve this lifestyle problem and others like it. Launched by Amir Valani in 2018, the startup has launched Strack, a posture trainer and corrector wearable. Positioned as India's first smart 360-degree posture care solution, the wearable tracks and monitors your posture, alerting you every time you slouch with a gentle vibration.\nAmir Valani, the CEO and Founder of Dipitr, wants to provide solutions for lifestyle-related ailments.\nWhy these robotic engineers decided to venture into in-patient services with healthtech startup Alpha Care\nIn the beginning\nAmir, CEO and Founder of Dipitr, said, My dad also suffered from severe back pain and I lost him due to complications arising from that.Later, the neurosurgeon explained that my dads work style, especially his habit of sitting the entire day (8 am to 8 pm), took a toll on his health.\nThe doctor added: what else do you expect from your dads spine when he was sitting 12 hours a day, without knowing how to sit properly or sitting continuously, he recalls.\nThat spurred Amir into entrepreneurial action. It made me determined to find a solution to prevent back pain. Strack was born after extensive research.\nHeres how this personal wearable air purifier lets you deal with the pervasive pollution problem\nThe core team\nAmir hired his first set of people via a TiE conference and LinkedIn connections. My story was powerful, and it was easy to bring them on board after they heard it. We have seven full-time and three part-time employees as of now, he says.\nAmir holds a MS in telecom from Southern Methodist University, US, and has done his post-graduation from IIM-Indore. A serial entrepreneur, he has numerous successful exits in his past. His 22+ years of experience in startups, product management, and marketing played a key role in the execution of Strack.\nKrishna Narayanankutti, who leads the engineering division, has nine-plus years of experience with multiple startups. Naganand V, Hardware Lead, has over six years of experience working on IoT/wearable devices while Anurag Parihar, Head of Digital Marketing, has more than seven years of experience in building and growing a legal startup.\nConsumer IoT company Witworks secures seed funding to launch wearable device Blink\nHow does Strack work?\nThe small wearable can be worn on the upper back, and needs to be calibrated to your correct posture using the mobile app or by pressing the button twice. The device sends out a gentle vibration alert each time you slouch.\nThe team claims that 70 percent of users have reduced their hourly slouch count by more than 50 percent within the first 30 days of using Strack.  The wearable can help users live a healthier life, with improved back health, heightened confidence, and increased productivity.\nStrack is completely designed, developed, and manufactured in Bengaluru. Dipitr has signed up with a contract manufacturer to produce the device, which is priced at Rs 6,700 and available on Flipkart, Amazon, and the startups website.\nStrack also offers solutions to corporates and workplaces where long desk hours are a given.\nWe help corporate clients in assessing employees back health by providing various tools such as customised back health survey, awareness sessions related to back health and ergonomics, and wellness drives that focus on posture improvement, Amir says.\nOur comprehensive wellness solution, focusing on employee back health, takes care of posture correction, training, tracking, and management, translating into a boost in productivity,\" he adds.\nThis startup offers a non-invasive wearable that can monitor pregnant women and prevent stillbirths\nThe challenges and growth\nI come from a purely software product management and marketing background. Getting the right people on board, those with in-depth expertise of building consumer hardware and related software, was a great challenge. But the fact that Bengaluru is Indias startup capital, networking, and LinkedIn helped, Amir says.\nThe founder may have started Dipitr for a cause, but it turned into a huge venture along the way.\nWe launched the product in the market about a year back and are seeing huge traction from two segments of people - people sitting more than six hours a day and those with back pain and posture-related problems.\nThe startup claims to be growing between 15-20 percent month on month. However, the founder did not divulge further details. The company website sees traffic of around 8,000 per month.\nSpeaking about disrupting the market, Amir says, We did not want to take traditional posture belts or braces, and rework them with better material or design. Instead, we decided to introduce Indias first smart posture trainer and corrector.\nThe startup has partnered with more than 50 physiotherapists, including prominent names like Dr Dhanajeyan Jayavel and Dr Gopakumar, across Bengaluru, Mumbai, and Delhi to recommend the Strack device to patients.",

With code: MYXHAPPY100, you can score $300 in savings by getting $100 off + free shipping and assembly ($200 value). Might we add, the delivery and assembly service was incredible, professional and fast! And the bikes comes with a 12-month manufacturer's warranty.\nIf you're looking to mostly pedal your heart out, we suggest The MYX II, but if you're looking to create the ultimate home gym, we suggest going for The MYX II Plus\nThe MYX II Plus\nThe MYX II Plus\nincludes everything The MYX II has, but it comes with a 6-piece weight set and kettlebell (available in different color shades), the Stabilizer Mat, an exercise mat, an EVA foam roller, plus a resistance band. The Plus puts you at $1,599 (not including the limited-time discount and membership), which is still over $300 cheaper than Peloton's Bike Family Package.\nMYXfitness\nBesides the lower price tag, what else made me fall in love with the MYX II more than the Peloton? There's a lot of reasons, but I'll highlight just a few.\nThere's something about the overall feel of the MYX II bike that's more personal. The swivel screen makes it easier to do off-bike workouts, which was one issue I had with the Peloton. I would try to do burpees or other workout moves and would trip over the bike in the process. Additionally, The MYX II offers handlebar height and depth adjustments and a larger pedal diameterall things that make a difference for someone like me who is on the shorter side. Plus, the bike comes in white and black to match the interior of your home gym, closet or corner of the house dedicated to fitness.\nBut, the coolest feature in my opinion is there are separate coach and music volume controls, which the Peloton doesn't have. Some days you want to feel like you're in a bootcamp and have your instructor is your ear telling you that you're doing great or to up the resistance; but sometimes you want to get lost in the playlist and focus less on the trainer's commands.\nWhile I miss some of the Peloton instructors, I'm falling in love with MYXfitness' lineup of trainers. They're fun, encouraging and know how to help you break a sweat in an engaging way. Plus, the classes are available to stream on an app, so you can do trainer-led walking, running and pilates sessions on the go.\nI could go on and on about all of the other ways The MYX II Bike hits it out of the park in the fitness arena, but I'll let you do your own research. At the end of the day, the way you sweat is up to you. But with 2022 just a few days away, I'd suggest treating yourself to The MYX Bike II because those abs and toned legs aren't going to happen on their own!\nNow that you have your new fave workout, head over to\nLululemon to get some stylish activewear on sale\n!",

        "utterance": "BiomeSense\n, a microbiome startup developing a novel biosensor and analytics platform for daily gut microbiome tracking, has raised $2 million seed funding round to complete its prototype biosensor and data modeling platform in preparation for first clinical trials, scheduled for 2020. The round was led by BioX Clan, which specializes in early stage funding for new bioscience technologies. Other investors included Seerave Foundation and SOSV, which was following up on its pre-seed investment in BiomeSense via the biotech accelerator program, IndieBio.\nFounded in 2018, the Chicago, IL-based BiomeSense is revolutionizing human microbiome research by developing novel technologies to enable investigators to collect, store, and analyze the daily microbiome profiles of clinical trial participants in a low-cost, scalable way. By enabling daily profiling, the platform allows investigators the unprecedented ability to tie microbiome changes directly to clinical outcomes in real time, dramatically increasing the research discovery potential.\nThe human microbiome is the next frontier of precision medicine with enormous possibilities for improving our health, said Kevin Honaker, BiomeSense co-founder and CEO. Understanding how and why the microbiome changes over time is key to fully unlocking that potential, but today, getting continuous data at a reasonable cost is impossible.\nNow, thanks to the confidence of our funding and research partners, well be able to launch the first-ever solution to that problem in human trials next year.\nWere delighted to be leading BiomeSenses seed round, said Ho Joon Lee, CEO of BioX Clan. Their ground-breaking approach to continuous microbiome analysis has the potential to revolutionize the diagnostic use of microbiome data and bring tangible benefits to human health.\nWith the seed funding, BiomeSense will complete its prototype biosensor and data modeling platform in preparation for first clinical trials, scheduled for 2020. Those trials were oversubscribed within weeks of their availability, reflecting the widespread support BiomeSense has received from the research community since its launch from the Polsky Center at the University of Chicago.\nIndicating the breadth of the impact a better understanding of the gut microbiome can have on human health, those trials will investigate cancer progression, immunotherapy response, surgical recovery and athletic performance.\nWe have barely scratched the surface of understanding the power of the microbiome, said Dr. Jack Gilbert, BiomeSense co-founder and principal investigator. Recent work by the Human Microbiome Project and others has shown that to fully understand microbiomedisease interactions, we need large-scale studies that track microbiome changes over time, but until now we havent had the tools to make those possible.\nBiomeSense is developing an at-home biosensor to produce continuous gut microbiome data and a cloud-based analytics platform to turn that data into actionable clinical insights. The company provides this solution to scientists studying the microbiome, delivering dramatically more data over the course of a trial than currently available and enabling an unprecedented understanding of how short-term changes in the microbiome influence clinical outcomes.\n0",

Fewer overdoses occurred in rural areas, but the numbers still increased in 2020.\nKathryn Deuvel, Carris Health Addiction Serivces, Willmar\nIt was a wake-up call, said Deuvel, part of a team that started the Addiction Servicesprogram at the\nCarris Health-Willmar Main Clinic\nin April 2020.\nThe timing wasnt ideal, just after the pandemic started, said Holly Morales, a family practice physician assistant on the team.\nPeople didn't know what we had to offer, she said, but as people were referred to the program or heard about it on social media, the staff became increasingly busy.\nHolly Morales, Carris Health Addiction Services, Willmar\nThe program sees patients dealing with all kinds of substance use disorders, whether with opioids, alcohol, nicotine, methamphetamine or other other drugs.\nWillmar had not had a program offering medication-assisted treatment until Deuvel, Morales and Dr. Scott Abrams began it. Abrams works with Project Turnabout treatment programs in Granite Fallsand also works with inmates in the Stearns County Jailin St. Cloud Morales also works with Project Turnabout\nMedication-assisted treatment offering drugs that help curb cravings and reduce withdrawal symptoms can help prevent relapse and maintain abstinence, according to the\nU.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.\nA SAMHSA report lists the ability to offer medication-assisted treatment in primary care settings and not only specialized treatment programs as a key advantage.\nBefore the program in Willmar, people were driving two to three hours to see a doctor who prescribed their medication. The drugs are prescribed as part of a broad program that includes counseling and treatment.\nAddicts still need to work hard to find sobriety, said Abrams, who is a recovering addict himself.\nIm not going to give you the magical pill thats going to make you sober; I wanted that back in the day, Abrams said.\nDr. Scott Abrams, Carris Health Addiction Services, Willmar\nI would say to anyone, dont come into this thinking youre just going to take a pill and be fine, Abrams said. If you rely on a pill to change your behavior, you will fail every time.\nAbrams is in recovery from an addiction to opioid pain medication. Seven years ago, he lost his job as an emergency physician and his licenses to practice medicine and prescribe drugs.\nAfter he completed a treatment program, the clinic hired him to work in urgent care under close supervision. His licenses have since been restored, and his experiences led him to practice addiction medicine.\nBefore drugs like Suboxone or several others were available locally, some addicts tried to buy them on the streets, Deuvel said.\nThe trouble is theres no quality control from a drug dealer, she said.\nLike many other illegal drugs, they may have had fentanyl in them.\nFentanyl is a very strong drug and a big risk of overdose for people buying illegal drugs. Theres fentanyl in everything, Deuvel said.\nPatients will still have to work hard to overcome their addiction, Abrams said, and the program offers options for them.\nPatients can be referred to several outpatient treatment programs in the area.\nFor those who need to keep their jobs and are trying to keep their families intact, outpatient treatment is an option, he said.\nIt still requires a major commitment three nights a week, but they can stay in their community.\nInpatient treatment is another option.\nSome are worried about losing their jobs if they go to inpatient treatment. Abrams uses himself as an example and tells them that if they keep using, the job has a way of going away on its own.\nMorales said some patients come and go from the program. Some treatment programs in the past were strict with people whove started using again. In Willmar, the idea is to encourage them to try again.\nWhat we hope is they eventually find their way back to us, Morales said. Theyre so used to being chastised for missing appointments. ... Thats not what were about.\nMorales said she developed an interest in treating addiction after conversations with patients in her family practice about their substance use.\nPatients are thankful they can be treated in their local community and that they dont have to feel ashamed if they make a mistake and start using again, Deuvel said.\nIts a group of people who deserve way better treatment than communities and medical systems have given, she said. We dont shame people who have to take high blood pressure meds or have diabetes, why do we have to shame people with opioid addiction.\nThe idea that addicts are seeking quick pleasure is a misconception That part goes away pretty quickly, and then its the avoidance of the negative, Deuvel said.\nIts not a choice, either.\nIf you had your life controlled by a chemical that was hard to get, expensive and caused emotional trauma and shame for you and your family, would you choose to use that? she asked.\nAbrams said most people can come to some understanding of addiction through their own experiences.\nEverybodys got their thing they wish they didn't do that they keep doing, he said.\nIt might be something innocuous, like eating doughnuts or ice cream. The reward pathways in the brain are similar, regardless of the substance.\nIm not going to jail when I eat unhealthy food; its not the same thing, but thats how people can understand, he said.\nDeuvel was asked to develop the program by Dr. Cindy Firkins Smith, the former head of the clinic and now vice president of rural health for Carris Health's parent organization CentraCare\nSmith asked her to develop a thorough approach for dealing with the problem of opioid addiction and overdoses, Deuvel said.\nDeuvel spent many years at the clinic as an obstetrician/gynecologist. She delivered lots of babies How could you have a better job than that? but physical problems with her hands made it impossible for her to continue in that field.\nShe earned a masters degree in health care delivery and Smith asked her to come back to Willmar to work on quality innovations. For Deuvel, it felt like coming home.\nDeuvel said she looked at prevention, treatment and recovery, and found gaps in the system.\nWe developed a toolkit to help decrease the number of opioid prescriptions, she said.\nIts a balancing act, she said, of providing adequate treatment for pain while avoiding prescribing opioids wh",

        "utterance": "Email\nFew verticals are as vital or as global as the chemical industry, where the raw materials that cross borders find their way into everything from computer chips to potato chips. Shortages of those chemicals and bottlenecks in supply chains ultimately translate into shortages on shelves of everything from beauty products to paint cans.\nAnd yet, the chemical buying process itself, in which buyers connect with suppliers, place orders and get them fulfilled, is archaic and paper based. As ChemDirectCEO Tyler Ellisontold Karen Webster, Its extraordinarily opaque.\nIts a highly fragmented market, too, said Ellison, marked by $6 trillion in sales volume but where even major players have low single-digit market share.\nIts also marked by intermediaries including distributors, so transparency into end demand (and supply) is, to put it mildly, less than optimal. There are any number of causes of friction in the supply chain, said Ellison, tied to regulatory and political events everything from pandemics to production disruptions to tariffs.\nThe inefficient sales cycles can be improved considerably, he said, with two-sided automated, direct and digital marketplaces that bring buyers and sellers online in an experience that changes not just sourcing and price discovery, but the entire procurement process.\nThe urgency is there, and Ellison said ChemDirects genesis stems from his own time as CEO of a chemicals manufacturing company that led to frustration with lack of visibility into end markets and the multiple steps involved in getting orders in place.\nThe conversation came amid ChemDirects announcement earlier this month that it had launched version 2.0 of its website, with enhanced point, click and buy capabilities, as well as faster delivery speeds.\nIn terms of mechanics, as the platform is embedded into enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems via application programming interfaces (APIs), a chemical buyer can shop on the marketplace for the best pricing from verified chemical suppliers and manufacturers. The manufacturers, he said, are vetted (internally) by the platform (additional verification and security checks come from the payments partners).\nSuppliers are given a digital storefront at no cost, allowing buyers to shop directly and access those suppliers marketing materials and accreditation certificates. Along the way, he said, eliminating the distributors from the equation (and from the marketplace) allows those suppliers to build up their brands as they become known and trusted by the buyers.\nFinding the Tipping Point\nIn constructing the marketplace, which debuted last year and took six months to build, once wed reached that tipping point, the customer acquisition has been very good, said Ellison.\nHe added that the most recent enhancement of the site serves all manner of buyers and suppliers, from larger firms down to technical buyers (who scout for chemicals with different characteristics and even impurities) to occasional buyers who might be considered long tail users.\nThe companys platform also has payments functionality built in. Ellison noted that ChemDirect has partnered with Balance, a B2B payments firm, and Stripe to offer terms across a range of payments optionality, from ACH to cards. The payments functionality built into the platform allows payments to be staged based on certain milestones or approvals and receipts.\nAnd in a departure from what seems to be the fashion du jour no blockchain or cryptocurrencies are in the mix.\nThe Logistics Puzzle\nBeyond payments, Ellison said that one key failing of most B2B eCommerce sites centers on the fulfillment side of the equation. The average time till fulfillment in the chemicals space lasts anywhere from 12 to 20 weeks; the average fulfillment time with ChemDirect is three and a half days.\nOne of the of the things weve learned about institutional buyers is that they like a permission-based system, he said. If youre the procurement director, you might have 15,000 of monthly permissions to buy, and weve digitized that whole process. Knitting together a more digital value chain and skipping all those steps benefits everybody.\nThat shortened fulfillment time has positive ripple effects up and down supply chains as firms cut down on their inventory and re-ordering costs, he said.\nIn the future, the platform will continue to bring buyers and sellers together globally, with focus on the largest production regions in Asia, including India and China, and the largest consumption regions, marked by the U.S. and western Europe, he said.\nFurther advances in payments will be tied to continued efforts to understand the processes and constraints around foreign producers. As Ellison said: Some of them need prepayments, others do not. Still other firms can forward position inventory under a range of terms. We need to map out workflows before we overlay solutions.\nMonetizing the Data\nThe wealth of data accumulated on the platform across buyers and sellers can hint at changes in the market in the surpluses or shortages that loom. Case in point: Ellison recounted how in the early throes of the pandemic, isopropyl alcohol (and all the things that go into it) saw spikes in demand in the thousands of percentage points. In March of last year, ChemDirect was among the only places that had access to isopropyl alcohol. Passing the demand data along to the manufacturer allowed it to adjust its production.\nWe consider ourselves the demand scouts of the industry, he said, with data that may be, eventually, monetized while creating a B2C experience in a B2B marketplace.",

        "utterance": "purchase the former Bank of America complex\noff Route 3 in Belfast.\nThetransaction is major, with the property incorporating a 142-acre campus and seven buildings with 316,000 square feet of office space. The purchase means that Seaport Community Health Care Center in Belfast, which is part of PCHC, will be able to grow. More than that, though, the nonprofit organization is looking to use its new location to increase access to health care and fill wellness gaps in the community, although its at the early stages of figuring out what that will look like.\nIts an incredibly exciting opportunity, for us and the whole community, Lori Dwyer, the president and chief executive officer of Penobscot Community Health Care, the largest federally qualified health center in Maine, said Tuesday. We really see ourselves as part of the community economic development plan.\nThesale is expected to breathe new life into a complex that once served as an economic engine for the region but has grown much quieter since its heyday in the early 2000s.\nWe have lots of thoughts, Dwyer said. Were exploring and researching the kind of aligned services that will be a good fit for that campus. None of this is definitive. I cant emphasize enough how much input well be seeking from the community.\nThe organization, which announced in July that it was under contract to purchase the campus, had a virtual real estate closing on Friday. It bought the property from current owner STAG IV Belfast LLC, part of real estate investment company Stag Capital of Boston. Prior to that, it was owned by Bank of America, which acquired it after buying MBNA in 2005.\nRight now, PCHCs firm plans for the campus revolve around Building 5,a 72,000- square foot structure which will be renovated to be the new home for Seaport Community Health Center. The health center, which has 8,000 patients, now operates in a leased, 11,800- square foot building at 53 Schoodic Drive in Belfast, around the corner from the new property. It offers primary care, mental health services, recovery services, a pharmacy and more, and is bursting at the seams, according to officials, who said it needs to more than double its size to meet current and future needs.\nTheres more than enough space in the new building, where the practice will occupy the first floor, with the second floor reserved for PCHC administrative and other uses. The organization has secured a federal grant to help with the renovations of the building, Dwyer said. Future services offered there will include dental care and expanded mental health and recovery programs.\nThe largest structure, Building 8, will continue to be occupied by Bank of America.\nAs for the development of the rest of the vacant office space and large campus, time will tell, she said. Ideas so far include a child care center and senior services.\nI think the broader vision is focused on community wellness, Dwyer said, adding that the organization plans to work cooperatively with other health care providers such as Waldo County General Hospital. We want to work with them and work with other people to identify whats missing. We want to fill in the gaps.\nWhatever happens, the campus is likely to look quite different than it did 20 years ago. At the height of MBNAs Belfast operations in the late 1990s and early 2000s, the company employed about 3,000 people there as debt collectors, call center workers and more, a number that equaled nearly half of the population of the midcoast city.\nBut things changed when Bank of America moved in. That companys much smaller workforce no longer needed the acres of climate-controlled cubicles, and sold part of the campus to Massachusetts-based athenahealth. The rest of the holdings eventually were sold to STAG IV. With some of the buildings empty or underused, the changing real estate reality led to a years-long dispute between STAG IV and the city of Belfast about the tax valuation for the property. In 2015, the city valued the property at $41 million, but after the city and the investment company came to an agreement in 2018, the assessed value has dropped to about a quarter of that sum.\nSTAG IV has remained one of the citys largest property taxpayers, nonetheless, paying $261,039 to Belfast last year.\nIn 2019, the company tried to sell the property at auction with bids starting at just $1.8 million, but itsreserve wasntmet so it wasnt sold.\nDwyer said that because her organization has a for-profit tenant at the property, the general rule that nonprofit organizations are exempt from paying property taxes does not applyto the property as a whole. She and others at the health care organization are looking forward to moving forward with renovations and plans. Were just excited, she said. Its a nice bright spot in the midst of this very gloomy pandemic.\nMore articles from the BDN\nTagged:",

Anyone can read what you share.\nGive this article\nRead in app\nVanessa Barboni Hallik, founder of Another Tomorrow, a direct-to-consumer brand that opened a store in Greenwich Village.\nCredit...\nDeSean McClinton-Holland for The New York Times\nBy\nMarch 23, 2022,\n3:00 a.m. ET\nWhen Vanessa Barboni Hallik began working on a new line of sustainably sourced womens apparel, she envisioned a direct-to-consumer model that would bypass traditional retailers and the complicated, often revenue-draining world of wholesale.\nShe started her company, Another Tomorrow, as a digital business six weeks before the onset of the pandemic, relying on social media and search engine advertising to reach potential customers. But opening a physical store was always part of her plan.\nMs. Barboni Hallik, a former Morgan Stanley managing director, focused on Greenwich Village, a robust residential Manhattan neighborhood that had a surfeit of storefront vacancieseven before the pandemic.\nI felt a gravitational pull toward a more residential space, she said. And it felt meaningful to make an investment in an area that needed a shot in the arm.\nMs. Barboni Hallik is not alone among e-commerce entrepreneurs who are turning to physical stores. Many retailers ramped up their e-commerce efforts while Americans were stuck at home during lockdowns, but for others, the pandemic presented new real estate opportunities.\nSome larger online brands like Warby Parker and AllBirds have expanded with physical locations for several years, and smaller companies are now experimenting as well, opening free-standing shops, leasing from a retail service or securing short-term spaces in other stores.\nBusiness owners are motivated by multiple factors. Some have always included brick-and-mortar outposts as part of their strategy, adopting whats known as an omnichannel approach, which provides a seamless shopping experience across desktop, mobile and physical platforms.\nFor others, renting a store has become more attractive because the cost of acquiring customers through social media advertising has become prohibitive, said Michael Brown, a partner in the consumer products and retail practice at Kearney, a consulting firm. The tipping point varies, he added, but it typically occurs where growth has slowed and the cost of acquiring new customers has increased.\nEstimates of an often-cited retail metric known as customer acquisition costs range from $100 to more than $800 per customer, said Daniel McCarthy, a professor at Emory Universitys Goizueta School of Business, who has done extensive research in the field. In addition, changes to Apples operating systemfor its mobile devices make it harder to send targeted ads to potential customers; Google recently announced work on privacy settings for its Androidoperating system.\nMs. Barboni Hallik thought that her store in Greenwich Village would attract potential customers who might overlook online advertising. The location was available for roughly 18 months, and she is negotiating a new lease.\nNewer retailers, however, often dont come from a bricks-and-mortar background and dont want to commit to a long-term lease, said Naveen Jaggi, the president of retail advisory services at JLL, the commercial real estate company. As a result, he said, property owners have become more flexible.\nThe big trend line we have seen during the pandemic is that many landlords are starting to recognize that in order to attract different brands that can make their property stand out, they will have to go to shorter lease terms, he said.\nRents in some high-traffic areas, whether in malls or premium urban neighborhoods, have held to prepandemic levels, he added.\nImage\nMs. Barboni Hallik thought that her store would attract potential customers who might overlook online advertising.\nCredit...\nDeSean McClinton-Holland for The New York Times\nIn addition to shorter leases, some landlords are offering more generous tenant improvement allowances. And taking a percentage of store revenue in lieu of a fixed rent, while not a new strategy, has become more common.",

Increase in the number of hospitalizations related to COVID-19 cases has created a strain on the supplies of pharmaceutical and personal hygiene products such as sanitary napkins and adult diapers. This represents a significant opportunity for adult diaper manufacturers.\nKimberly-Clark Corporation.,Essity AB, Abena A/S, and OntexGroupandHealth Care Products, Inc. are among the well-established players present in the global adult diapers market.\nAdult diaper is made to be worn by an individual whose body is bigger than that of a baby or newborn child.

Grown-up diapers are available in various sorts, for example, cushions which are known as incontinence cushions, underwear and the diapers that take after conventional diapers utilized for youngster. Asia Pacific held the largest share of the global adult diapers market. Based on product type, the global adult diapersmarket has been segmented into pant type, pad type, tape type, and others. The pant typesegment dominated the global adult diapers market in 2018.Pant style adult diaper is the most popular diapers, which offers flexibility, and a breathable waistband, which makes it easy to use and enables air to pass, preventing rashes.

        "utterance": "The Maze Runner\n, which at least gave us characters to root for and cool robot bugs.\nOur apocalypse might be similar to the makings of our best science fiction writers, but it certainly wont have the glamor. To be completely honest, the end of the world doesnt really strike the kind of fear in me I think it probably should. In place of this fear is more of a passive understanding that whats to come is out of my control. Maybe I should be angrier about the worlds looming climate changedisasters or the ongoing threat of a major global conflictthat has the capacity to wipe out life on Earth.\nAs it stands right now, most days I feel powerless to make any significant change that could possibly put to a halt the rapid downward spiral it feels like the world is heading towards. With the emphasis constantly placed on individual actions that are palatable enough to appeal to the masses like reusable bagsand paper straws often we lose sight of the true forces that have the power to send the world as we know it into a true apocalypse corporate greedand capitalism\nIf that sounds at all too nihilistic, its probably because I just finished reading Tom Kaczynskis Beta Testing the Ongoing Apocalypse. Set to release in March of this year, Beta Testing the Ongoing Apocalypse is an expansion of Kaczynskis 2013 collection of comics, Beta Testing the Apocalypse. With comics pulled from The Drama, Punk Planet and Backwards City Review as well as two new stories, Kaczynski creates a work that forces the reader to stare directly into the face of the worst parts of our world. This kind of honest and unabashedly cynical writing style fits perfectly with Kaczynskis subject matter. While hes not afraid of having a bit of fun telling his stories, he is able to masterfully examine the world in which we live and the place of human beings in it.\nOne of my favorite stories in the collection is called Million Year Boom. Originally published in MOME 11 in 2008 and reprinted in the anthology Best American Nonrequired Reading in 2009, our protagonist has recently been hired at a start-up that was looking to make it big in the green economy. The protagonist notes that the conglomeration of hippy scientists, lawyers and managers, drowning in investor capital all lacked any semblance of corporate identity and rather extended their tentacles into a variety of industries. Sounds pretty familiar. As the protagonist spends more time at the start-up, he starts to experience allergy symptoms, which are quickly abated when his coworker suggests a medication that takes away his symptoms. As the story continues, the protagonist becomes more distinctly animal, with his heightened senses spurred by the medication as well as new primal urges.\nKaczynski does a better job writing and illustrating the story than I could ever achieve through explaining it. As Adalbert Arcane explains at the Notes and Theories section of the novel (absolutely required reading if youre picking up this book), Million Year Boom excavates the primitive drives concealed within us under a thin veneer of civilization. Arcane goes on to say that in order to save the planet, its necessary for humans to devolve. Even all the green activists view the planet as something to protect (we are more significant than nature) or insist that we must de-industrialize(i.e. to devolve, implicit in that demand is our already existing evolution beyond nature).\nAs an environmentalist, Im not sure what it looks like to think about preventing a climate change-induced apocalypse from happening that doesnt include a feeling of needing to protect. Maybe that need to protect really does come from a sense of significance over nature after all, I think theres an argument that could be made that we have mastered natureto the point in which we can use it to meet all of our needs.\nI also feel confident that no matter what happens to our Earth whether life is business as usual for the next 1,000 years or the climate crisis kills us all in the next 100 nature will find a way to go on without us. Arcane also gets to this point in his Notes and Theories on Kaczynskis never-before-published Utopia Dividend. Arcane mentions the countless times nature has filled in the areas that humans have abandoned, filling in the voids and creating wild spaces once again.However, Arcane also says, When environmental activists talk about isolating and preserving natural habitats, deindustrializing and denuclearizing, they really speak about humans leaving the planet. This can be achieved through only two means: extinction or exodus.\nIm not sure the solution to saving our planet and preventing an apocalypse is simply to leave. While that certainly would solve the problem on Earth, itd either extend the inevitable to when we all pack up and move to another planet or completely wipe humans out of existence. I may not be afraid of the coming apocalypse, but I still would rather it not happen! And Id prefer for humanity to survive for future generations. Unfortunately, I dont have any of the answers. Is it better to be more pessimistic or optimistic about the state of our climate crisis? Do my individual actions really matter in preventing the human-caused apocalypse from happening? Is hope for a better future all we have? I guess Im just crossing my fingers that I can figure it out before the apocalypse comes.\nDaily Arts Writer Isabella Kassa can be reached at",

Aging Baby Boomers-the Silver Tsunami want to age differently than their grandparents did, says Schonbrun. We are designing for ourselves.\nThe Great Room has immediate access to a lushly landscaped outdoor courtyard. NYC design firm Pembrooke & Ives and local developer Trammel Crow collaborated with Balfour on the 138-unit building featuring penthouses, a swimming pool, theatre and no large buy-in fees.\nNative Content\nA successful career as CEO of National Jewish Hospital and government nursing home regulator didnt come close to preparing Michael Schonbrun for the challenges of relocating his then recently widowed mother Madeline from the familys NYC apartment to senior living. The lessons learned from that journey is the origin story behind the soon-to-be-built Balfour at Palisades.\nQuality is our standard says Schonbrun, CEO of Balfour Senior Living, a collection of boutique senior living communities. My mothers\njoie de vivre\nand life-long appreciation for the finer things in life have inspired us to meet her high standards in creating beautiful communities and a lifestyle that fulfills and delights our residents.\nFounded 23 years ago, Balfour Senior Living is a Colorado-based company that started small by design and is now expanding its luxury boutique footprint to East Coast markets. It currently has 11 locations  ten in Colorado and one in Michigan and its Washington, D.C. and Brookline, MA communities are expected to deliver in 2023. Were not looking to be the biggest, explains Susan Juroe, the companys Co-founder, and General Counsel. Our goal is to be the best and most admired in our category by creating unique environments that enrich the lives of the people who live and work there. We also feel strongly about offering our residents a beautiful and compelling destination where their friends and families can also enjoy Balfours amenities and hospitality.\nThe architecture of Balfour at Palisades was informed by local art deco landmarks  the neighborhoods Glen Echo Amusement Park, MacArthur Theater, and the glamourous residential buildings of that era such as the Kennedy-Warren. Balfour partnered with the local developer Trammell Crow, award-winning architecture firm Perkins Eastman which brought the stylized art deco design to life, and NYC design firm Pembrooke and Ives who brought best-in-class residential design experience and made them ideal collaborators for this project.\nBalfour at Palisades will feature 138 apartment homes with a variety of floor plans, including studios, one- and two-bedrooms, one bedroom with dens and one- and two-bedroom penthouse apartments. Of these, ten units are part of D.C.s Inclusionary Zoning program and are income restricted. Residents will have the convenience of a range of services centered around their lifestyle and needs from independent living to assisted living, and memory care. The amenities include seasonally inspired culinary offerings at breakfast, lunch and dinner, seven days a week in three dining venues, indoor saltwater pool, sauna, fitness center and yoga studio, hair salon, theatre, a library, bar, housekeeping and home maintenance services, valet parking for residents and their guests, reserved covered parking, rooftop access and a Tesla fleet staffed with Balfour drivers to meet scheduled or spontaneous local transportation needs.\nThe Balfour at Palisades community spaces feature exceptional quality architecture, dcor and art where future residents can proudly welcome their families and friends.  The bar evokes the mood of some of DCs iconic clubs and restaurants.\nBalfours model does not have a large buy-in fee, instead charging monthly rent plus a la carte levels of care when or if needed. Its a model that requires Balfour to earn your trust every day and allow for flexibility should a relocation or changed life circumstances arise. Additionally, couples can stay together with care brought into their apartment home if needed.\nFor Michael Schonbrun and his partner Susan Juroe, a Georgetown resident for 20 years, Balfour represents a personal calling. We wanted to create places where residents can welcome their friends and families and enjoy wonderful experiences together. The Palisades is designed for ease of living and engagement within and beyond our community. Residents can enjoy all that the Palisades neighborhood offers  only steps away from their front door  and all that the Washington, D.C.  area has to offer. Another plus: Balfour is pet friendly. Residents can move in with their pets and Its common for some pet-less residents to adopt pets after theyve settled in. Balfour at Palisades will feature an indoor off-leash pet park and a pet grooming station.\nThe silver tsunami is nowhere close to cresting according to AARP and other senior advocacy groups. Baby Boomers (sorry, Millennials!) are still making their influence known in all sorts of ways. To be honest, we designed Balfour for ourselves. And for Madeline, of course! Michael admits. We thought seriously of what we would like and need to feel comfortable, what it meant to feel at home and have that pride of place  thats something were always working on. Susan adds, Were also mindful of the challenges people are facing as they age. Loneliness, depression, and lack of physical, mental, and emotional stimulation are real health hazards. At Balfour, were creating communities where everyone can feel valued and welcome and are free to discover new interests and friendships.\nLocal architects Perkins Eastman took inspiration from the art deco buildings in the Palisades as well as the grand historic residential buildings in Washington, DC to create a design compatible with the neighborhood. Balfour at Palisades is set to open in 2023.\nBalfour at Palisades will be located at 4865 MacArthur Blvd NW, D.C. 20007 and is expected to open in 2023. The leasing center address is 4418 MacArthur Blvd., NW. For more details or to schedule a meeting at their leasing center contact Eileen Alexander, Executive Director,",

UC Berkeley is home to Jennifer Doudna, who won a 2020 Nobel Prizewith Emmanuelle Charpentier for discovering the CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing technique.\nIt also complicatesthe work of some biotech companies to develop gene-editing therapies based on CRISPR: many, including companies like Caribou Biosciences (co-founded by Doudna) and Intellia Therapeutics, which licensed the CRISPR tech from the UC Berkeley group.\nThis decision once again confirmed Broads patents were properly issued, Broad Institute said in a statement. Broad believes that all institutions should work together to ensure wide, open access to this transformative technology.\nThe UC Berkeley group, collectively referred to as CVC, said in a statementthat it intends to challenge the decision. The group holds dozens of other CRISPR-related patents.\nThe decision is likely an end to a long-running fightover ownership of the gene-editing technique, which revolutionized genetic research and biotech. It lets scientists easily and precisely cut and and reorder bits of DNA, changing the way it codes for different functions. Doudna and her colleagues published the first paper on the CRISPR system in 2012, showing how it worked in a test tube. Then, in 2013, researchers at the Broad Institute published a paper on using CRISPR in the types of cells found in animals and people.\nBoth institutions filed for patents, and the US Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) initially awarded CRISPR patents to the Broad Institute in 2014. UC Berkeley contested the decision, and the PTO determinedin 2017 that the patents from the two institutions were different enough that they could both stand  and that the Broad Institute retained patents, potentially worth billions for the use of CRISPR in complex human and animal cells. UC Berkeley appealedto the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, DC, and lost that appeal\nThe ruling Monday was the result of another challengeUC Berkeley put before the Patent Trial and Appeal Board in 2019, pitting different CVC patents against the Broad Institutes patents. Once again, the PTO sided with the Broad Institute.\nBiotech companies that initially licensed technology from CVC will likely have to renegotiate with the Broad Institute. Companies that licensed from the Broad Institute, like genome editing company Editas Medicine, are more secure. The decision reaffirms the strength of our foundational intellectual property as we continue our work to develop life-changing medicines for people living with serious diseases, Editas CEO James Mullen said in a statement\nNext Up In\nSign up for the                  newsletter\nVerge Deals\nSubscribe to get the best Verge-approved tech deals of the week.\nJust one more thing!\nPlease confirm your subscription to Verge Deals via the verification email we just sent you.\nEmail\n(required)\nBy signing up, you agree to our Privacy Noticeand European users agree to the data transfer policy.\nSubscribe",

IPT applies to general insurance policies such as home and car insurance and pet insurance.\nIt is a tax on insurers which filters through to the overall costs that customers pay for their policies.\nThe standard IPT rate has undergone a series of increases over the years, rising from 5% to 6% in 2011, to 9.5% in 2015, to 10% in 2016 and finally to 12% in 2017.\nBiba also said it wants to see full IPT relief granted for high-rise homes undergoing or in need of cladding remediation work.\nIt also suggested there should be IPT exemptions for young drivers buying telematics policies, which encourage safe driving.\nCyber insurance could also be made more affordable for small businesses, it added, by making dedicated cyber policies exempt from IPT.\nBiba pointed to research indicating that just 6% of firms have dedicated cyber insurance.\nFor travel insurance, a higher IPT rate of 20% applies  and Biba said this could be reduced as holidaymakers look to book getaways.\nChancellor Rishi Sunak will deliver the Spring Statement on March 23.\nGraeme Trudgill, executive director of Biba, told the PA news agency: Weve got the Spring Statement coming up. The travel insurance and travel sector has been on its knees and travel insurance tax is 20%, whereas normally insurance premium tax on other classes is just 12%.\nSo we would like it to be reduced in line with the headline rate. We do think that the travel sector needs greater support and this would be a welcome step, and also its important to buy travel insurance.\nHe added that cyber attacks are a terrible risk for businesses.\nIf their website gets taken down or their data stolen, cyber insurance can really help with that. It can assist in recovering data, it can help with your reputation, and work with you to get the system back up and running.",

In the best interest of patient safety, the Labor and Delivery unit is on diversion until further notice.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated guidance last month for health care workers, reducing their isolation periods to align with understanding of the disease trajectory, which affected staffing measures.\nThree Aurora Urgent Care facilities in Wisconsin were forced to close last week until at least Jan. 26.\nManaging the COVID surge combined with staffing shortages have contributed to temporary closures at three lower volume urgent care centers in Menomonee Falls, Brookfield and on River Center Drive in Milwaukee, a representative for Advocate Aurora Health told ABC News in a statement. This allows those team members to be deployed to busier urgent cares in the area. All other non-urgent care services offered at these three facilities are currently open.\nPulaski Memorial Hospital in Indiana also told ABC News its closing its OB/Maternity department in mid-January due to staffing shortages.\nWith so few maternity nurses available, our medical staff and senior leadership felt it best to close the OB/Maternity Department instead of trying to operate at less than optimal staffing levels, hospital CEO Tom Barry said in a statement.

Developing innovative software is one thing but tech startups often lack the financial heft to venture into the somewhat dicey hardware side of the equation.\nIn akin's case, related to home hubs, ambient computing and hopefully, further down the line - robotic helpers.\nFor LG, the feeling is mutual as Dr. Sokwoo Rhee, senior vice president for innovation at LG Electronics and head of LG NOVA explains:\nWhen you develop technology with a clear vision and a clear goal, which is going to bring real value to people, thats when its going to have the highest impact.\nToo few companies have this type of vision from the outset while also being fully aligned with the philosophy of our challenge. Thats where we feel akin is different.\nOver the long-term, akin is passionate about hosting its sophisticated high-end chatbot inside a robot, whatever shape that might take, to provide physical support.\nAddressing the greatest need\nFor now, the priority remains in creating a software interface with the intention of easing the cognitive load on family caregivers. The company is adopting a universal design approach by initially honing in on disability use cases.\nRight now, a typical scenario might be that of Emily  a girl with cerebral palsy and mild intellectual impairment.\nEmilys mom might tell the AI that Emily wants to be more independent but is often late for school because she struggles to pack her school bag every day. She also has to be careful, as the bag cant be too heavy on account of her disability.\nThis goal will be relayed to Emilys personal avatar on her tablet who she has specially chosen to have long blue hair. The interface has also been rendered with large buttons to help her navigate better.\nEmilys avatar talks to her differently from mom when she is rushed off her feet in the morning getting the kids to school. Her assistant will remind her to pack her school bag the night before and be careful not to make it too heavy.\nAt the same time, Emilys older brother Jack is reminded by his avatar that its his turn to cook the dinner tomorrow night and the meal plan says its going to be vegetable pasta.\nThe akin interface\nakin\nLiesl Yearsley is CEO of akin and a world-leading artificial intelligence expert. She has founded three successful companies, including Cognea Artificial Intelligence, which was later acquired by IBM Watson.\nTwo of her children live with a disability.\nThe emotional load and level of organizational labor facing families living with a disability are significant, says Yearsley.\nIts around 10-15 hours a week. That is the key problem area we are working on with our software. We want to build an ambient, centralized AI that understands the goals of the family and individual, has empathy and can actualize as well.\nYearsley continues, We feel, in these early days, that we can manage much of this organizational load with software but when the technology gets there, we will have a physical assistance mode too.\nChanging expectations\nAcross wider society, there exists a rapidly expanding business case for help with managing domestic tasks and family affairs, that may not have existed, or at least not been fully appreciated, in previous decades.\nSometimes, when Ive engaged with the investment community  what I hear the most is  I just dont get the problem, says Yearsley.\nThis is because most of them have a chef, a housekeeper, nannies for the kids - a whole entourage that supports their household.But thats not how most of us live. Most people are cutting a 20-40 hour a week job in addition to what has to be done at home.\nFor the last couple of decades, the economics around this type of innovation might not have worked. But what's happening now is 72% of millennials are working parents and millennials are now the largest living generation.\nToday, its not like grandma's time where there is somebody unpaid doing this housework and it not being viewed as an economic cost. We now have this more vocal generation coming through with clearer ideas about the value of their time, says Yearsley.\nWhile the age of the robot butlers or even the super-intelligent Ai voice assistants living in the walls might not yet be upon us, its already a frontier opening up due to the innate desire of us as humans to innovate and explore.\nThats not to forget, the more modern era trend to want to make what we see in sci-fi movies come true in real life.\nThere are many hard yards to cover before we get there but understanding how to interweave technology into the granular and unique dynamics of individual family units seems like the perfect place to start.\nFollow me on",

With 40% of patients turning to digital resources to help manage their chronic conditions, the new digital resource centers will feature healthcare guidance, condition-specific news coverage and living-with information to support patients managing their condition.\nMedisafes new digital resource centers will span multiple therapeutic areas including heart health, cholesterol, migraines, mental health, and several oncology specialties. Through Everyday Health, users can receive industry-leading consumer content, updates, education and tips all within the Medisafe platform.  These new digital resource centers combine convenient health care technology with condition-specific content to assist patients throughout their journey as patients seek more digitally connected care.\nThe launch of the new digital resource centers follows the success Medisafe achieved with its COVID-19 digital resource it launched in June. The COVID-19 Resource Center continues to see strong engagement from the over 8,500 users who enrolled in the program, receiving counseling on COVID misconceptions, recent updates and safety guidelines, and support for patients concerned about the virus.  On average, the COVID-19 Resource Center sees 14 visits per user, 5 visits per month, and nearly 2 visits per day, per user.\nMedisafe users continue to rely on our platform for regular updates since we first deployed Everyday Healths sponsored COVID-19 Resource Center, demonstrating an increased need for centralized resource centers that support many common conditions, said Medisafe Chief Executive Officer Omri Shor. With more patients using digital health tools to manage their health conditions, were excited to expand our platform to present patients with a trusted resource in their pocket and make living with an illness one less worry in the day.\nThis expansion of the platform and the introduction of resource centers positions Medisafe as a trusted utility for patients managing medical conditions.  The new digital resource centers allow users to receive guidance and healthcare education at the point of their consumption, in easily digestible formats. It also creates new connection points for patients to receive support in battling an illness regardless of their specific medication treatment, helping to address social, financial, and emotional challenges.\nBy combining leading healthcare education content with medication management utility, were seeing the next evolution in the healthcare ecosystem with the creation of dedicated, on-demand resources to further support patients as part of their daily healthcare routines, said Nan Forte, Executive Vice President & General Manager, Everyday Health. We believe this latest expansion with Medisafe is a sign of where the industry is headed, with more patient-focused support and guidance, reinforced with information and resources, with future capabilities that deliver care and consultation at the push of a button.\nShare",

        "utterance": "11:00 am, Dec. 25, 2021\nA reflection shows cars filling the Carris Health Surgery Center and Main Clinic parking lots in Willmar in this June 14, 2021, file photo.Erica Dischino / West Central Tribune file photo\nWILLMAR, Minn. Before the pandemic, Dr. Kathryn Deuvel said, she thought west central Minnesota might be turning a corner on the number of overdose deaths.\nBut with the pandemic drug overdoses and deaths in the region and across the country went right back up.\nMinnesotas overdose deaths had decreased in 2018, the numbers rebounded to previous levels in 2019 and skyrocketed in 2020 after the pandemic lockdowns began. Fewer overdoses occurred in rural areas, but the numbers still increased in 2020.\nKathryn Deuvel, Carris Health Addiction Serivces, Willmar\nIt was a wake-up call, said Deuvel, part of a team that started the Addiction Servicesprogram at the\nCarris Health-Willmar Main Clinic\nin April 2020.\nThe timing wasnt ideal, just after the pandemic started, said Holly Morales, a family practice physician assistant on the team.\nPeople didn't know what we had to offer, she said, but as people were referred to the program or heard about it on social media, the staff became increasingly busy.\nHolly Morales, Carris Health Addiction Services, Willmar\nThe program sees patients dealing with all kinds of substance use disorders, whether opioids, alcohol, nicotine, methamphetamine or other other drugs.\nWillmar had not had a program offering medication-assisted treatment until Deuvel, Morales and Dr. Scott Abrams began it. Abrams works with Project Turnabout treatment programs in Granite Falls and also works with inmates in the Stearns County Jail in St. Cloud. Morales also works with Project Turnabout.\nMedication-assisted treatment offering drugs that help curb cravings and reduce withdrawal symptoms can help prevent relapse and maintain abstinence, according to the\nU.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.\nA SAMHSA report lists the ability to offer medication-assisted treatment in primary care settings and not only specialized treatment programs as a key advantage.\nBefore the program in Willmar, people were driving two to three hours to see a doctor who prescribed their medication. The drugs are prescribed as part of a broad program that includes counseling and treatment.\nAddicts still need to work hard to find sobriety, said Abrams, who is a recovering addict.\nIm not going to give you the magical pill thats going to make you sober; I wanted that back in the day, Abrams said.\nDr. Scott Abrams, Carris Health Addiction Services, Willmar\nI would say to anyone, dont come into this thinking youre just going to take a pill and be fine, Abrams said. If you rely on a pill to change your behavior, you will fail every time.\nAbrams is in recovery from an addiction to opioid pain medication. Seven years ago, he lost his job as an emergency physician and his licenses to practice medicine and prescribe drugs.\nAfter he completed a treatment program, the clinic hired him to work in urgent care under close supervision. His licenses have since been restored, and his experiences led him to practice addiction medicine.\nBefore drugs like Suboxone or several others were available locally, some addicts tried to buy them on the streets, Deuvel said.\nThe trouble is theres no quality control from a drug dealer, she said.\nLike many other illegal drugs, they may have had fentanyl in them.\nFentanyl is a very strong drug and a big risk of overdose for people buying illegal drugs. Theres fentanyl in everything, Deuvel said.\nPatients will still have to work hard to overcome their addiction, Abrams said, and the program offers options for them.\nPatients can be referred to several outpatient treatment programs in the area.\nFor those who need to keep their jobs and are trying to keep their families intact, outpatient treatment is an option, he said.\nIt still requires a major commitment three nights a week, but they can stay in their community.\nInpatient treatment is another option.\nSome are worried about losing their jobs if they go to inpatient treatment. Abrams uses himself as an example and tells them that if they keep using, the job has a way of going away on its own.\nMorales said some patients come and go from the program. Some treatment programs in the past were strict with people whove started using again. In Willmar, the idea is to encourage them to try again.\nWhat we hope is they eventually find their way back to us, Morales said. Theyre so used to being chastised for missing appointments. ... Thats not what were about.\nMorales said she developed an interest in treating addiction after conversations with patients in her family practice about their substance use.\nPatients are thankful they can be treated in their local community and that they dont have to feel ashamed if they make a mistake and start using again, Deuvel said.\nIts a group of people who deserve way better treatment than communities and medical systems have given, she said. We dont shame people who have to take high blood pressure meds or have diabetes, why do we have to shame people with opioid addiction.\nThe idea that addicts are seeking quick pleasure is a misconception That part goes away pretty quickly, and then its the avoidance of the negative, Deuvel said.\nIts not a choice, either.\nIf you had your life controlled by a chemical that was hard to get, expensive and caused emotional trauma and shame for you and your family, would you choose to use that, she asked.\nAbrams said most people can come to some understanding of addiction through their own experiences.\nEverybodys got their thing they wish they didn't do that they keep doing, he said.\nIt might be something innocuous, like eating doughnuts or ice cream. The reward pathways in the brain are similar, regardless of the substance.\nIm not going to jail when I eat unhealthy food, its not the same thing, but thats how people can understand, he said.\nDeuvel was asked to develop the program by Dr. Cindy Firkins Smith, the former head of the clinic and now vice president of rural health for Carris Health's parent organization CentraCare.\nSmith asked her to develop a thorough approach for dealing with the problem of opioid addiction and overdoses, Deuvel said.\nDeuvel spent many years at the clinic as an obstetrician/gynecologist. She delivered lots of babies How could you have a better job than that? but physical problems with her hands made it impossible for her to continue in that field.\nShe earned a masters degree in health care delivery and Smith asked her to come back to Willmar to work on quality innovations. For Deuvel, it felt like coming home.\nDeuvel said she looked at prevention, treatment and recovery and found gaps in the system.\nWe developed a toolkit to help decrease the number of opioid prescriptions, she said.\nIts a balancing act, she said, of providing adequate treatment for pain while avoiding prescribing opioids whe",

        "utterance": "The Big Idea\nWHEN HEALTH TECH GETS TOO PERSONAL:\nIf youre one of tens of millions of people tracking calories, alcohol, moods or even ovulation cycles on a smartphone app, beware: Theres little in the law to stop those app makers from sharing personal data with marketers even about pregnancy.\nA recent crackdown on popular menstrual cycle trackers revealed the patchwork state of patient privacy protections and the limited tools at regulators disposal. A proposed Federal Trade Commission settlement with makers of the Flo app over allegedly divulging user data including pregnancy status with Facebook and Google despite assurances that it wouldnt share data sparked a broader debate among FTC commissioners about their authority to police unscrupulous data sharing. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, who is President Joe Bidens pick to lead HHS, last fall fined the makers of a competing fertility app Glow $250,000 for failing to adequately protect data. But consumers wont see a dime from that settlement.\nThese types of apps arent typically broadcasting your health status to other users. But they are routinely handing marketing companies de-identified data for targeted promotions, which experts warn could easily be re-identified or lead to invasive ads.\nAP\nWeak protections:\nAll of the health and fitness wearables were using, all of the apps were using there are very few protections, if any, for them,\" said Emory Roane, policy counsel for the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse.\nConsumers by and large have few options for recourse if they suspect an app isnt protecting their health data, legal experts tell Future Pulse. The FTC and state attorneys general can open investigations into shady practices, but consumers themselves typically cannot sue for privacy violations, FTC Commissioner Noah Phillips said. His agencys proposed settlement with Flo doesnt include financial penalties, as it can only levy fines if a company violates the settlement terms.\nRoane said the Flo case underscores the weakness of the nations health data protections. Its a mess, he said, referring to the privacy protections for health apps that go straight to consumers.\nA vast data ecosystem:\nWebsites and apps routinely share consumers personal data with advertising giants Google and Facebook or other data brokers, often linking it to a users IP address or, in the case of Flo, an Advertising ID. The massive advertising ecosystem uses those consumer profiles to deliver targeted ads based on a persons perceived interests and life circumstances -- for instance, maternity clothes or a new stroller for a person who an algorithm identifies as pregnant. Often these practices are buried in a companys privacy policy and cloaked in dense legalese.\nBut while consumers have become increasingly aware of how companies are leveraging this data, they may falsely believe theyre protected by stringent health care laws governing medical information held by doctors, hospitals and their business associates. But those laws dont apply to data collected by most consumer apps.\nFederal and state health data privacy laws restrict data sharing when its gathered by hospitals and insurers. But consumer apps, as long as theyre not working with companies in the health sector, can gather the same kind of data and produce an equally, or more sensitive profile about you and your health information, said Marc Groman, a senior privacy adviser to former President Barack Obama and the FTCs first chief privacy officer.\nAnd thats not covered by any of those laws, full stop, he said.\nAP Photo\nA changing landscape:\nThe explosion of Covid-related apps from vaccination passports to contact tracing is shaping up to be the most likely target for health-data privacy regulation in Washington. Lawmakers have introduced at least three proposals since the start of the pandemic to give consumers greater control over their personal information and guard against breaches protections that could factor into negotiations over future Covid relief packages.\nBut for anything to pass, Congress would need to resolve familiar sticking points. That includes whether consumers can sue over violations, an approach favored by privacy advocates and many Democrats, and whether a federal law should override state privacy rules. Republicans and industry groups have pushed for the latter, but that idea has met resistance from Democrats, particularly the Houses powerful California delegation.\nPrivacy legislation is a heavy lift even in California, which has the strongest data-privacy law in the nation.\nTwo privacy bills on contact-tracing data died in the state Senatelast year, and Gov. Gavin Newsom last fall vetoed another that aimed to protect the DNA samplesthat consumers mail to testing companies, saying he worried it would interfere with Covid-19-related data reporting. Another bill that would have expanded a state medical information lawto include health data collected by websites and apps also died last summer. The privacy agenda for the session is still taking shape.\nHOW TO BUILD A VAX CAMPAIGN:\nCommunity organizers are mobilizing armies of Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and TikTok users to reassure followers that Covid vaccines are safe as they become available to a wider swath of the general public.\nIts not an easy task. Coordinating messaging, stamping out misinformation and figuring out whose voices are trusted on those different platforms are just some of their early challenges.\nPernessa Seele, head of The Balm In Gilead, says the nonprofit is crafting a vaccine campaign aimed at answering peoples questions without dismissing fears stemming from medical institutions historical mistreatment of minority communities. (Her organization taps faith-based groups to spread public health information, especially to African American communities.)\nWe definitely have to strike a balance around, Why are you concerned, and your concerns are valid, and Why you need to take the vaccine, Seele said. For instance, her organization will directly address the Tuskegee study, in which the government left syphilis untreated in a group of Black men. The reality is many of us living today dont even know what the Tuskegee study was about, as well as the new research guardrails put in place as a result, she said.\nMark Lennihan, Pool/AP Photo\n...Seele is planning a social media campaign on Covid-19\nthat enlists celebrities as well as local community leaders. The person who just took their vaccine in Chicago who runs the neighborhood art gallery is just as important as Bishop Horace Smith, she said, referencing a Chicago megachurch leader.\nBut the content of those messages will vary depending on the targeted\ndemographic. In her experience, Seele says, older people have questions about where and how to get the vaccines. Younger ones are more skeptical about the science, she adds. Older ones flock to Facebook, younger ones to Twitter and Instagram. We have to make sure that those we",

A therapist records conversations with a patient using the app with permission from parents and the child and gets feedback into their state of mind. Its speech analysis technology was created by researcher John Pestian of Cincinnati Childrens Hospital, using language patterns compiled from a database of more than 1,000 suicide letters as well as voice recordings taken from hospitals and emergency rooms in the Cincinnati area and West Virginia. The early trials show it is at least as effective as specialists at distinguishing between fake and fabricated suicide notes and in many cases, is actually better. One day, Wright hopes the technology will be able to pinpoint the best treatments too, the way doctors can recommend medicine or lifestyle changes to help address a heart attack.\nIt was hardly a given that Wright would make his mark in the Midwest. After graduating from Cincinnatis Xavier University with a computer science major and a business minor, he easily could have headed to Silicon Valley. Beginning his career at AT&Ts Bell Laboratories, the soccer lover worked a dozen years in product development for Seattle-based software company Attachmate and another three for Boston-based ProfitLogic but always keeping his home base in Cincinnati. Eventually, he found the most success and meaning by tapping into his hometowns budding entrepreneurial community. Of Assurex, he says, The most important thing that product ever did was get people off medications that would make them worse.\nWright is reluctant to make Clarigents story personal, instead referencing facts and stats, figures and tests. There are more problems to be worked out. Questions remain about whether regional accents say, the Southern drawl or New Englands dropped Rs will influence the app, or even how close the recorder should be to get an accurate reading. Should the app take video to interpret body language, or will patients be less open on camera?",

The CIRM-funded study led by Dr. Krystof Bankiewicz, is one of the 64 clinical trials funded by the California state agency to date.\nParkinsons is a neurodegenerative movement disorder that affects one million people in the U.S alone and leads to shaking, stiffness, and problems with walking, balance, and coordination. It is caused by the breakdown and death of dopaminergic neurons, special nerve cells in the brain responsible for the production of dopamine, a chemical messenger that is crucial for normal brain activity.\nThe patient was treated at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center with a gene therapy designed to promote the production of a protein called GDNF, which is best known for its ability to protect dopaminergic neurons, the kind of cell damaged by Parkinsons. The treatment seeks to increase dopamine production in the brain, alleviating Parkinsons symptoms and potentially slowing down the disease progress.\nWe are pleased to support this multi-institution California collaboration with Ohio State to take a novel first-in-human gene therapy into a clinical trial for Parkinsons Disease. says Maria T. Millan, M.D., President and CEO of CIRM. This is the culmination of years of scientific research by the Bankiewicz team to improve upon previous attempts to translate the potential therapeutic effect of GDNF to the neurons damaged in the disease. We join the Parkinsons community in following the outcome of this vital research opportunity.\nCIRM Board Member and patient advocate David Higgins, Ph.D. is also excited about this latest development. For Dr. Higgins, advocating for Parkinsons is a very personal journey since he, his grandmother, and his uncle were diagnosed with the disease.\nOur best chance for developing better treatments forParkinsons is to test as many logical approaches aspossible. CIRM encourages out-of-the-box thinking byproviding funding for novel approaches. The Parkinsons community is a-buzz withexcitement about the GDNF approach and looks to CIRM to identify, fund, and promote these kinds of programs.\nIn a news release Dr. Sandra Kostyk, director of the Movement Disorders Divisionat Ohio State Wexner Medical Center said this approach involves infusing a gene therapy solution deep into a part of the brain affected by Parkinsons: This is a onetime treatment strategy that could have ongoing lifelong benefits. Though its hoped that this treatment will slow disease progression, we dont expect this strategy to completely stop or cure all aspects of the disease. Were cautiously optimistic as this research effort moves forward.\nOther trial sites located in California that are currently recruiting patients are the University of California, Irvine (UCI) and the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). Specifically, the Irvine trial site is using the UCI Alpha Stem Cell Clinic one of five leading medical centers throughout California that make up the CIRM Alpha Stem Cell Clinic (ASSC) Network.

        "utterance": "Email\nFew verticals are as vital or as global as the chemical industry, where the raw materials that cross borders find their way into everything from computer chips to potato chips. Shortages of those chemicals and bottlenecks in supply chains ultimately translate into shortages on shelves of everything from beauty products to paint cans.\nAnd yet, the chemical buying process itself, in which buyers connect with suppliers, place orders and get them fulfilled, is archaic and paper based. As ChemDirectCEO Tyler Ellisontold Karen Webster, Its extraordinarily opaque.\nIts a highly fragmented market, too, said Ellison, marked by $6 trillion in sales volume but where even major players have low single-digit market share.\nIts also marked by intermediaries including distributors, so transparency into end demand (and supply) is, to put it mildly, less than optimal. There are any number of causes of friction in the supply chain, said Ellison, tied to regulatory and political events everything from pandemics to production disruptions to tariffs.\nThe inefficient sales cycles can be improved considerably, he said, with two-sided automated, direct and digital marketplaces that bring buyers and sellers online in an experience that changes not just sourcing and price discovery, but the entire procurement process.\nThe urgency is there, and Ellison said ChemDirects genesis stems from his own time as CEO of a chemicals manufacturing company that led to frustration with lack of visibility into end markets and the multiple steps involved in getting orders in place.\nThe conversation came amid ChemDirects announcement earlier this month that it had launched version 2.0 of its website, with enhanced point, click and buy capabilities, as well as faster delivery speeds.\nIn terms of mechanics, as the platform is embedded into enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems via application programming interfaces (APIs), a chemical buyer can shop on the marketplace for the best pricing from verified chemical suppliers and manufacturers. The manufacturers, he said, are vetted (internally) by the platform (additional verification and security checks come from the payments partners).\nSuppliers are given a digital storefront at no cost, allowing buyers to shop directly and access those suppliers marketing materials and accreditation certificates. Along the way, he said, eliminating the distributors from the equation (and from the marketplace) allows those suppliers to build up their brands as they become known and trusted by the buyers.\nFinding the Tipping Point\nIn constructing the marketplace, which debuted last year and took six months to build, once wed reached that tipping point, the customer acquisition has been very good, said Ellison.\nHe added that the most recent enhancement of the site serves all manner of buyers and suppliers, from larger firms down to technical buyers (who scout for chemicals with different characteristics and even impurities) to occasional buyers who might be considered long tail users.\nThe companys platform also has payments functionality built in. Ellison noted that ChemDirect has partnered with Balance, a B2B payments firm, and Stripe to offer terms across a range of payments optionality, from ACH to cards. The payments functionality built into the platform allows payments to be staged based on certain milestones or approvals and receipts.\nAnd in a departure from what seems to be the fashion du jour no blockchain or cryptocurrencies are in the mix.\nThe Logistics Puzzle\nBeyond payments, Ellison said that one key failing of most B2B eCommerce sites centers on the fulfillment side of the equation. The average time till fulfillment in the chemicals space lasts anywhere from 12 to 20 weeks; the average fulfillment time with ChemDirect is three and a half days.\nOne of the of the things weve learned about institutional buyers is that they like a permission-based system, he said. If youre the procurement director, you might have 15,000 of monthly permissions to buy, and weve digitized that whole process. Knitting together a more digital value chain and skipping all those steps benefits everybody.\nThat shortened fulfillment time has positive ripple effects up and down supply chains as firms cut down on their inventory and re-ordering costs, he said.\nIn the future, the platform will continue to bring buyers and sellers together globally, with focus on the largest production regions in Asia, including India and China, and the largest consumption regions, marked by the U.S. and western Europe, he said.\nFurther advances in payments will be tied to continued efforts to understand the processes and constraints around foreign producers. As Ellison said: Some of them need prepayments, others do not. Still other firms can forward position inventory under a range of terms. We need to map out workflows before we overlay solutions.\nMonetizing the Data\nThe wealth of data accumulated on the platform across buyers and sellers can hint at changes in the market in the surpluses or shortages that loom. Case in point: Ellison recounted how in the early throes of the pandemic, isopropyl alcohol (and all the things that go into it) saw spikes in demand in the thousands of percentage points. In March of last year, ChemDirect was among the only places that had access to isopropyl alcohol. Passing the demand data along to the manufacturer allowed it to adjust its production.\nWe consider ourselves the demand scouts of the industry, he said, with data that may be, eventually, monetized while creating a B2C experience in a B2B marketplace.",

The sofa he was sitting in was the same colour as the one we used to have.\nProject We Forgot founder and Homage's head of community and outreach Melissa Chan at the latter's office. (Photo: Alvin Teo)\nThat incident, along with many others as she, her siblings and their mother struggled to care for her father, would eventually prompt the 28-year-old Singaporean to start a social enterprise for dementia caregivers and, later, join an even bigger start-up with bigger aspirations.\nGIVING SUPPORT FOR CAREGIVERS\nFounded shortly after Melissa's father passed away in 2014, the much-lauded Project We Forgothas been actively functioning as a kind of support group for caregivers of persons with dementia, through online forums, workshops and other activities.\nMelissa Chan with volunteers and members of Project We Forgot. (Photo: Project We Forgot>\nIt was community that her family didnt have back then. As a family, we never spoke about it. My mother was struggling to figure out what was happening to her husband, and care for us, said Melissa. Id cancel appointments with friends because I felt a sense of guilt. I decided not to go overseas for education because a part of me worried that my father would forget who I was when I came back.\nOne lightbulb moment to start PWF would also come from an unlikely source: Comedian Seth Rogen.\nHes seen as someone super funny but I saw him speaking in (US) Congress about dementia his wifes mother had it and the two of them had to care for her. I was very impressed because he was using a different way to educate them about the condition, and the struggles of caregivers,\" she said.\n\"I realised there was nothing like that in Singapore. When you Google, you see Western faces. Any information was very medical, and research papers. But its a very human journey.\"\nStarting PWF entailed a sharp career detour. Melissa had previously worked in the hospitality and tech industries (in marketing and communications for W Hotels and later, a travel tech start-up) but both experiences proved crucial.\nI realised that at the end of the day, its about taking (complicated information) and making it accessible for people to digest.\nShe and her PWF team turned to social media after discovering there were caregivers overseas who were using Instagram as a platform. They were sharing stories, talking about day-to-day experiences, videoing themselves about their struggles.\nAnd it worked. Today, PWF continues to organise activities in Singapore (most recently a dementia-friendly design-a-thon at the National Design Centre) and they are aiming to grow in Malaysia, where theyre holding a film event in time for World Alzheimers Month this September. Alzheimer's contributes a large percentage to cases of dementia, which is an umbrella term, said Melissa.\nThey have have also gotten support from organisations like the National Youth Council, Alzheimer's Disease Association and Singtel, which had named it one of its Future Makers start-up companies in 2017.\nCONNECTING CAREGIVERS AND THE ELDERLY\nBut PWF was just the start of her advocacy. Early this year, Melissa also joined Homage another local start-up that is also expanding to Malaysia, which helps connect caregivers with the elderly and their family.\nI decided not to go overseas for education because a part of me worried that my father would forget who I was when I came back.\nFor Melissa, whos now also head of Homages community and outreach, it was a chance to offer something that PWF could not.\nWeve been doing the emotional well-being support (for caregivers at PWF) and now, Homage has a platform to provide on-demand care (for patients).\nIn a nutshell, said Melissa, it's something like Grab but for elderly care.\nThe company has a pool of care professionals, or \"Care Pros\", that people can tap into by using an app or going online, whether its to send a loved one for a medical check-up or simply to look after them at home.\nProject We Forgot founder Melissa Chan is now also head of community and outreach at Homage, which connects caregivers with the elderly. (Photo: Alvin Teo)\nTHE IMPORTANCE OF TECHNOLOGY\nIt might seem strange to be bringing up technology when talking about an issue where physical, human interaction is whats most vital, but Melissa says being connected has actually become crucial as the population ages and families become smaller and often busy at work.\nThere is a need to shift the way care is delivered, especially if youre looking at the topic of longterm care for an ageing population, she said. If a family needs a caregiver in the next two days, can they get it or do they wait two to three weeks, for example.\nWhenever I think of services at Homage, I think about how my family couldve used it just a few hours to ensure that someone was home to watch over my dad.\nOn top of that, people who are tech-savvy will want information at their fingertips its no longer just putting a parent in a nursing home or with a caregiver and not knowing whats happening for a few hours. Just knowing how your parent is doing there is a big role for technology to play in this space,\" said Melissa.\nFor example, being connected means one can be updated on how the medical appointment or house visit went without being physically there. And the Care Pros, too, can access previous information about the client-patient through the app so theyre prepared before even entering the home.\nThe Homage app lets you book a caregiver for your family member. (Photo: Homage)\nThe current pool of Care Pros number around 1,000, which is a mix of nurses, therapists and non-nurses who are able to provide support. And theyre in-demand. Every hour were delivering care right now, Melissa told CNA Lifestyle.\nJoining Homage also resonated with Melissa on a very personal level.\nWhile taking care of her father, there were times when the familys schedules wouldnt sync and they had to sometimes resort to locking him up at home.\nIt was dangerous and we knew it wasnt the right thing to do, but it was our only option sometimes, she said, sadly.\nMelissa C",

        "utterance": "Save\nBy Chad Hayes, Chief Technology Officer and Director of E-Recycling, Sadoff E-Recycling & Data Destruction Co.\nReducing the amount of e-waste generated globally and managing its disposal have become major concerns of special interest groups, industry and governments alike, and yet many individuals fail to see the impact these issues have on them.\nE-waste brings the same environmental problems as waste that is traditionally incinerated, dumped at sea or buried in landfills such as pollution, habitat destruction and the loss of resources. It also brings additional concerns:\n Environment  E-waste contains a long list of chemicals that are harmful to people and the environment.\n Resources  E-waste contains precious metals like gold and platinum, as well as elements like cobalt and neodymium. There is a finite supply of these resources and its dwindling rapidly.\n Human rights  E-waste is often illegally exported to countries that dont have applicable laws. Once stripped of valuable materials, the remainder is left to pollute the land, air and water of local citizens.\n Data security  Computing equipment makes up a large portion of the total e-waste produced. The data storage devices inside often contain sensitive information that can have significant detrimental effects when in the wrong hands.\nWhy do special interest groups, industry and governments care about e-waste?\nFor special interest groups, issues pertaining directly to them are always top-of-mind. Their activism serves as the catalyst for governments to take legislative action. Since organizations have a vested interest in the resulting laws, they prepare in advance for complying with the new regulations. The challenge then becomes convincing private citizens to comply with these laws and best practices.\nWhy should individuals care about e-waste?\nAs the world continues to get smaller, a regional issue can quickly develop into a global issue with far-reaching effects. This is especially true with e-waste:\n Environmental issues are more acutely felt as larger areas encounter tainted air, water and food.\n Rare resources will only become scarcer and costlier to acquire.\n Human rights violations will continue. Thankfully, the global economy provides new opportunities to enforce international law.\n Data security is a major concern as we become more connected. Certified data destruction soon will be a necessity, but are there enough providers to do the job?\nWhat can I do to reduce e-waste?\nThe three keys to addressing e-waste are education, influence and action. Look for opportunities to make\nan impact at a grassroots level:\n1. Education  Share your knowledge with others.\n2. Influence  Model behavior that is conducive to solving e-waste problems.\n3. Action  Take simple actions that make a huge difference.\n Buy only EPEAT registered products.\n Boycott companies that turn a blind eye to human rights violations.\n Vote for lawmakers who embrace e-waste management.\n Help develop e-waste policies in your organization.\n Patronize your local e-recycling company.\nThe question isnt if e-waste reduction and management will happen, its when. As our world becomes more polluted, natural resources dwindle, more people suffer social injustice and lives are ruined by data breaches, change will become a necessity.\nIf youre ready to make a difference in your world, check out SEDDs website and blog for ways you can help solve e-waste issues in your family, organization and community.\nAbout the Author\nChief Technology Officer and\nDirector of E-recycling, Sadoff E-Recycling & Data Destruction Co.\nChad Hayes is the chief technology officer and director of e-recycling at Sadoff E-Recycling & Data Destruction. He joined Sadoff Iron and Metal in 2015, and oversees the strategic planning and implementation of IT. With his extensive 20-plus years of IT and business leadership experience and a passion for data security, he was the perfect choice to establish, build and lead the Sadoff E-Recycling & Data Destruction Company, a company of Sadoff Iron and Metal.

Credit: AG Mormann/Uni Bonn\nShould I or shouldn't I? The activity of individual nerve cells in the brain tells us how confident we are in our decisions. This is shown by a recent study by researchers at the University of Bonn. The result is unexpectedthe researchers were actually on the trail of a completely different evaluation mechanism. The results are published in the journal\nCurrent Biology\n.\nYou are sitting in a caf and want to enjoy a piece of cake with your cappuccino. The Black Forest gateau is just too rich for you and is therefore quickly eliminated. Choosing between the carrot cake and the rhubarb crumble is much trickier: The warm weatherfavors the refreshingly fruity cake. Carrot cake, however, is one of your all-time favorites. So what to do?\nEvery day we have to make decisions, and we are much more confident about some of them than others. Researchers at the University Hospital Bonn have now identified nerve cells in the brain whose activity indicates the confidence in decisions. A total of twelve men and women took part in their experiment. \"We showed them photos of two different snacks, for example a chocolate bar and a bag of chips,\" explains Prof. Dr. Dr. Florian Mormann from the Department of Epileptology. \"They were then asked to use a slider to indicate which of these alternatives they would rather eat.\" The more they moved the slider from its center position towards the left or right photo, the more confident they were in their decision.\nUltra-fine electrodes implanted in the temporal lobes of epileptic patients enable researchers to visualize the activity of individual nerve cells. Credit: Christian Burkert\nFire rate and confidence are related\nParticipants had to judge a total of 190 different snack pairs in this way. At the same time, the scientists recorded the activity of 830 nerve cells each in the so-called temporal lobe. \"We discovered that the frequency of the electrical pulses in some neurons, in other words their 'firing rate', changed with increasing decision confidence,\" explains Mormann's colleague Alexander Unruh-Pinheiro. \"For instance, some fired more frequently, the more confident the respective test person was in their decision.\"\nIt is the first time that such a correlation between activity and decision confidence has been identified. The affected neurons are located in a brain region that plays a role in memory processes. \"It is possible that we not only store what decision we made, but also how confident we were in it,\" speculates Mormann. \"Perhaps such a learning process saves us from future wrong decisions.\"\nEthical reasons usually prohibit the study of the state of individual neurons in living humans. However, the participants in the study suffered from a severe form of epilepsy. In this form of the disease, the characteristic seizures always start in the same area of the brain. One possible treatment is therefore to remove this epileptic focus surgically. To pinpoint the exact location of the defective site, the doctors at the Clinic for Epileptology implant several electrodes in the patient. These are distributed over the entire potentially affected area. At the same time, they also allow an insight into the functioning of individual nerve cells in the brain.\nResearchers at the University of Bonn were originally looking for a completely different phenomenon: When we make a decision, we assign a subjective value to each of the alternatives. \"There is evidence that this subjective value is also reflected in the activity of individual neurons,\" says Mormann. \"The fact that we instead came across this connection between fire behavior and decisionconfidence surprised even us.\"\nExplore further\nMore information: Alexander Unruh-Pinheiro et al, Single-Neuron Correlates of Decision Confidence in the Human Medial Temporal Lobe,\nCurrent Biology",

The steps are part of the firm's shift away from a heavy focus on COVID related vaccines and therapeutics, to a new lineup of promising investments in the biotech space.\nThessalus CEO Dr. Mitchell Ng\nDr. Jason Ngo, newly appointed to Thessalus Capital Advisory Board\n\"When COVID began in\nMarch 2020\n, our physician-managed investment firm was one of the first to recognize the huge market potential in companies developing treatments for this unprecedented health crisis,\" says Thessalus Managing Director and President, Dr.\nMitchell Ng\n.  \"We bet big on companies developing COVID vaccines and therapeutics, like Moderna (MRNA), Regeneron (REGN), and Pfizer (PFE).\"\n\"We maintained significant positions and are very happy with how those played out,\" says Dr. Ng. Moderna was the biggest winner, going from little-known startup to premier global developer of mRNA vaccines. Its stock price rose 800% since\nJanuary 2020\n. Stock prices of Regeneron and Pfizer, which developed a COVID antibody treatment and COVID mRNA vaccine, respectively, saw similarly eye-popping gains.\nNevertheless, with COVID moving to endemic status, Thessalus is reaching the \"end of the road with regards to its COVID play,\" says Ng. \"We're closing positions and re-focusing on our pre-pandemic biotech lineup including CRISPR gene editing technologies, CAR-T cancer immunotherapies, monoclonal antibody treatments, among others.\"\nTo that end, says Managing Director Dr.\nKenneth Ng\n, the firm is appointing Dr.\nJason Ngo\nto its Advisory Board.\n\"Dr. Ngo is one of the best analysts of midsize biotech market caps I've encountered in my medical career. Being a research-heavy fund as we are, Jason did outstanding work for us reviewing Phase III clinical trials and identifying specific M&A activity in orphan drug ventures.  He played a real role in our successful investment in Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX).\"\n\"This appointment is a resounding vote of confidence in Jason's abilities,\" Ng concludes.  \"Overall, these recent steps are a milestone, marking the end of a successful chapter in our fund, and first, exciting steps to ensure continued growth and expansion in coming years.\"\nAbout Thessalus Capital LLC:\nThessalus is a leading, \"content strong\" investment firm specializing in US and international life science industries. It takes a global, research-heavy approach, with narrow and deep focus on pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, diagnostic tools, and medical devices.

The primary aim is to define a tailored set of evidence-based metrics to transform performance across the entire Maternity Care Pathway.\nNNUH has moved from a paper-based auditing system, to measuring quality improvements digitally. The results show the Perfect Ward solution has helped to halve the time needed to perform audits while empowering staff to deliver outstanding maternity care across the pathway.\nYvonne Christley, Deputy Chief Nurse at Norfolk and Norwich University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust commented, For us the biggest benefit of using Perfect Ward is its ability to capture everything visually and the tagging functionality is great. At a glance, we can see metrics for every part of the maternity care pathway, by division and across the whole organisation.\nIt gives us rich and vivid data that is simple and easy to interpret. Audits can be now be done in half the time, hugely important when our target for audits is 20 minutes during this critical first phase. We could never have embarked on such an ambitious programme without an effective digital system like Perfect Ward.\nWhile eliminating the heavy administrative burden associated with auditing and giving staff extra time to look after patients, the transparency of the Perfect Ward mobile solution empowers staff by promoting accountability. Staff have truly engaged with the technology because they see the immediate results of their audits and are keen to share their success stories.\nAlan Birch, Chief Commercial Officer at Perfect Ward added, Perfect Ward's solution is perfectly designed to support bespoke and transformational quality programmes across NHS hospitals and all health and social care environments in these challenging times. Using mobile devices, managers have complete control of their quality metrics on the move, can view the results of live audits as they are completed and make meaningful improvements accordingly. For frontline staff, our technology is a powerful motivational tool making their roles easier, more engaging and helping to unleash their full potential.\nThe next step for NNUH is to test the new metrics and gain valuable patient feedback by involving the mothers themselves. December 2020 sees the launch of the Maternity Departments first Continuity of Care Team with the goal of having one full audit across the entire patient journey. Until now, nurses typically carried out their own individual audits for the mothers in their care. However, the success of the new project has inspired the team to utilise audits as a valuable vehicle for sharing learning and outstanding practice, along with areas that may require improvement.\nProfessor Nancy Fontaine, Chief Nurse at Norfolk and Norwich University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust concluded, Working with Perfect Ward is a pleasure. We benefit from an excellent working relationship and great communication allowing us to adapt our audits as required. I would have no hesitation in advocating Perfect Ward for its ease of use and powerful reporting to other organisations.\nNNUH expects to share the results of the next phase of its quality programme in the near future.

What gives?\nSo what\ncommon theme across\nthe consumer goods industry. Clorox's third-quarter gross margin dropped to 42.8% from 44% as a result. Yet, the company earned 5% higher net profit year over year on lower taxes and 3% growth in sales. More importantly, Clorox upgraded its full-year sales guidance to the higher end of its previous range of 1%-3%. On the flip side, it downgraded its fiscal 2018 earnings per share (EPS) outlook to $6.15-$6.30 from $6.17-$6.37. There's nothing to worry here, though.\nImage source: Clorox Company.\nIn March, Clorox announced plans to acquire health and wellness company, Nutranext for $700 million, to be financed through cash and debt. While Clorox expects the acquisition to add a percentage point to its top line this year (hence the revenue outlook upgrade), acquisition-related expenses are expected to dilute its earnings.\nInvestors were encouraged by Clorox's resilience amid challenging cost conditions. To top that, the company announced a share repurchase program worth $2 billion later in May, reflecting management's confidence in its long-term goals, which include 3%-5% growth in annual sales and conversion of 11%-13% annual revenue into free cash flows.\nRising cash flows should also mean higher dividends for shareholders: Clorox has already made a mark in the dividend world as a\nand rewarded shareholders with a good 14% increase in dividends earlier this year.\nSo what\nClorox's full-year outlook, after the downgrade, calls for a solid 16% growth in EPS at the midpoint. While the Nutranext acquisition is unlikely to be accretive before fiscal 2020, Clorox should still be able to grow its EPS at a decent clip next year. The growth potential in earnings and dividend, coupled with the buyback program, was good enough for the market to propel Clorox shares higher last month.\nMotley Fool Returns",

The pioneers of fermented whole foods and herbal supplements Paul and Barbi Schulick built one of the most successful nutraceutical brands in the industry. New Chapter helped change the paradigm for the supplement market at large and was eventually bought by Procter & Gamble in 2012.\nThe mission for the Schulicks continues today with For The Biome, a wellness company focused on raising awareness about the connection between physical health, mental well-being, and the environment.\nIn this interview, For The Biome Founder and CEO Paul Schulick discusses the new venture, the microbiome, and offers some advice for budding entrepreneurs.\nBeauty IO (BIO): What principles is the company founded on? Whats your mission and vision?\nPaul Schulick: Theres a Chinese proverb that says, Where there is pain there is no connection. Where there is connection there is no pain. If we can help ease pain and amplify connection, weve done our jobs.\nWere a wellness company raising consciousness around health, mental well-being, and our connection with the global biome. We aim to influence awakening within the self, the larger community, and the planet while retaining a radically honest ethos.\nOur foundational principle of treating as a whole to heal as whole has evolved into what we call True Holism. Our three-pronged approach supports connection of the mind, body, and community with freely offered live and guided meditation, skin care that leverages the skin-microbiome relationship, and an integrated philanthropic effort that donates at least 3% of every purchase to organizations supporting climate change reversal, sustainable housing, and empowering women.\nThe bond we share with our customers will play a key role in the realization of our vision, and to further support that bond, our True Transparency program will pull back the curtain on all production costs, pricing models, and sourcing information. We believe that the ultimate connection is only achieved when all our pathways are open\nand accessible.\nBIO: How has the company been developing?\nSchulick: We are moving quickly. Our website, www.forthebiome.com, will offer live and guided meditation programs as well as our Sentient Skincare product line.\nOur skin care is rooted in a deep respect for the skin and its microbiome as the third brain. The microbial universe that lives in and on the skin contains the wisdom and beneficial adaptations from past generations. We believe that when your microbiome flourishes, these generational lessons are passed on to your skin.\nSentient Skincare offers a simple three-step system to help do just that with exclusively whole ingredients and 100% active formulas that are capable of carrying robust conversations with both the skin and its microbiome. Essentially, this gives your skin and microbiome a legacy instruction manual for holistic protection and preservation.\nOur fermented and CO2 volcanic extracted bioactives help balance the skins environment, recalibrating where necessary, and maintaining whats already working. As a result, signaling pathways are primed as energized skin cells and a biodiverse microbiome takes root. Once this happens, connection is restored between the skin, its microbiome, and the rest of the body. Crosstalk between all systems is restored and nerves receive adaptogenic therapy that results in the skin looking and feeling healthier.\nWith no fillers or preservatives, we hope to initiate a new generation of clean beauty that leverages skin-microbiome harmony for a naturally radiant complexion.\nWere investing heavily in certifications and cellular and clinical studies to further validate our products and are thrilled with the results were seeing. From blue light protection to an adaptogenic effect on neuroendocrine markers like cortisol and oxytocin, these products are delivering the aesthetic benefits consumers seek with an additional layer of mind-body acknowledgement. Weve also received our vegan, organic, EWG, and cruelty-free certifications and are the first to receive an ONLA certification that validates our cleanser as microbiome-friendly. Additional certifications are in progress and this will remain a commitment to help consumers easily identify our standards.\nBIO: How has understanding of the microbiome evolved? What are you most excited about for the future?\nSchulick: Recent research published by Tel Aviv University has led many scientists to challenge Darwins theory of evolution. The proposed hologenome theory of evolution suggests that microbial genes and human genes come together to form a hologenome, where human genes are dramatically outnumbered by microbial genes. As the human genome evolves, the microbiome acts as our co-pilot, supplying a dynamic response to external stimuli. This partnership between human and microbial cells drives our evolution and is essential to how humans have adapted since the beginning of time.\nFast forward to today. The skin-microbiome relationship continues to play a crucial role in the health and function of our systems. Acting as a network over a network, your microbiome supports your skins sensory abilities while helping support barrier function. The result is skin that fully realizes its ability to see, hear, and even elicit shifts in emotion. You simply arent whole or functioning at peak capacity without a healthy skin-microbiome relationshipbut when its healthy, your skin can effectively function as your bodys third brain.\nGiven all the wisdom that resides in the microbiome, its cataclysmic to the behavior of your skin and body to strip yourself of this critical, living layer. Yet we do it regularly. Harsh skin care products, unhealthy lifestyles, pollution, and especially mental stress take their toll on our skin and microbiomes. Taking it one step further, both your skin and microbiome have a bilateral relationship with nature, and changes in the environment like the climate crisis, UV radiation, and pollution can elicit a chemical stress response in the skin which generates a variety of mood-shifting hormones and neurotransmitters. These shifts can block the crosstalk between your skin and microbiome, dulling the skins intrinsic barrier function and rejuvenating abilities. Its in this relationship between skin, microbiome, and the environment that we see the onset of the climate crisis as an additional skin-microbiome disruption that we must address.\nWere excited to introduce ingredients to the market that address this dynamic and send a friendly ripple through the biomesimultaneously supporting the skin and microbiome through topical application while uplifting the global macrobiome through obsessive sourcing practices and philanthropic efforts to ultimately, again, influence the health of your skin and microbiome.\nAll our ingredients support this cycle with our sourcing commitment of R.O.S.E.S.: all our ingredients must be reliable, organic, sustainab",

A celebration of the theme, Free Your Mind, the fair is showcasing a range of artworks and experiences across a range of different styles, with works of 120+ solo artists and galleries from 20+ countries.\nAfter months of virtual exhibitions and Zoom openings, the artists, buyers, organisers, and visitors, had a field day out, as they attended the events for the day, including live art walks and painting sessions. In addition, the visitors took part in various workshops like learning button mosaic and paper collage skills. The three curators, incidentally all women, Batool Jafri, Samar Kamel, and Petra Kaltenbach, expressed their happiness and hope at the response, \"Until this noon, we were not sure of what to expect but within 20 minutes of the opening, we were certain of the event's success.\"\nAmong the many new features, this year are the digital art display, Urban Art DXB and a dedicated zone for sculptures and photographers. A wall with psychedelic colours, inspired by Alexa Meade and curated by Batool and Samar, a perfect Instagram friendly space to sit and get clicked was one of the most-visited (and sanitised, each time a person sat and left!) spot on day one! With only one or two visitors allowed in the art booths at a time, and floor stickers with words like, \"Social Distancing Expert\" and \"Wear your masks at all times,\" it was remarkable to note how the fair kept responsibility at its core mission.\nFor those looking to invest in art or simply adorn their homes with canvases, there are ample choices to select from works ranging in prices between $100 - $20,000. \"World Art Dubai remains an extremely innovative show that embraces every corner of the art world. We are leading the region's charge for the restart of events and have curated a show that embraces the latest trends while celebrating art traditions,\" said Trixie LohMirmand, Executive Vice President, Exhibitions  &  Events Management, DWTC.\nAll the venue entry points are equipped with thermal scanning, along with smart cameras to ensure social distancing protocols. The venue is getting regularly sanitised and hand sanitisers are available throughout the venue. All visitors are required to wear a mask at all times. The event is on until Saturday (1 pm to 9 pm), visitors can pre-book their tickets worldartdubai.com.\nA year of creativity and opportunity\nA. P. Laitu, one of the participating artists at World Art Expo 2020, said that this has been an unprecedented year in the history of mankind and did not even leave the art world untouched.\nHe added that at the same the year would be remembered as a year of creativity and opportunity. \"It gave us all ample time to create some good art.\" He shared that he is grateful to World Art Dubai for giving the artists the much-awaited platform to showcase their creativity and also meet and greet fellow artists from all over the world. \"This platform is also the evaluation of how constructively we all have spent our time during this period of lockdown and isolation.\"\nWhat is arty-fash style statement?\nIndividuality is the key, and while many of us wish to make a personal statement, we find it hard to express ourselves via colours, shapes and images. At Artify Station by multi-disciplinary artist Ella Orencillo, you can get a bespoke pair of shoes, a cap or a cloth bag, as the artist helps you define your style.\nElla, a Filipino, has been in Dubai for 13 years now. She quit her job in 2017 to be a full-time artist and started her company, Craftology, last year. \"I'd been pursuing art on the side, all this while though, as I worked as a receptionist, personal assistant, executive assistant, etc.\" She hand-painted a bag with Khaleej Times written in signature blue colour. \"People want to be different and have good ideas, but are unable to translate the same visually. I want to be their go-to-person to help them express themselves via accessories. I'll execute them for you on clothing and more.\"\nMENAFN0910202000490000ID1100929509\nLegal Disclaimer:\nMENAFN provides the information as is without warranty of any kind.

The magic of #photogrammetry, 3D Scanning, & many cameras @MadMaxGame. pic.twitter.com/gIjzC3zM54 WENDY W FOK |  (@W_W_F) February 7, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tweet shows digital researcher Wendy W. Fox at Avalanches New York offices, having her face scanned using photogrammetry cameras, for what she describes as Mad Max 2.\n\n\n\nThe photo was apparently taken before the pandemic but other than stating that her face would have been used for a rebel character theres no information on what the game is and whether its still in development.\n\n\n\nIt is possible she may have been mistaken about what game she was been scanned for, as Avalanche also worked on the Mad Max-esque Rage 2. However, that was released in May 2019 and so unless shes underplaying how much earlier this was before the pandemic started, it doesnt seem likely that it was that.\n\n\n\n3D scanning technology was not used for the original Mad Max, in fact its poor quality character models were a notable flaw, so it does make sense that it would be something that Avalanche would want to improve in a sequel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheres also recently been talk of a new Mad Max film, a prequel focusing on the Furiosa character from Fury Road, thats supposed to start production this year.\n\n\n\nThat would certainly be a good reason to start work on a new game and while the tweet doesnt make any claim that the sequel is still in development  so it could have been cancelled  its certainly enough to remain hopeful.\n\n\n\nAvalanche is currently working on Xbox console exclusive Contraband for Microsoft but theyre big enough to have two major games in production at once, with the original Mad Max releasing the same year as Just Cause 3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail gamecentral@metro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter.\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\tMORE : Fortnite leaks point to Mad Max crossover following Season 7 finale\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\tMORE : Mad Max review  Fallout on wheels\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\tMORE : Mad Max preview and interview  Australian U-turn\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\nFollow Metro Gaming on Twitter and email us at gamecentral@metro.co.uk\n\n\n\nFor more stories like this,check our Gaming page.",

Ammann could not immediately be reached for comment.\nHe joined GM as treasurer in 2010 and helped lead the companys initial public offering following its 2009 restructuring. At Exxon, he will lead its energy transition business, which oversees efforts to generate new revenue from carbon sequestration technologies and hydrogen production.

Some stand out as winners of the 2021 Bethpage Best of Long Island contest.\nThe winners include Medford Volunteer Ambulance, which won the title of Best Medical Transportation Company on Long Island, and Stony Brook University Hospital, which won the title of Best Maternity Ward on Long Island.\nEach of these health organizations rose to the top in their response to Covid from the onset and their medical and supportive personnel displayed their outstanding skills, fortitude, and temperament to save and impact lives. So, what defines a health care hero? Read on to see what these outstanding institutions and their top-notch staff have in common.\nHealth care heroes agree that fighting Covid-19 requires a teamwork approach not only for the health of their patients but to support one another emotionally.\nBEST MATERNITY WARD\nStony Brook University Hospital Preserves Joy And Wonderment of Childbirth\nExpectant mothers arrive at Stony Brook University Hospital maternity ward surrounded by a caring and highly skilled staff of health care professionals who feel uniquely privileged to experience the miracle of childbirth with families.\nThe hospital has all private rooms and mothers and babies remain together as much as possible. Patients arriving at the hospital are tested for Covid-19. Covid-19 positive patients are cared for in negative pressure rooms in labor and delivery and staff closely monitor for signs and symptoms.\nShavon Bailey, RN. Photo Credit: Stony Brook University Hospital\nHowever, there were a few severe cases where the patients required a higher level of care in other areas of the hospital.\nRN Ashley Schuette works in antepartum, labor and delivery, newborn and postpartum at Stony Brook Hospital. She recently talked about the benefits of expectant moms being able to have the company of a support person to stay with them throughout their birth experience, along with a doula if they want, for labor and delivery.\nStony Brook did a great job because the moms were allowed to designate someone to come with them to the hospital and stay the entire time. We were great to be able to do that for our patients, said Schuette in a phone interview.\nOver the past year, some patients had Covid-19 but were asymptomatic and others were scared to get sick or have their babies get sick, she related.\nIts different than before because you never know who is sick so you want to be careful around everyone. In the beginning, we didnt know how it was affecting moms and babies and we could only go by what we were hearing from the CDC. It was scary for the patients. A new mom just wants to protect her baby and is nervous something will happen to their baby but they know we are doing our best.\nElena Lecrichia, RN sits with her husband and newborn daughter Taylor. Photo Credit: Stony Brook University Hospital\nTo assuage concerns among the expectant mothers she tries to educate them with information available from the CDC and hospital protocol to keep them safe.\nAccording to Schuette, apart from the safety measures and donning the PPE for deliveries new moms enjoy the same joyous experience at Stonybrook.\nShe feels privileged to do the kind of work she does. Its one of the most rewarding things. You get to be a part of such an instant moment in peoples lives. You are there the first time they get to hear their baby cry. Its incredible. Some [women] dont think they can get through [labor] and they do.\nShavon Bailey is also a nurse in antepartum, labor and delivery, newborn nurse, and postpartum. She talked about helping the mothers feel safe both before and during their stay at the hospital.\nSome are nervous about getting sick. We do our best from answering calls ahead of time and comfort them when they walk in the door.  We listen to their concerns and answer questions, letting them know we are doing our best. Were all good at comforting this way because this is our specialty.\nBailey was one of the nurses at the hospitals first Covid -19 C-section of a mom who was in the ICU, she related. The mom was well and the baby was well and didnt have Covid. We had great leaders that came up with the procedures and we practiced. It looked different with all the PPE and safety but it went very well.\nAshley Schuette, RN in personal protective equipment. Photo Credit: Stony Brook University Hospital\nLabor and delivery nurse Elena Lecrichia recently gained a better understanding of what it is like to deliver a baby in a pandemic. She gave birth at Stony Brook in May. My coworkers are capable of empathy and it gave me a personal edge to the experience, she recounted.\nShe was seven months pregnant when news of Covid-19 hit.\nIn the beginning, she said there was general fear among herself and co-workers when like the rest of the world news of Covid-19 and how contagious it was began coming.\nIt started off slow. There definitely was some fear. Wed hear about it a little bit then there were more and more patients coming in with Covid and you knew this is serious. This is contagious and no one wanted to bring that home to their family, she recounted.\nLecrichia back then being pregnant added some concern for her at work. We didnt know if it would transmit to the baby. The fear was the unknown. It was hard, Lecrichia said.\nBut she pushed through, and in fact, worked up until the day before her baby was born. Her coworkers were supportive. We always wore the PPE and I always felt safe.  And they took the assignments that were riskier, the patients with Covid.\nNurse Elena Lecrichias newborn daughter Taylor rests in her bassinet. Photo Credit: Stony Brook University Hospital\nShe agrees the best way to ease any concerns for pregnant women arriving to have their babies is through education and communication. We work hard to normalize the process.  Even though its during a pandemic and theres more PPE for you its still going to be a loving experience, said Lecrichia.\nThe new moms shes seen coming through the doors are resilient. They are amazing and can adapt to anything.  Im really impressed with our community of moms. Even though the world may look a little chaotic, its still a time to celebrate happy moments.\nBEST MEDICAL TRANSPORTATION COMPANY\nMedford Volunteer Ambulance Brings Pre-Hospital Care, Comfort To Patients In Pandemic\nMedford Volunteer Ambulance EMTs rely on teamwork and each other to answer the publics call in the crisis  bringing emergency care and comfort in pre-hospital transport  making sure each patient has the best chance for recovery.\nVolunteer EMT Justin Zimmerman credits a close-knit group among the volunteers who get each other through",

The data was released on bioRxiv, the preprint server, prior to publication.\nWhole genome amplification (WGA) is required for low-input DNA and single-cell analysis, and single-cell approaches are critical for tackling difficult biological questions involving genomic heterogeneity. Current WGA technologies and methods for single-cell or low-input DNA analysis, however, only cover a fraction of the genome, have a limited capacity to detect genetic variation in each cell, and suffer from significant biases, experimental artifacts, and poor reproducibility. The new data show that PTA can overcome these limitations as well as provide high-quality, scalable analysis of single-cell genomic heterogeneity. Having access to this analysis can enable new insights into human disease at the cellular level and empower high-resolution diagnostics for cancer, gene-editing, and other applications, BioSkryb stated in a company press release.\nFurthermore, the PTA technology accurately calls genomic variants within tissues, one cell at a time, and reproducibly captures more than 95% of the genomes of those cells in a more controlled and accurate manner than existing approaches. According to the data released, PTA can be reliably used to call copy number variation in primary cancer cells and genome-wide variant detection in gene-edited cells. The technology can enable the feasibility of performing single-cell evaluations of biopsies from cancer and gene-edited tissues.\nThe PTA technology has been made a part of BioSkrybs ResolveDNA kits, which contain all the enzymes and reagents needed for whole genome amplification from single cells or ultra-low DNA inputs. The kits employ a unique set of nucleotides to prevent recopying of the amplification products, which results in less errors and higher, more uniform coverage of the genome. The PTA technology also enables the attachment of cell barcodes to the resultant products for pooling and downstream analysis.\nWe developed PTA to accurately and efficiently decipher genetic diversity at the cellular level so that we can better detect, understand, and treat disease, said Charles Gawad, MD, PhD, inventor of the PTA technology, cofounder of BioSkryb, and associate professor at Stanford University, in the press release. These data show that PTA amplifies the genomes of single cells with high coverage breadth and uniformity in a reproducible manner to significantly improve variant calling of all types. The ability of PTA to enable highly accurate genetic information at single-cell resolution could uncover new drug targets for cancer and neurological diseases as well as identify CRISPR off-target activity to monitor the safety and fidelity of gene editing.\nChuck and I cofounded BioSkryb to ensure researchers had access to the most advanced DNA analysis technologies, so its especially exciting to see the superior performance of PTA over current methods and to be able to make it commercially available through our ResolveDNA kits, said Jay West, PhD, CEO, and cofounder of BioSkryb, in the press release. Existing whole genome amplification methods uncover a fraction of the genomic information, but now with ResolveDNA, researchers can explore new places in the genome and be confident in the quality of the sequencing data at those sites.\nSource:",

These are reviewed by a GP, and a private prescription is issued if appropriate, before being sent to an affiliated pharmacy.\nThe online clinic had been put in special measures in July 2019, after CQC experts found the process for completing patient identification checks was ineffective.\nFlaws in the providers system also allowed people requesting weight loss medicines to overwrite information such as their height, weight and body mass index.\nFollowing another inspection in February, chief inspector Dr Rosie Benneyworth warned insufficient improvements had been made and the CQC started taking action which could have led to closure.\nHowever, following the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, the CQC withdrew its proposal to cancel the registration and instead kept the website under review until it could carry out its latest inspection in October.\nThe inspectors latest report noted a whole raft of improvements, including improved identification checks, such as anti money-laundering checks and development of facial recognition technology.\nThe CQC also said patient records and contacts were always completed and recorded, and there were improved processes to deal with emergency medical situations.\nManaging director Paul Marshall said: I am very pleased indeed. This has been a long process and we are very pleased to be coming out of special measures and to be recognised as good.\nIm pleased the inspectors have recognised the amount of work that we have put in.\nHe added PrivateDoc had worked closely with the CQC to put things right after being pulled up over a small handful of cases.\nMr Marshall said the company had improved its systems with new software and quality improvement action systems.\nAlthough it received very few complaints, it had overhauled the system for dealing with these to ensure that all possible lessons were learned.\nLooking to the future, he said PrivateDoc would continue to improve. We are going to expand the scope of the service, and we are looking at introducing face-to-face consultations with doctors online.\nIf you value what this story gives you, please consider supporting the East Anglian Daily Times.

Last year, Atlantic Cape students were awarded over $590,000 in scholarship funds.\nFor Briseida Olivera Moreno, 20, of Pleasantville, a Baking and Pastry student in the Academy of Culinary Arts, receiving scholarships has been a tremendous help  especially due to the additional costs of the culinary program.\nWhen the scholarships came in it was a relief, Briseida said.\nIn addition to being an NJ STARS scholar, she has earned the Atlantic Cape Restaurant Gala, Major League, Costa Memorial, V. Lawrence Brice and Borgata scholarships.\nAfter she graduates, Briseida hopes to open a bake shop and make wedding cakes.\nKellett added that there are a variety of scholarships available, including a new one offering up to $1,000 for students taking drone classes the Cape May County campus.\nRequirements for our scholarships vary, so while some have a minimum GPA, others are based on financial need or county of residence. There is one for students who just love the beach! Kellett said.\nMegan, 29, of Egg Harbor Township is the recipient of four scholarships from the college: the OceanFirst Bank, Richard Benner, James Boyd and Shelby Leigh Griffith scholarships. She is currently the vice president of the Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society here, which has a project this year to encourage more students to apply for scholarships.\nIts so sad that theres thousands of dollars in scholarships each year that are not being utilized, said Megan. You have nothing to lose. You can only gain by applying for a scholarship.\nMegan said that most applications take about an hour and only require 250-word essays. She said not to be intimidated by the requirement for a professor to endorse you.\nAll of the professors are so willing. They want you to ask, she said.\nCurrently, Megan works as a logistics coordinator for a freight company, but she aspires to be an author. She is studying English, with 4.0 GPA, and has been accepted to Stockton University to complete her bachelors degree, but is also applying to Princeton University.\nAnd none of that would be possible without Atlantic Cape, Megan said.\nBriseida said she, too, was thankful to the Atlantic Cape, especially the staff and administrators, for their help in getting her connected with the right scholarship applications and classes.\nIt was important because I knew that it would be a hard to collect that much money for me to go to school, she said. All of those scholarships were going to be a lot of help for me, even one scholarship would be enough.\nReturning students can apply for scholarships through March 6. If chosen for a scholarship, it can be used for the upcoming Fall semester.\nNew students are automatically considered for scholarships after completing their Atlantic Cape application and FAFSA.\nFor more information on scholarships, visit atlantic.edu/scholarships\nBe the first to know\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\nSign up!\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy\nRelated to this story\nMost Popular",

These are reviewed by a GP, and a private prescription is issued if appropriate, before being sent to an affiliated pharmacy.\nThe online clinic had been put in special measures in July 2019, after CQC experts found the process for completing patient identification checks was ineffective.\nFlaws in the providers system also allowed people requesting weight loss medicines to overwrite information such as their height, weight and body mass index.\nFollowing another inspection in February, chief inspector Dr Rosie Benneyworth warned insufficient improvements had been made and the CQC started taking action which could have led to closure.\nHowever, following the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, the CQC withdrew its proposal to cancel the registration and instead kept the website under review until it could carry out its latest inspection in October.\nThe inspectors latest report noted a whole raft of improvements, including improved identification checks, such as anti money-laundering checks and development of facial recognition technology.\nThe CQC also said patient records and contacts were always completed and recorded, and there were improved processes to deal with emergency medical situations.\nManaging director Paul Marshall said: I am very pleased indeed. This has been a long process and we are very pleased to be coming out of special measures and to be recognised as good.\nIm pleased the inspectors have recognised the amount of work that we have put in.\nHe added PrivateDoc had worked closely with the CQC to put things right after being pulled up over a small handful of cases.\nMr Marshall said the company had improved its systems with new software and quality improvement action systems.\nAlthough it received very few complaints, it had overhauled the system for dealing with these to ensure that all possible lessons were learned.\nLooking to the future, he said PrivateDoc would continue to improve. We are going to expand the scope of the service, and we are looking at introducing face-to-face consultations with doctors online.\nIf you value what this story gives you, please consider supporting the East Anglian Daily Times.

        "utterance": "favorite_border\nNewswise Stress seems to have a negative effect on the learning of movements - at least in mice. This is the conclusion of a recent study at the University of Bonn. According to the study, the neurons of rodents lose some of their contacts with other neurons after stress. The animals also developed motor deficits. The results may be useful for earlier diagnosis and improved therapy of stress-related diseases such as depression. They also document that stress leaves traces in the brain - possibly permanent ones. The study appeared in the journalTranslational Psychiatry.\nChronically stressed people often show abnormalities in their motor skills, such as poorer fine motor control. However, how these symptoms occur has hardly been studied so far. \"We investigated this question in our study,\" explains Prof. Dr. Valentin Stein from the Institute of Physiology II at the University of Bonn.\nThe researchers used mice as experimental animals, some of which they exposed to a stressful situation for a few days. Meanwhile, they used a special microscopy method to take pictures of the rodents' brains. They focused on parts of the cerebral cortex responsible for motor control and learning new movements.\n\"With our method, it is possible to observe one and the same neuron at different points in time,\" says Dr. Anne-Kathrin Gellner, a physician at the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy at Bonn University Hospital. \"We can therefore see whether and how it changes as a result of stress.\"\nStressed mice lose synapses\nIn fact, the researchers came across a conspicuous feature: after the stressful situation, the neurons studied lost some of their synapses - these are the contacts to other nerve cells. During learning processes, new synapses are usually formed or existing ones are strengthened. Instead, the stressed rodents lost up to 15 percent of their contacts.\nAt the same time, the animals developed motor learning deficits. For example, they had to try to grasp a food pellet with one paw and transport it into their mouths. In the wild, mice use both paws to do this, so they had to relearn this skill. The non-stressed control group achieved a success rate of 30 percent after five days. The stressed rodents, however, only managed to take the food in every tenth attempt.\nMice vary in their sensitivity to stress. Some of them hardly develop any abnormalities after a few days of stress - they are considered resilient. Surprisingly, these robust animals had similar difficulties as their more sensitive peers in learning to grasp with one hand. \"It is therefore possible that motor tests are very suitable for detecting stress-related disorders such as depression before other symptoms become apparent,\" hopes Prof. Valentin Stein.\nEven resilient animals are not immune\nEven in resilient animals, moreover, the number of synapses decreased after the stress event. Unlike their stress-sensitive peers, however, the affected neurons recovered: after one and a half weeks, the number of synapses was again similar to that before the stress event and comparable to that in non-stressed control animals. \"Nevertheless, it may well be that psychological stress also leaves permanent traces on them if it is too long or too frequent,\" worries Stein, who is also a member of the Transdisciplinary Research Area (TRA) \"Life and Health.\"\nThe researchers also have clues as to what triggers the loss of synapses: Certain immune cells, the microglia, were activated in the rodents' brains. They belong to the so-called phagocytes and can, for example, digest pathogens or defective cells. It is possible that they are \"switched on\" by stress and then attack the contact sites.\nThe research group also examined the fluid that washes around the brain and spinal cord. They found certain proteins that can normally be detected there in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's or Alzheimer's. \"We therefore believe that stress-related psychiatric diseases such as depression are also associated with the degradation of neurons,\" says Dr. Gellner. \"Accordingly, long-term stress - to which children are increasingly exposed - can potentially cause serious damage to the brain.\"\nParticipating institutions and funding:\nThe Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy of the University Hospital Bonn, the Institute of Nutritional Research of the University of Potsdam, the Institute of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, the Institute of Molecular Psychiatry, and the Institute of Physiology II (all University of Bonn) were involved in the study. Dr. Anne-Kathrin Gellner was supported by the BONFOR program of the Faculty of Medicine.\nPublication: Anne-Kathrin Gellner, Aileen Sitter, Michal Rackiewicz, Marc Sylvester, Alexandra Philipsen, Andreas Zimmer and Valentin Stein: Stress vulnerability shapes disruption of motor cortical neuroplasticity.Translational Psychiatry,DOI: 10.1038/s41398-022-01855-8.",

I think it was a year in October that I first reached out, Fausey said. Over the course of this past year, weve built our standard out using our current training platform through Care Academy.\nThe program equates to 144 hours of class time and 2,000 hours of working time over a year, where individuals obtain paid work experience in home care, classroom instruction and an Advanced Home Health Aide certification. That certification can be used in any state.\nBy using the Care Academy training of Home Helpers, in conjunction with the national quality standard of the apprenticeship program and the location of local Home Helpers, a well-rounded experience for program participants is provided.\nFausey explained that amid the pandemic, Home Helpers moved into a building that once served as a home, which provides spaces to learn, in applicable settings, things like washing dishes or using a shower bench.\nThis home has opened up that world of opportunity, too. All that kind of came together, Fausey said.\nThe apprenticeship program also provides opportunities to younger individuals who may express interest in entering the home health care field. The program is open to anyone 16 years old and older.\nWe are at a point in our country where we need more caregivers, Fausey said. We need more hands-on folks working, and this program opens it up to even a young person, so they can come in. Theyll work alongside someone else until theyre 18, but it gives them the opportunity to see if this is the career path they may want to choose.\nShe paused and added the program may also help someone realize he or she doesnt want to work in home health care.\nWhy not know it when youre 17?

        "utterance": "Share\nThe external fund manager backed by Berkshire Hathaway's Charlie Munger, Li Lu, makes no bones about it when he says 'The biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. As with many other companies Besunyen Holdings Company Limited (\n) makes use of debt. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?\nWhen Is Debt A Problem?\nGenerally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together.\nView our latest analysis for Besunyen Holdings\nWhat Is Besunyen Holdings's Net Debt?\nThe image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that at December 2018 Besunyen Holdings had debt of CN150.0m, up from CN20.0m in one year. However, because it has a cash reserve of CN94.9m, its net debt is less, at about CN55.1m.\nMore\nA Look At Besunyen Holdings's Liabilities\nAccording to the last reported balance sheet, Besunyen Holdings had liabilities of CN301.2m due within 12 months, and liabilities of CN86.7m due beyond 12 months. On the other hand, it had cash of CN94.9m and CN66.1m worth of receivables due within a year. So it has liabilities totalling CN226.9m more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.\nThis deficit isn't so bad because Besunyen Holdings is worth CN568.3m, and thus could probably raise enough capital to shore up its balance sheet, if the need arose. However, it is still worthwhile taking a close look at its ability to pay off debt. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But you can't view debt in total isolation; since Besunyen Holdings will need earnings to service that debt. So if you're keen to discover more about its earnings, it might be worth checking out this graph of its long term earnings trend\nIn the last year Besunyen Holdings actually shrunk its revenue by 30%, to CN378m. To be frank that doesn't bode well.\nCaveat Emptor\nWhile Besunyen Holdings's falling revenue is about as heartwarming as a wet blanket, arguably its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) loss is even less appealing. Its EBIT loss was a whopping CN137m. Considering that alongside the liabilities mentioned above does not give us much confidence that company should be using so much debt. Quite frankly we think the balance sheet is far from match-fit, although it could be improved with time. Another cause for caution is that is bled CN121m in negative free cash flow over the last twelve months. So in short it's a really risky stock. For riskier companies like Besunyen Holdings I always like to keep an eye on the long term profit and revenue trends. Fortunately, you can click to see our interactive graph of its profit, revenue, and operating cashflow\nWhen all is said and done, sometimes its easier to focus on companies that don't even need debt.

        "utterance": ",\nJan. 27, 2022\n/PRNewswire/ -- The \"U.S. Healthcare Staffing Market Size, Share & Trends Analysis Report by Type (Travel Nurse Staffing, Locum Tenens Staffing, Allied Healthcare Staffing,\nPer Diem Nurse Staffing\n), and Segment Forecasts, 2021-2028\"report has been added to\nResearchAndMarkets.com's\nThe U.S. healthcare staffing market size is expected to reach\nUSD 31.1 billion\nby 2028. It is expected to expand at a CAGR of 3.71% from 2021 to 2028. The increasing geriatric population is leading to rising demand for medical services and a shortage of nurses and other medical staff. The cost-effectivity of temporary staffing is likely to drive the market in the coming years.\nThe geriatric population in the U.S. is gradually increasing. According to the National Institutes of Health, the number of people aged 65 years and above in the U.S. is projected to nearly double from 48 million to 88 million by 2050. This rising geriatric population is anticipated to increase the burden on the current medical workforce, creating a gap between the demand and supply of medical professionals.\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), around 500,000 nurses will retire over the next few years. Additionally, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges, there will be a shortage of around 21,000 to 55,200 primary care doctors by 2032. A shortage of physicians in the coming years is likely to drive the market. In addition, an increasing need for a home care workforce, such as dieticians, nutritionists, nurses, therapists, and home care aides, is expected to boost the market growth.\nTechnological advancements are driving healthcare employment. With the advent of various innovations, such as telehealth and medical informatics, the need for skilled labor to handle both technical and non-technical aspects of these devices has increased. Hence, recruitment of new professionals along with training of existing ones has become essential. The flexibility in work timings and attractive wages are primary reasons for increasing the number of nurses becoming per diem and travel nurses.\nFurthermore, the rising number of medical facilities and new construction projects are anticipated to create more jobs for medical professionals. For example, in\nApril 2021\n, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced\nUSD 1 Bn\nto support health centers' construction and renovation projects from the American Rescue Plan. The aforementioned factors are anticipated to propel market growth.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, demand for staffing services and workforce technology solutions increased dramatically. The increasing incidence of COVID-19 infection significantly fueled the demand for travel and per diem nurses. According to a poll conducted by Avant Healthcare Professionals, 90% of the medical facilities accepted using travel nurses for the management of COVID-19 patients in 2020, compared to less than 60% in 2019. On the other hand, the demand for locum tenens specialists and allied health professionals decreased due to the cancellation of elective surgeries.\nU.S. Healthcare Staffing Market Report Highlights\nThe travel nurse staffing type segment dominated the market in 2020. High demand for nurses during flu seasons, travel opportunities, and nurse shortage is expected to drive the segment. For instance, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), there will be a need for over 1.1 million new registered nurses by 2022\nThe locum tenens staffing type segment is anticipated to witness the highest growth over the forecast period owing to the cost-effectiveness of hiring temporary employees and an increase in the trend of physicians opting for becoming locum tenens\nAccording to Staff Care's 2020 Survey of Temporary, Physician Staffing Trends report estimates that around 85% of the U.S. medical groups, hospitals, and medical facilities used locum tenens in 2019\nMergers, collaborations, and acquisitions are the key strategies undertaken by the players to improve their market position.

The Chesterfield Board of Selectmen has issued a letter to United Natural Foodsdemanding the wholesale grocer develop on-site parking for tractor trailers delivering or picking up merchandise to its warehouse on Stow Drive.\nUnited Natural Foods, Inc. is directed to submit this revised parking site plan application to the Chesterfield Planning Board on or before April 4, 2022, states a letter to UNFI approved by the Board at its Wednesday meeting.\nThe warehouse site does not currently have parking for delivery trucks, states the letter.\nThe purpose of the site plan is to accommodate trucks that are now routinely and dangerously parking out on [Route 9], prior to being able to deliver or pick up the goods ... states the letter.\nThe site plan should also include suitable electric connection points to serve such trucks, states the letter.\nLast year, the town received a letter from the New Hampshire Department of Transportation, acknowledging a hazard to the safety of the traveling public.\nThe state advised the town to either require UNFI to construct sufficient overnight parking or widen Stow Drive, which is a town road, to provide parking for the trucks.\nThe Department of Transportation said Chesterfields plans to resolve the problem must be submitted by April 15.\nIf this work is not completed in the time prescribed, states the letter, the town shall be civilly liable to the state for any costs incurred to complete this work.\nThe letter from the state was in response to a letter sent by Duane Chickering, Chesterfields police chief.\nWe continue to move the trucks along, but within a seemingly short amount of time, more trucks take their place, wrote Chickering. If we do not address this issue, this will continue to get worse and worse. Each time increasing the propensity of a traffic collision in the area.\nThe police chief also requested the state install No Parking signs along Route 9 near its intersection with Stow Drive, as well as in an area on the north side of the road that is being used illegally for parking.\n[I]f this does not get addressed, something tragic is going to happen, wrote Chickering.\nDuring the boards Feb. 23 meeting, Chairman Gary Winn said the Town Administrator and Police Chief Duane Chickering have both been in contact with UNFI.\nSupport our journalism. Subscribe today. Duane [Chickering] has made ... three or four calls there since my conversation with them in December and has not heard anything, added Winn.\nMore than 400 people work at the Chesterfield facility, supporting more than 30 grocery retailers across the region.\nA spokesman for United Natural Foods said the company brought in significant new business in the fall of 2021, which led to a swift increase in traffic to the Chesterfield facility, especially as we ramped up inventory in August, September, and October.\nWe fully recognize that this increase in traffic created some challenges along Route 9, replied UNFI in an email. Since that time, weve worked to address those bottlenecks and create a more efficient traffic flow into our facility.\nSome of those measures include adding additional security guards to help guide the movement of trucks, increasing the number of parking spaces around the building, and adding two hours of additional receiving time to better spread out the inbound deliveries.\nUNFI also opened a distribution facility at 90 Technology Dr. in Brattleboro in November to relieve pressure at our Chesterfield distribution center.\nBy taking these measures, we feel weve addressed some of the initial issues experienced and well continue looking for ways to ensure UNFI can be a good community partner to Chesterfield, our immediate neighbors, and our associates who live and work here, stated the email.\nThe Brattleboro property is managed by Winstanley Enterprises in Concord, Mass. Most recently it was being used for cold storage by Country Kitchen, which was purchased by Flowers Foods in 2012. Flowers Foods closed the bakery in 2018.\nA spokeswoman for Winstanley said about 65,000 square feet of space was built out for UNFI over the past year, mostly for cold storage and office space. The building was originally built by Northeast Cooperatives, which was purchased by UNFI in 2003.\nUNFI, the largest distributor of organic, natural and specialty food and health and beauty products in the U.S. and Canada, got its start in California in 1976 as Mountain Peoples Warehouse, which grew to become the largest full line of natural foods distributor in the western United States. In 1996, it expanded its reach to the eastern United States when it merged with Cornucopia Natural Foods in Rhode Island.\nIn 1997, what was now named United Natural Foods acquired Stow Mills, which got its start in Brattleboro when Bob Swanson went on the road to collect goods for The Good Life, a local health food store, and Llama, Toucan and Crow, which would eventually become Stow Mills.\nBefore moving to Chesterfield, Stow Mills was located in Brattleboro from 1980 to 1988.\nIn 1997, UNFI, located in Dayville, Conn., purchased Stow Mills for $100 million in stock.\nUNFIs largest customer is Whole Foods, which was purchased by Amazon in 2017.\nBob Audette can be contacted at raudette@reformer.com",

        "utterance": "Roasting marshmallows around a firepit: Not necessarily the most conducive scenario for serious business discussions.\nOr so you might think.\nBut thats exactly what Salesforce has experienced with its customers when using the Glue Corporation virtual collaboration platform. Attendees of the software giants virtual expos and meetings have gathered in woodsy, wildflower-blooming environs to discuss customer relationship management (CRM) software, use cases, and strategy sometimes when relaxedly toasting the central ingredient for smores over a campfire.\nThis is one of the most popular places, Nick Botter, chief innovation officer and retail lead for northern Europe for Salesforce said during a recent demo of the virtual environment for VentureBeat. People love this, they can sit here in this beautiful natural environment, put their feet up, roast marshmallows and have quite a relaxed discussion.\nNot long before the onset of COVID-19, many companies including Salesforce were focused on cultivating engaging, in-person experiences at their various global locations and events.\nThe world changed, Salesforce adapted\nNow just the fact that we use the term in-person experiences indicates how much the world has changed in such a short time. To adapt, Salesforce which has commanded a global physical presence with its giant office towers and expos drawing attendees in the tens of thousands is leading the charge in its adoption of VR and AR tools.\nOver the last year, the CRM leader has implemented virtual collaborative tools developed by Finland company Glue Corporation These create true presence with spatial audio and customizable, 3D avatars that mimic the gestures and movements of their users while sharing media, notes and presentations both live and asynchronously.\nWhen COVID hit and remote work became the norm, it was very difficult to have a really good group discussion our brain is just not wired to look into a camera the whole time, said Botter. We had a vision to build these immersive environments.\nThe use of AR and VR has been growing exponentially in recent years, and that trend is only expected to continue: According to Technavio, the AR/VR market size will be $162.71 billion by 2025, representing a 46% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) since 2020. Furthermore, Superdata says that the enterprise sector will generate more than 70% of the overall AR/VR revenue by the end of 2022.\nGlue, which was founded in 2016 and is supported by $8 million in investments from Maki.vc, Reaktor Innovations, Tesi, Braigel Brothers, Foobar.vc and angels, is helping fuel this trend with its remote presence technology. Competing with the likes of The Wild, Party.Space, Yullo, Breakroom, and Facebook Horizons, the companys platform combines immersive 3-D graphics, VR and cloud computing technology to allow companies to maximize their collaboration potential, said CEO Jussi Havu.\nWhereas organizations used to spend more than $1.3 trillion a year on business travel, Now they are faced with the remote engagement pain points of Can you hear me now? and Oh sorry, you go firstok, I can go first, said Havu. Dispersed teams are burdened by Zoom fatigue.\nThe way we work has fundamentally changed, said Havu. Remote is the new norm. Our social interactions are becoming predominantly virtual. This is also impacting the way we work and do business.\nTesting the power of Glue\nLeveraging its teams broad background in advertising and movie production environments, CGI, graphics, video games and enterprise-level security platforms, Glue tested its first commercial pilots in 2019.\nThe company today counts among its customers Deutsche Telekom, Axel Springer, and Salesforce the latter choosing its platform, Botter said, because of its capabilities with spatial audio, which mimics real multi-dimensional sound.\nAs Havu explained, Glue offers about a dozen different templates, but users can create custom platforms, as well. Salesforce, for its part, has digitally replicated its San Francisco tower and Dreamforce expo. It is also in the process of building an environment that provides a more dynamic, customer-tailored demo space. For example, it could mimic a manufacturing plant with assembly lines, or an oil platform with working rigs.\nThese platforms provide venues for larger creative workshops and smaller roundtables, and are used in a mix of in-person meetings and collaborations via Zoom, Google Hangouts and Slack for groups of roughly five to 40 people.\nWeve been able to gather all these people, create moments for smaller groups, bigger groups, one-on-one interactions, Botter said. They really have the feeling that they are connected with each other, but without the travel.\nIn the Dreamforce expo platform, for instance, customers start out in Dreamforce Park, then traverse along a stone walkway through groves of pine trees and patches of wildflowers surrounded with fluttering butterflies.\nBotter explained of the backdrop: The idea is that we came out of the pandemic into new beginnings, sprouting new flowers.\nAlong the way, user pass billboards with automatically uploaded, industry-relevant customer stories, watch videos, converse in mindfulness corners, and request more information by tapping big red buttons. They can virtually high-five each other, and avatars gesture along with their movements (either as they gesticulate or shift their gaze to a groups dominant speaker).\nMeanwhile, the Salesforce tower platform features a seating area in a pavilion with floor-to-ceiling windows offering sweeping views of San Francisco Bay. Users can even pour themselves virtual cups of coffee before gathering in a presentation area, settling into casual clusters of tables and chairs, or gazing out the windows at iconic city landmarks including Alcatraz and the Golden Gate bridge. Botter himself, who was once based in the Golden City but now works out of Amsterdam, noted that he sometimes uses the platform for scenic purposes: I miss San Fran, sometimes I go and look at the city that I miss.\nKeeping the virtual environment real\nSalesforce relied heavily on its real estate and marketing departments in designing the spaces, and the physical limitations (or lack thereof) took some getting used to. For instance, the ceiling could be raised in the Salesforce tower without concerns for heightened earthquake impact.\nYou can really play with the environments, Botter said.\nHowever, he stressed: When we started doing this, we didnt want to build a gimmick. We thought it should be fun, but that it should also be useful and bring value to us and our customers.\nTo that end, users can draw on Whiteboards and take advantage of tools including screen shares, giant post-it notes and freehand 3-D drawings. These materials can all remain in the platform for as long as users need them or be exported via web user interface to various supported file formats. The platform will also eventually include automatic note-taking capabilities,",

        "utterance": "In this June 6, 2017, file photo, a reporter holds up an example of the amount of fentanyl that can be deadly after a news conference about deaths from fentanyl exposure, at DEA Headquarters in Arlington, Va.\nCredit: Jacquelyn Martin / AP\nRare drugs designed to mimic the opioid fentanyl are showing up more often in urine samples from Penobscot County than any other county in the nation, according to a recent study. The findings are concerning to the authors, they said, since they come at a time when the fentanyl analogs are frequently being added to methamphetamine, creating a deadly combination.\nIn the study published in the Drug and Alcohol Dependence journal, the authors analyzed 300,000 urine drug tests from July 15, 2019, through March 12, 2020. Health professionals from all 50 states submitted urine samples to Millennium Health LLC, a commercial laboratory based in San Diego, to have them tested as part of patients routine care. The vast majority  295,647  had not been prescribed fentanyl for medical purposes.\nThe studys authors, who are all employees of Millennium Health, found that, of those patients testing positive for fentanyl without a fentanyl prescription, 40.55 percent had at least one fentanyl analog detected in their system, showing that copycat fentanyl is absolutely infiltrating the market for illicit substances, said Joseph Stanton, associate director of clinical affairs at Millennium Health and one of the studys authors.\nFentanyl analogs are usually produced in clandestine laboratories and, while they are chemically similar to fentanyl, they were specifically engineered to skirt U.S. law though the U.S. later banned them China is the principal source of fentanyl analogs, which has routed the drugs through the mail and Mexico, according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.\nSome drug dealers mix fentanyl analogs with other drugs, such as heroin, cocaine and methamphetamine. Mixing is cheaper for dealers because it takes only a small amount of a fentanyl analog to produce a high. However, its far riskier for users who dont always know what they are getting, evidenced by the fact that, in Maine, the average drug overdose death in 2019 involved three drugs Different analogs have different potencies, and they are not all well understood or well studied.\nOne well-known analog, however, is carfentanil, which, at 100 times the potency of fentanyl, was originally designed to sedate large animals such as elephants and moose. About 20 microgramsof carfentanil, which is less than a grain of salt, is enough to kill someone.\nOf the no-prescription, fentanyl-positive urine samples in the study, the counties that saw the highest positivity rates for more frequently found analogs such as carfentanil and acetyl fentanyl were in Kentucky and Ohio.\nBut the greatest percentage of urine samples showing traces of the least frequently found fentanyl analogs came from residents living in Penobscot County. Of those Penobscot County samples, 11.36 percent tested positive for at least one of seven rare analogs, such as acryl fentanyl.\nFor Dr. Noah Nesin, chief medical officer for Penobscot Community Health Care in Bangor, the data was startling. To have Penobscot County at the top of the list is distressing and a possible explanation as to why our overdose rates remain higher than the rest of the state, he said. PCHC does not send samples to Millennium Health.\nIn its other studies, Millennium Health can see methamphetamine use has been growing quickly in Maine  placing the state 10th nationally for its methamphetamine positivity rate among urine samples processed by Millennium Health. Maine has the fifth highest positivity rate in the nation for fentanyl, based on the laboratorys data. And for the number of samples showing a combination of methamphetamine and fentanyl, Maine ranks sixth, said Eric Dawson, the laboratorys vice president of clinical affairs.\nCombined with the recent evidence showing a high prevalence of rare fentanyl analogs in Penobscot County, it paints a very concerning picture of the state of Maine and that county specifically as it relates to those users, said Eric Dawson, vice president of clinical affairs at Millennium Health and a study author. As you start adding these things, you add to the risk of overdose.\nNeither Dawson nor Stanton know why the rare analogs appeared in Penobscot County in the eight months prior to the pandemic.\nNeither did Marcella Sorg, director of the Rural Drug and Alcohol Research Program within the University of Maine. But the results were not a surprise to her.\nI suppose thats unusual, but Maine has had fentanyl analogs present in the population since late 2012, she said.\nIn 2017, acryl fentanyl was involved in the drug death of one person in Maine, according to  Sorgs analysisof drug-related deaths that year. Butyryl fentanyl, another lesser-found analog, helped kill two people. Cyclopropyl fentanyl killed eight. And furanyl fentanyl, which the Millennium Health study didnt detect in its review, contributed to the deaths of 32 people in Maine that year. Maine has seen a variety of fentanyl analogs show up in the overdose data since.\nDifferent analogs seem to peak at different times. Its tough to get a real sense of why that may be, Stanton, with Millennium Health, said. But the authors hope that knowing more about the ever-changing makeup of the drugs in an area will help local providers and others have more informed conversations with people who are using drugs and enhance efforts to reduce overdoses, they said.\nSorg also questioned whether the studys sample size was large enough to protect against Penobscot County rising to the top of the list by chance. It is reasonable to assume that if the lesser-known analogs are in Penobscot County, they are also elsewhere in Maine, she said. Or, its possible Millennium Health tested Penobscot County samples at a particularly troublesome time.\nThey may have just happened to hit it when a bad batch showed up in the drug supply, she said.\nDr. Mark Publicker, an addiction specialist based in Portland who uses Millennium Health, agreed that the analogs may be common throughout the state. As for Penobscot Countys ranking, that may be a function of how many providers use Millennium, which may be greater than other areas in the state, he said.\nThe study does not reveal how many samples per county Millennium Health received. Because it is a private company, it doesnt disclose specific data about its customer base, Dawson said. But the company only analyzed counties where at least 10 samples tested positive for fentanyl, and 181 counties across 30 states met that bar. The lab detected the rarer group of fentanyl analogs in 56 counties across 16 states.\nOur data is limited to samples being sent to our lab from health care practitioners. It may not reflect the general population of users, but what we see for Maine is concerning, Dawson said.\nWhat is clear to Sorg from the study is that fentanyl an",

They founded Joshs Place,\na company that provided group home accommodations and other services to adults across Minnesota,\nwhich ended up being acquired by REM Minnesota in early 2020.\nThe pair then came up with the concept behind\nJoshin\n, a digital care platform that aims to connect care providers to families with specialized care needs. (Both companies were named after the sisters brother, who was named Josh). And today, that startup is announcing it has closed on a $3 million seed round of funding co-led by Anthemis Group and The Autism Impact Fund.\nJoshin started out as an app that creates a care plan that helps it match families to a carefully vetted trained caregiver. It has evolved to also include a corporate benefits program that involves Joshin partnering with companies who want to offer an inclusive care benefit to their employees.\nImage Credits: Joshin\nAn estimated one in five families have complex health needs, ranging from children with neurodivergence to dependent adults with developmental and physical disabilities. The COVID-19 pandemic has only highlighted the need for support, making it even more difficult to find necessary care. As such, many people (most of which are women) are finding they have to leave jobs to become full-time caregivers.\nFor too long, people with special health needs and their families have been underserved and had fragmented access to disability care providers, said CEO Danielsen.\nAs ADA turns 30, tech is just getting started helping people with disabilities\nCOO Fountaine says that\nhistorically the care economy has focused on children under 12, or adults over 65 childcare and eldercare, respectively.\nJoshin really is positioned to be the leader in that huge age gap thats out there, she said. We work with people at all stages of life, and I think its unfortunate that until now, thats been missing from the conversation.\nThe company plans to use its new capital in part to grow its network of care providers. It also aims to expand its corporate benefits program.\nWere continuing to scale our technology to lessen the burden of caregiving responsibilities for employees and their families, added Danielsen.\nOver the past 12 months, Joshins community of members and caregivers has grown 200%. With the new funding, the startup plans to expand its services to Los Angeles and Seattle. It is currently operational in its home base of Minneapolis, Minn., Chicago and New York City.\nJoshin will be soft launching in 8 new markets over the next few weeks and hopes to be national very soon, Fountaine said.\nThe startup is starting\nwith employers, and building up the data that it derives from that effort. Over the next year, it intends to partner with managed Medicaid organizations, and with both private and public insurance companies so that it can get families access to this care, quickly, said Danielsen.\nOur goal is to make this to make quality care free for families who need it, she told TechCrunch.\nChris Male, co-founder of the Autism Impact Fund, said his organization backs companies that are addressing unmet needs of the autism community. Finding, retaining, and coordinating care are three of the biggest hurdles that individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and their families face, according to Male.\nJoshin has a proven ability to provide a reliable means to source caregivers with diverse skill sets and potential to serve as a platform for streamlining access to a variety of critical yet highly fragmented services for the special needs community, he said. Given the current insurance payer landscape and employer emphasis on DEI, Joshin is not only generating strong impact for a large disability market, but is a monetizable opportunity as both a reimbursable service and as a benefit to employees.\nBy partnering with employers, Male added, Joshin will help provide an environment of support that will allow employees to quickly and easily access key resources and thus minimize downtime. Matthew Jones, managing director at Anthemis, said his firm doubled down on its investment in the startup because it saw in its founders one of the strongest examples of founder-market fit out there. (Anthemis also led the companys $1.6 million funding round in July of 2020).\nThe progress that they have made since our last investment coupled with the insights that they have collected led us to believe that doubling down in this round was a no-brainer, he told TechCrunch.\nAlso, the complexity that comes with building technology in the space makes the barriers to entry very high, Jones added.\nThe teams grit, combined with their understanding of the problems and opportunities associated with disability-related care, set Joshin apart, he wrote via email. No other platform comes close in terms of having such specialized leaders at the helm, so its no surprise that corporates are lining up to add Joshin to their roster of employee benefits.",

(TSX-V: NGE; OTCQB:NVDEF, NGE) and Astro Resources NL (ASX: ARO, Astro) are pleased to announce that they have signed a Letter of Intent (LOI) to leverage NGEs extensive exploration database to generate and advance epithermal gold projects in a million-acre area of interest in northern Nevada (the AOI).\nUnder the LOI, NGE will contribute its exploration data within the AOI and grant Astro a first right to use this data to acquire current and future exploration targets for two years, based upon a standard earn-in agreement. In exchange Astro will commit to spending US$1.4M on the resulting projects (the Strategic Alliance).\nAdvertisement 3\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\nArticle content\nAstro Chairman, Jacob Khouri, commented, Being based in Australia, where our industry has had no choice but to advance new undercover exploration tools to explore in the 80% of the country where the bedrock is covered, our team recognises the incredible opportunities globally for first movers applying new technology to open up covered search spaces. Were very pleased to partner with Nevada Exploration, a recognised leader in undercover exploration, to employ the same strategies being used in Australia to participate in exploring for what we believe to be one the biggest prizes in our industry, the second, undercover, half of Nevadas gold endowment. With a 15-year head start, NGE has used the latest exploration technology to build a database of new exploration targets under cover, which we can now use to develop a meaningful portfolio of new projects. We have begun our review of NGEs database and expect to make further announcements soon.\nStrategic Alliance\nWhile Nevada is often touted as a global leader in terms of gold production per area, the reality is that the 4.6 million ounces Nevada produced in 2020 is only half of what the state produced in 1998.\nLike in other mature districts, continued exploration of Nevadas now well-explored exposed settings is generating fewer discoveries despite record exploration expenditures. The future of mining globally is tied to the transition to undercover exploration, which in Nevada, means exploring in the more than 50% of the state where the prospective bedrock is hidden beneath its valley basins.\nAdvertisement 4\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\nArticle content\nNevadas exposed terrains have historically produced more than 200 million ounces of gold, and experts agree, there is likely another 200 million ounces waiting to be discovered beneath Nevadas valleys. To unlock this globally significant residual gold endowment, NGE is the first company to bring the latest undercover exploration technologies to Nevada. Most significantly, NGE has spent more than 15 years integrating new hydrogeochemistry (groundwater chemistry) and low-cost drilling technology to build an industry-leading, geochemistry-focused toolkit to explore for new undercover gold deposits.\nA photo accompanying this announcement is available at\nhttps://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/b7f90dca-7c23-44df-a0a3-020023ed4ac9\nNGE has used its technology to complete the worlds largest groundwater sampling program for gold exploration, which also represents the largest regional-scale geochemistry-based generative exploration program in Nevada since the successful stream-sediment sampling programs in the 1980s.\nNGEs generative program involved aggregating more than 50,000 historic water sampling records, then collecting more than 6,000 new groundwater samples, predominantly from purpose-drilled boreholes, each of which was analysed directly for gold and related pathfinders using the latest laboratory technology.\nA photo accompanying this announcement is available at",

Tony Evers appointee after his term expired May 1.\nThe 300-wolf quota was decided by an illegal vote taken by an improper body, both influenced and ultimately decided by a person who was no longer a member of that body, based on political considerations that disregarded facts, science, and the expertise of agency biologists, and under the umbrella of an unconstitutional law, the complaint states.\nA DNR spokesperson declined to comment on the litigation. Prehn did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe groups are asking the court to block the DNR from issuing any permits for the fall hunt and to invalidate the 2011 law requiring the hunt, which they say violates the separation of powers and the public trust doctrine enshrined in the state constitution.\nEmails: DNR board chair consulted with GOP about staying\nThis is the second time this year the DNR has faced legal action over wolf hunting.\nLast winter a Jefferson County judge ordered the DNR to hold a hunt in the final days of February, later than any previous state-sanctioned seasons.\nHunter Nation Inc., a Kansas-based organization run by the former head of Americans For Prosperity, sued the DNR after the agency said there was not time to develop a science-based quota in consultation with tribal governments.\nReport: Guided by politics, wolf hunt harmed packs, did little to resolve conflicts\nThe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service removed gray wolves from the endangered species list on Jan. 4, returning management authority to the lower 48 states and tribes.

At Sunrise, 16 private patient rooms include similar amenities, along with areas for conversation and reflection. Patients at each facility will receive care 24/7 from an interdisciplinary team of physicians, nurses, social workers, chaplains, volunteers and bereavement experts.\nWe are honored to partner with the Broward Health system to offer comprehensive, compassionate care to their patients and families, said Betty Bel, VITAS vice president of operations. The benefit is two-fold in that patients with advanced illness have greater support to align with their goals of care, and hospital staff can rely on our specialized teams to provide a smooth transition to the nearby in-hospital inpatient unit.\nAdvertisement\nThe two facilities continued expansion in Florida for Miami-headquartered VITAS. The company last year openedan inpatient unit at the AdventHealth Lake Wales Hospital campus and unveiledanother at the Community Health and Rehabilitation Center, also in Florida.

The Sunset location includes an outdoor area, activities for children and specialized therapies. These include Paw Pals pet therapy visits and care specific to the unique needs of veterans approaching the end of life such as bedside salutes and Honor Flight virtual reality experiences.\nVITAS has served patients in the Broward county area since 1980. The company operates 49 hospice programs across 14 states and in the District of Columbia, with 28 inpatient hospice units nationwide.

Why is that notable?\nAnkur Rungta: I think there are three points to make here. Firstly, while the stores arent technically opening concurrently, with Dorchester opening in March of 2022 and Roslindale and Roxbury to follow in the summer of 2022, they were approved concurrently. We see the significance in a few different ways.\nFirst off, Boston has been a very challenging place to get local approvals generally for cannabis. Locals are protective over their space and want to make sure theyre comfortable with whos coming in. It speaks to the community process that Brian and Jaison Chavez, our partners at High Profile x Budega, ran and the trust the community has in them.\nAnother interesting point is Boston was the first major city on the East Coast to legalize recreational cannabis. Even with New Jersey and New York coming online soon, Boston will always remain one of the most sizable, influential markets on this side of the country, so these three licenses are an extremely valuable opportunity to build a brand in a major metropolitan area.\nLastly, I would also say that we're not aware of any other social equity licensees that have gotten a series of licenses for three storefronts (the maximum permitted in Massachusetts) versus only one. Im proud of the work these guys have done to achieve that.\nJB: For people who don't live in legal states or who aren't in MA, can you speak to the difficulties of becoming licensed in the state? How is it harder for equity applicants?\nAR: In Massachusetts, specifically, it's a very long and difficult process. First, you have to get local approval for a site as well as a significant amount of community support. There is a zoning process with the city which can take one to two years or sometimes longer. During this time youre spending a lot of time and money with a lot of uncertainty because you're holding real estate. The significant financial component can become incredibly challenging and is a huge barrier to entry, especially for social equity applicants who do not have access to capital.\nBrian Chavez: Part of my and Jaisons story is that two of the properties were our uncle's properties, which allowed us to avoid some of the heavy real estate holding costs that are typically involved. We also ran the community process ourselves which resulted in a cost standpoint and accessibility, and was much easier than hiring consultants or lawyers.\nAR: Part of the rationale for partnering with us is that our team could bring some other resources to the table, in terms of both finances and expertise. You have to actually come back and build the store out, a complex process which requires designs and permitting, while at the same time holding real estate where youre initially spending money without making it. Its a long, kind of torturous process. Our partnership with the Chavez brothers has allowed us to be successful in that both parties bring assets to the table that the other might not have been able to.\nJB: Could you walk me through the current landscape of social equity, who got licenses and how, in Massachusetts?\nAR: I think generally, there's a very low level of minority and social equity ownership in the Massachusetts cannabis industry. And that's not unique to Boston, but I think Boston is actually at the forefront of changing these patterns by implementing a system that does result in more social equity ownership.\nIn Boston right now its one to one, meaning for every one social equity license, the city must issue one non-social equity license. So now you have a number of stores in Boston that are approved and on their way to opening that are social equity-owned, and we applaud the city for not only promoting social equity, but making strides in execution and bringing it to fruition.\nJB: What is something exciting or notable about the Massachusetts market that people outside of it might not know? How does C3 fit into that?\nAR: In general, there seems to be less emphasis on premium flower, and premium, top-shelf products as a whole, in Massachusetts, and the gap in that market excites us. We see a huge opportunity for our focus on high-end flower, a chance to offer the consumer something more curated and differentiated from a product quality standpoint. Of course there are retailers in Boston who carry some amazing brands and products, but were excited to work with Brian and Jaison who share the same obsession with quality and want to target that corner of the market.\nWere aiming to go the boutique route, offering our customers a curated selection of the highest- quality products on the market.\nJB: Personally, I hope bodega/corner store culture is the future of weed. What are your thoughts on that and why?\nAR: Totally. We view these three stores as very much the neighborhood stores where we're serving the community in the spirit of the local bodega, making cannabis conveniently accessible. If you live in Dorchester currently, you have to go to another part of Boston or even outside of the city to get cannabis. So this is all very much about the neighborhood and community and Brian and Jaison are very much deep in these communities.\nBC: This is not a random part of Boston - were actually from Dorchester. Dorchester is the location that we worked out with C3, but the other two are my uncle's bodegas - he has long been ingrained in these communities. These are long standing local stores where neighbors would go to buy groceries, milk, cigarettes, anything you need. Wed like to look at it as were just continuing what these stores and locations have already done for these communities, but in a new way, and providing convenient and safe access to high-quality cannabis.\nJB: Do you have anything else to add? Free space! What did I miss?\nBC: I want to not only build success for my family and for myself but also to pay it forward. I feel very blessed and fortunate to have accomplished all that I have and Im excited for the next phase of actually opening these three stores. Im already thinking about how I can pay it forward and how I can encourage other social equity entrepreneurs to be successful in this space.\nFollow me on",

        "utterance": ",\n2nd August 2019\nWant to lead a healthier life, raise funds for charities you love, and fit it into your busy lifestyle?\nThen join a groundbreaking new national challenge, One Million Steps.\nRecently a shortlisted finalist for The Great British Entrepreneurs Social Good Award Wales, One Million Steps hopes to raise millions of pounds for Welsh charities of all sizes.\nParticipants walk an average of 10,000 steps a day for 100 days  one million steps or 500 miles. Research shows the average Briton walks only 3000 to 4000 steps a day with one poll showing, for many, it could be as low as 2000 steps.\nThe innovative mass challenge is the first Welsh startup to win a place at Google Launchpad London, winning awards from UnLtd, the School for Social Entrepreneurs, the Fairwood Trust, and invited to\nNatwest Accelerator\nCardiff-based\nFounder, Ranjit Ghoshal, came up with the idea when he injured his knee training for a charity challenge.  Coming from the non-profit sector, he realised the need for a platform based on social innovation principles and health campaigns that ensured that the product was accessible, acceptable, affordable, and, critically for participants and donors, accountable.\nRanjit said:\nWe know the benefits of an active life. 58% of Welsh adults are now overweight or obese, according to the Welsh Health Survey, and 7% of Welsh adults are being treated for diabetes. We are also increasingly aware of how stress affects mental health. Walking has been shown to be extremely effective for both physical and mental well-being.\nMy mission was a mass challenge event that businesses and charities of all sizes could promote to staff and supporters, costs less than travelling and taking part in a big event like a marathon and allows charities to scale their fundraising efforts easily.\nInstead of having to sign up for an overseas trek or race, and take the time out to train and complete, you fit your million steps into your existing lifestyle.\nYou can choose to walk up mountains, race around the local park, dance the tango, or take aerobics classes. Do it solo, with friends, or team up with work buddies but importantly, it had to be automated so participants could focus on their challenge rather than constantly updating progress.\nEveryone gets a Million Steps pedometer and app which records steps, distance, and, importantly, active minutes.\nIntegrated fundraising pages show a participants challenge progress  this provides accountability so friends, family, and colleagues can cheer participants on and donate to their chosen charity.\nHow it helps Welsh businesses and staff\nBusinesses are being asked to get behind the Million Steps challenge to help staff get fitter while fundraising for charities and social good.\nA recent study by XpertHR found that employees take an average of 2.8% of their working days off sick. Encouraging staff to take part in employee health and wellness schemes has obvious benefits to the business. However it can be tricky. So, giving them an extra reason to take part (helping a charity) often gives them the nudge they need to get active and helps businesses fulfill their corporate social responsibilities.\nRanjit said:\nMany business owners want healthier staff. Encouraging staff to support a charity and walk a Million Steps provides greater motivation and can help businesses to help local community projects.\nCompany branded landing pages, integrated with a charity the business supports, mean staff have just one place to visit, sign up, and set up fundraising profiles. With content on mindfulness practice, yoga an important everyday exercises, the benefits could be huge for staff well-being.\nHow it helps Welsh charities\nThe challenge is an ideal tool for charities to scale their fundraising activities both locally and nationally.\nRanjit said:\nSmaller charities struggle to organise local events and often the passion is not translated into a return on investment from limited resources.  Big overseas events are great but fundraising levels are high and the cost of golden tickets in major athletic events are often beyond the reach of many charities.  These factors helped us model the Million Steps challenge to ensure as many barriers were overcome and health and fundraising was the big goal.\nParticipants may be doing the challenge locally but can compete with friends anywhere in the country encouraging a viral sign up as friends and colleagues team up.\nIt will also encourage people who worry about their fitness levels to get involved, get fitter, make a social good difference and then take on much tougher challenges.\nThe Million Steps platform streamlines event management by providing integrated fundraising pages, Gift Aid collection, charity landing pages and participant sign-up, and the ability to embed explainers or videos in customisable pages with easy-to-use templates.\nSHARE",

Total Brain attributes this growth to a complete rebuild of its\nearlier in 2021.\nTotal Brain Logo (PRNewsfoto/MyBrainSolutions)\n\"Our long-term investment in upgrading Total Brain's technology to provide our clients with a more robust set of actionable data and tools is resonating,\" said\nMatthew Mund\n, CEO, Total Brain. \"We listened to behavioral health professionals nationwide. The tremendous response from the industry to our new and improved clinical platform speaks volumes. We are excited by the traction gained so far and we look to continued success in the clinical care support market.\"\nThe new and improved Total Brain clinical platform includes a clinically-validated assessment, mobile app-based self-care tools, and a clinician dashboard. Clinicians incorporating Total Brain into their practice treat various conditions including substance use disorder, behavioral health disorders, traumatic brain injuries, mild cognitive impairment and more.

        "utterance": "NewsDesk\nFashion 4 Development has taken a minority stake in Citizen-T, a pandemic company specializing in reused artistic t-shirts.\nLaunched as a global platform in 2011 by Evie Evangelou, Fashion 4 Development was created to support the United Nations Millennium Development Goals and the United Nations Every Woman Every Child initiative led by the former Secretary General Ban Ki Moon. F4D develops partnerships that promote the fashion and textile industry, while advancing economic and social development, preserving culture and empowering women.\nWhile F4Ds focus is largely on social awareness and service, as the organization expands to product offering, Evangelou is keen to use what she has learned to help other businesses.\nWith Citizen-Ts fashion-art combination, different messages will be placed on t-shirts to help a variety of charities. F4D also increases the power of upcycling to reduce the amount of clothing and textiles that end up in landfills. Citizen-T is going to be the collection of F4D, she said.\nWe have great visibility around the world, so Id like to start teaching other companies that are doing similar things that could be used to amplify the message, Evangelou added.\nOne of those messages appears on a Code Red t-shirt made in collaboration with Burnett New York and due to be featured at New York Fashion Week next month. Its meant to be a reminder, Evangelou, of the recently released UN climate change report.\nWe need to use these tools to reach people of all cultures and all nations. At this point we are in a code red and we need to do as much as possible [to address the issue of climate change], she said.\nAlso part of F4Ds new Ts, Steven Tylers Janie Fund recently teamed up with Citizen-T and visual artist Brian Fox to create a limited-edition t-shirt that the Aerosmith musician signed on to. Proceeds will go to Janies Fund to help support young women who have suffered abuse and neglect with 24 hour therapeutic care. Aerosmiths 1989 song Janies Got a Gun tells the story of a girl who was abused by her father. The musician would have often wondered what type of care would have saved her from such trauma. In 2015, he created the fund in partnership with the Villages de Jeunes to try to help the victims. The collaborative t-shirt, launched earlier this week, will help provide 1,000 days of care for women aged 17 to 22.\nCitizen-T was launched about 15 months ago by artist Stephanie Dillon and almost all of its products are somehow reused, adding sustainability to the social impact of the program. Janies Fund shirts, for example, were created from recycled T-shirts.\nAs a kid of the 70s Dillon said going to concerts was an important thing to her and of course the way to market this event was to get a t-shirt. During the pandemic, she reassessed her clothing consumption as well as what was happening with the planet in relation to climate change. Trying to figure out how to sell his work with art shows canceled in the middle of closing, Dillon decided to flip his boxes and boxes of vintage graphic concert Ts, put his art on them, and sell them as Ts. recycled art shirts.\nWhen Dillon isnt using up his stash of gig products, Citizen-T sources from recycling resources like Goodfair in Texas and Wearable Collections in New York. These recycling entities are doing their part to offset the estimated 1.2 billion tonnes of CO2 that textile production creates each year more than international flights and shipping combined according to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation.\nAs an artist, Dillon is represented by the online jury platform Singulart where some of her current offerings include a $ 9,000 acrylic on canvas. Her art is an iteration of recycled t-shirts, in that she tries to use only damaged t-shirts and frames, she said, adding that sometimes she starts with art that is already there and built from it. Such reuse is also inspired by his personal purchases. Dillon reused tissue paper from Louis Vuitton handbags or Chanel purchases for his art. I was trying to be conscientious even while consuming this. I mean, there are some things a girl just cant live without, she said.\nNow that F4D has taken a stake in Citizen-T, the concept of using less waste, encouraging upcycling with a touch of art, and through celebrity networking has won over both sides. Through international connections, Evangelou and Dillon (who met through Olympian Dotsie Bausch, who is deeply involved in the food business part of F4Ds global campaign Sustainable living is the new fashion ) hope to give Citizen-T a more global dimension to activate more environmental awareness, the couple said in a joint interview on Tuesday. The goal is to get more people to start buying recycled, recycled and unmanufactured merchandise and potentially even showcasing those reused designs in a fashion show.\nBeyond spreading sustainability to more consumers, Evangelou said she was also open to adding other like-minded companies under the F4D umbrella to amplify the messages shared.\nSources",

It opens the door for the center to have a broader network of cancer care physicians nationwide, access to technology and national purchasing power.\nIts a strategic move for the organization that supports our continued philosophy of focusing 100% on cancer,\" said Todd Stevens, CEO of Mary Bird Perkins Cancer Center in a news release.\nThe decision left the Our Lady of the Lake Cancer Center leadership \"stunned\" and \"disheartened\".\n\"We were reassured by Mary Bird Perkins that their preference was to continue our relationship for the radiation and management services they provide,\" according to the statement. \"We are very disheartened to see our good work together in cancer care, built over the past decade, being dismantled for out-of-state interests. Weve all watched these outside groups enter into communities and make decisions strictly for their out-of-state profit and investors.\"\nAs for whether Mary Bird Perkins Cancer Center in Baton Rouge would continue in the same building, Our Lady of Lake referred The Advocate to Mary Bird.\n\"As our team currently performs miracles in this COVID-19 surge, we are even more disappointed by Mary Bird Perkins decision and dismayed by the swift nature of this out-of-state transaction,\" the statement said.\nOur Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center had formed a partnership with Mary Bird Perkins in the early 1990s and was previously known as Mary Bird Perkins - Our Lady of the Lake Cancer Center. Woman's Hospital has been working with the cancer center since 2017 for breast and gynecologic cancer treatment which now features a pavilion on Woman's Hospital's campus.\nTop stories in Baton Rouge in your inbox\nTwice daily we'll send you the day's biggest headlines.

        "utterance": "Save\nFor years, the company ArchVirtual has been bringing architecture into the realm of virtual reality. Now, its trying to do the same for job training, and training medical professionals in particular.\nArchVirtual recently launched a software platform called Acadicus a virtual reality tool that medical training facilities can use to teach and simulate procedures for aspiring nurses, emergency response technicians and clinicians. Two weeks after the projects launch, company co-founder Jon Brouchoud said hes already working with the UW Health Clinical Simulation Program to implement the technology there.\nWith Acadicus, you can put on a headset, and be immersed with a medical expert, Brochoud said. Youre not a static observer, a passive observer of a video. Youre engaged in the learning. Youre able to pick up instruments and follow along.\nBrouchoud said that the software could be applied to environmental job training in industries from construction to automotive repair. However, the company is primarily targeting medical training facilities for Acadicus' launch.\nSchools that buy Acadicus get a library of virtual reality training simulations. A student pops on a virtual reality headset, picks a course, and find themselves in an operating room, an examination room, an ambulance, or any one of the softwares other pre-built environments. They would be able to see the avatars of other students participating in the course, as well as that of an instructor and have access to an inventory of tools, from scalpels to valve masks, as well as interactive assets like human dummies to practice procedures on.\nFrom there, theyd be able to follow along the instructor as they walk through a medical procedure. Currently, Brouchoud said the technology is well-suited for teaching broad-stroke lessons things like establishing a sterile field on a patient, or walking through the fundamentals of emergency response. In later iterations of the software, he hopes to enable more sophisticated lessons, such as complex surgical techniques.\nBut the real innovation that sets Acadicus apart, said Brouchoud, is the ability for instructors to record themselves giving demonstrations in Acadicus.\nAn instructor literally walks in, hits record, and Acadicus records everything theyre saying, everything theyre doing, said Brouchoud. They can save that training into the library...and someone else can come in and see face-to-face this instructor talking.\nBrouchoud said this is an innovation in hands-on health care education. Up until this point, facilities have been investing in sim-labs brick-and-mortar recreations of health care environments with high-tech equipment and mannequins or acquire off-the-shelf or commissioned VR simulations that lack specificity or customizability.\nA product like Acadicus, said Brouchoud, means that a facility wouldnt have to invest millions in expensive sim-lab equipment, or commission a VR developer every time they want to make a new course in virtual reality.\nWeve realized that, if we really wanna make a difference in the industry, the time and cost and complexity has to come down, he said.\nAlthough Brouchoud and ArchVirtual have made job training software before, the new focus on Acadicus represents a pivot: Up until recently, Brouchouds and ArchVirtuals specialty had been in bringing architecture to life in VR. The company would render 3D models of basketball arenas, condos, or even Madison office buildings for either project managers or members of the public to experience firsthand.\nBrouchoud decision to focus on medical training came about after the death of his father in 2017. He said that during his dads hospitalization, he learned about the shortage of nurses and medical professionals across the country and moreover, the shortage of trainers that can lead to skills deficits among those in the health care industry.\nLearning about that skills deficit profoundly shook him, he said. He even considered leaving ArchVirtual to go to medical school himself. However, he ultimately decided to use his existing skillset in VR development to help fix the problem.\nHe also decided to name the software after the Latin name of the Saw Whet owl, the bird that his father had spent his career studying.\nBrouchoud launched the software at a medical simulation conference in San Antonio in January. He said it was met with strongly positive feedback, and that he is already working with a number of early partners on implementing the technology.\nTheres a couple of people nibbling around this from an academic perspective, said Brouchoud. I would say theres no other tool like it on the market.",

Three companies are providing the government with the tests that are being sent to American households, and one of those companies manufactures its tests in China.\nWHAT WE FOUND\nThe U.S. Army allocated $2 billionto help procure some of the 500 million tests promised by Biden. That money went to three companies.\nTwo contracts worth about $300 million apiece were awarded to two companies: Rocheand Abbott\nRoche is a Swiss-owned company that partners with SD Biosensorto manufacture its rapid tests.

And a shortage of tests and the understandable demand from people across this country to get tests and make them free and accessible required us purchasing some of those tests from China in order to meet that demand.\nAll of the tests purchased by the government went through the same authorization process.\nThe FDA gave emergency use authorization to iHealthto make COVID tests likewise to Roche and Abbott. An EUA is the same thing the FDA gave Pfizer and Moderna for COVID vaccines.\nThe EUA outlines specific protocols for tracking how safe and effective the tests are, which iHealth and the other companies are required to follow.\nMore from VERIFY:\nYes, the free N95 masks from the federal government are manufactured in the US\nThe VERIFYteam works to separate fact from fiction so that you can understand what is true and false.

        "utterance": "attaches dispensers\nfilled with CR-7 to the bees as they exit the hives. My initial article, An Early Stage Commercial Ag-Tech Disruptor; Bee Vectoring Technologies describes how the BVT system works and the company's initial commercialization steps. This article will provide an update on the investment thesis and focuses on the recent developments that will significantly impact BVT's revenue stream. The company is just entering its third growing season but has taken giant steps to scale by:\nwidening the applicability of its product\nincreasing products offered\nTerritorial expansion and adding new crops\nInvestment thesis\nThere are many companies involved in bees for agricultural purposes. Looking at the websites for companies like Beeflow, BiobestBioBee, Koppert, and Aggrovio,you may think that these companies are competitors for Bee Vectoring Technologies. Remarkably, BVT partners or collaborates with all of these companies and just about every company involved in bee agriculture because no one else offers a regulatory approved, organic crop protector and fertilizer. Farmers have utilized bees for pollinating crops such as blueberries and strawberries for 9,000 years BVT is using these same bees to fertilize and provide disease and bug protection for crops.\nDespite the great strides that BVT has made in penetrating its targeted market, the stock price hasn't changed much since my original article in September last year. Growth stocks have been under pressuredue to rising interest rates. My investment thesis remains intact as the company remains on track with its commercial rollout. I expect the stock price to gain traction as the company becomes better known from the expected partnerships with the world's largest agricultural companies and continued revenue growth as the company enters its third growing season. Key potential drivers include:\nwidening the applicability of its product\nincreasing products offered\nexpanding its territory and adding new crops\nWidening the applicability of its product\nBVT recently announcedthat after a year of testing, the application of CR-7 on soybean crops results in significant crop yield increase and reduction of disease. These results open up opportunities for BVT to collaborate with the agricultural industry giants in soybean farming. Consider that there are about 200,000 acres of blueberriesand nearly 400,000 acres of strawberries while there are 320,000,000 acres of soybeansin the world to put this development into perspective.\nThe press release stated that eight companies are already involved in testing programs with CR-7, with one company conducting its independent testing. In addition, BVT is seeking to license the technology, which would bring in high margin revenue.\nBVT announced a memorandum of understandingwith BioSafe Systems where both companies will explore ways to collaborate using each other's products. BioSafe is predominantly involved with ground and seed spraying. Formal agreements with BioSafe will expose BVT to a brand new market opportunity with a U.S. $9 billion TAM.\nIncreasing products offered\nVectorite is designed so that different products can be stacked and delivered to crops by bees along with CR-7. In addition, the company has been conducting pilot testing with four companies since 2020 to add third-party solutions to its offerings menu. The first of these companies to reach an agreement with BVT, Biogard, has grantedthe company exclusive rights to sell their biological fungicide in Europe.\nCR-7 is pending and two years away from registration in Europe. The Biogard agreement allows BVT entry into the E.U. market through sales of an already registered product. BVT is continuing to work with the three remaining companies with the interest of developing additional crop products to be bundled for bee delivery.\nTerritorial Expansion\nThe territorial expansion has three different components:\nU.S. expansion\nEntering new territories through partnerships\nEntering new territories through registration\nU.S. expansion\nBVT received EPA regulatory approvalfor its technology in September 2019. In 2020 BVT began commercial activity serving blueberry and strawberry farmers in Georgia and Florida Florida's strawberry farmers could not compete with imported strawberries, and many filed for bankruptcy.Farmers tend to start with a small percentage of their farm acreage to compare the use of BVT with their everyday operations. BVT has retained 100% of its original blueberry farmers in Georgia who have now generally added their entire acreage to BVT, while BVT has been adding new customers in the same territory.\nEvery U.S. state recognizes EPA registration except California, which requires its own registration process. Testing is required in each state because growing conditions vary. Completing each territory's registration requirements and testing process is another layer on BVT's moat for potential competitors to surmount. In 2021, BVT began serving blueberry farms in Michiganand New Jerseyand blueberry and caneberry farmsin Washington and Oregon.BVT gained California regulatory approvalfor its technology in December 2020, obtaining access to the majority of farm acreage in the U.S. Within months of California registration, BVT initiated testingfor blueberries, strawberries, caneberries, and almonds. Revenue from the new states and new crops should begin in 2023. The company also has ongoing testsfor cranberries in New Jersey, Massachusetts, Washington, and Wisconsin and testing sunflowers in Minnesota, North Dakota, and Idaho.\nEntering new territories through partnerships\nBVT has established local partners in Morocco, Turkey, South Africa, and Israel. These partners will foot the bill for registration in their respective countries in exchange for exclusive or preferential rights to BVT's technology within their respective territories. Only the Morocco partner has begun testing while the other partners are still in evaluation mode. Agriculture is the top industryof Morocco due to a long growing season.\nEntering new territories through registration\nBVT is pursuing registration in Switzerland, Mexico, Canada, the European Union, and Peru. The Swiss process should be completed in 2022 at the latest. In addition, BVT has been in discussion with two go-to-marketcompanies to pursue Swiss revenue this year and has established operations in Switzerlandwith an R&D center, office space, and land leased to a local farmer for demonstrations.\nRegistration in Mexico, Canada, and the E.U. is expected to be completed by 2024 should the company raise sufficient capital to cover the costs. BVT has begun conducting testing in Mexico and is entering the E.U. market through partnerships.\nFinancial and expectations\nThere are about 117,000 shares. The company reported $1.7 million in cash and $782K in debt as of Dec. 31, 2021. The market cap is about $29K. BVT reported about $300K revenues for fiscal 2021, growing at about 80% over the prior year. P/S ratio is about 65X. Valuation ratios tend to be",

This is one of the governments attempts to get people off the elevator and escalator (unless absolutely necessary) and take the stairs as part of their commutes.\nOne of the people who champions these kinds of efforts is Deenanath Harapanahalli, founder of Cykul, a city-based sports and fitness organisation for the everyday Hyderabadi. The organisation recently launched StepUp - Stair Climbing Challenge. The joint physical-digital (phy-di) league between HYSEA (Hyderabad Software Engineers Association) and various government agencies encourages people to take charge of their routine with the help of data. Who says you cannot be fit both offline and online?\nDeenanath is excited about the fact that there are 10,000-plus people per week participating in this challenge, available through the Life Cykul app. Our aim is to do a million steps! Maybe well get to a billion at some point too, laughs the sports lover, explaining that there was a business strategy in StepUp as well. The market needed something like this; our cycling programmes had been going well but its a limited market and we wanted to expand into other sports.\nMost of Cykuls demographic is the corporate sector, people who find themselves deskbound and in need of a push-up or two to feel healthy and fit. Cykul understood that they needed something which people could commit to on their own time. So we started introducing a whole category of what we call as workplace leagues or workplace sports, and these are the activities that people can enjoy interactively. These are not your typical sporty sports but with newer technologies it is possible to initiate challenges like this.\nScreenshot of the StepUp  Stair Climbing Challenge from the Life Cykul app \nThe StepUp challenge relies on scan cards installed on each floor of a building which participants need to scan before scaling the stairs, and once they stop at the last floor of their journey, they simply scan their cards. Unlike a smartwatch or smartphone, this reads more accurately, claims Deenanath, because wearables register steps and stair counts incorrectly.\nThat said, gamified data is a big part of Cykuls USP. We capture the data of their walking and then every day there is, in real-time, a leader board that says, you know, who is walking, how long and the whole metric system gives implication of rewards and all that. And, of course, the StepUp challenge is a little incentivised with virtual certificates in the app. Cykul has been approached by supermarket and dining vendors to partner up and even get some coupons going once people reach a certain milestone.\nPicking up interest\nWhat does it take to bring a challenge like this to reality? Deenanath recalls the research stage which helped Cykul narrow their focus. In high-density corporate office areas, techies often crowded around elevators, regardless of whether the elevator went in the wrong direction first! So we observed that there was huge potential for energy savings; lifts account for 8 to 12% of a buildings electricity costs. Elevators also take, on average, 15 to 30 minutes of waiting time out of an employees day  both inside and outside the elevator itself. We also observed that everyone can use a little extra exercise whatever their routine.\nCykul even spoke with the Telangana states electricity department, talking about the lakhs that could be saved if people preferred taking the stairs where possible. The potential for StepUp to be scaled to residential areas is also high, agrees Deenanath. He is particularly looking forward to the impact of the summer season during which elevator-use will be much higher across the city.\nYou have reached your limit for free articles this month.\nRegister to The Hindu for free and get unlimited access for 30 days.",

But so too has been the embarrassment and uber-casualness that has intruded upon the supposed formality of meetings  and the security risks have also been laid bare.\nNo Pants Problems\nBroward Circuit Chief Judge Jack Tuter, for instance,  issued a message for all those lawyers in virtual court:\nWe can see you and whatever else is going on in front of your web cam. What he said about inappropriate scenes hes seen in court hearings held via video conference is one of the leading quotes from the week in South Florida business and legal news.\nOne attorney appeared on the livestream wearing a business suit without any pants  a faux pas he inadvertently gave away by crossing his legs.\nZoom Security Issues Exposed\nBut on-air issues aside, there are some key questions that need to be asked by lawyers using Zoom.  Despite the popularity and general ease of use of Zoom, the security issues presently make Zoom a problem from both an ethical and security standpoint for lawyers and law firms.\nAmong the key issues:\nLack of end-to-end encryption is an issue that is quite common for video conferencing services, but something that needs to be taken into account. End-to-end encryption is a system of communication where the only people who can read the messages are the people communicating.\nEnsuring that Zoom accounts, email addresses, social media accounts, host keys and other key data is not hijacked or found on the dark web.\nZoombombing, or hackers joining Zoom meetings and disrupting them by posting offensive content and cases where hackers have takencontrol of webcam and microphone access during Zoom meetings.\nPersonal accounts (including Zoom accounts) and corporate accounts being found on forums used by criminals.\nZoom had been sending data of registered and non-registered users to third parties such as Facebook, where options were offered on the Zoom site to log in via those platforms.\nSurreptitious access to LinkedIn profile data of both registered and non-registered users had been allowed.\nRisks of malware being installed on computers remains an issue.\nZoom meeting organizers having the ability to monitor whether participants are paying attention on calls\nMany users have been woefully unaware of who has access to their personal information and the extent of data collected by Zoom.  A number of major companies and governments have now banned Zoom use due to the privacy and security concerns, and the company is facing class action lawsuits arising from these issues.\nIn response to the security concerns and backlash over security concerns, Zoom Chief Executive Eric Yuan said that Zoom has fallen short of the communitys  and our own  privacy and security expectations. Zoom also claims to have corrected security flaws recently identified by security research. Still, they have conceded that they should have done something to enforce password and making room and double-check[ing] every Zoomers settings\nZoom appears not to have been designed for secure business use. The CEO himself has\nacknowledged\nthat Zoom has prioritized usability over security, but that that would be changing in light of the concerns recently highlighted over the companys security issues.\nThe privacy problems that have arisen with Zoom serve as an important reminder to lawyers that all digital tools need to be checked to make sure that the security concerns are addressed and that confidentiality and privacy obligations are adhered to.\nKey Advice For Lawyers Using Zoom\nSome tips for protecting privacy and security while using Zoom include:\nDo not forget that a Zoom account is like any other online account. Dont abandon standard protective measures when signing up for accounts, such as using strong passwords and two-factor authentication.\nRegistered users get a personal meeting ID for scheduled Zoom meetings. Avoid making this ID public, asanyone who has it will likely be able to join a meeting.\nHosts of calls should enable Waiting Room (which should be a default setting now), allowing the host to approve each person who tries to join a call.\nProtect videoconferencing calls with passwords.\nOnly download Zoom (and other video conferencing apps) directly from the companys website, or, for mobile devices, from Apples App Store or Google Play. The number of fake video conferencing apps has rapidly increased recently, and with that comes the increased risk of malicious software infecting computers and networks. ",

But its technology and integration is also helping wellness apps such as Shyft scale up.\nWritten by\n| New Delhi |\nUpdated: March 25, 2022 9:13:58 am\nShyft has integrated Zoom into its platform to offer live classes to consumers looking for wellness solutions such as Yoga, meditation, etc. (Image credit: Shruti Dhapola/Indian Express)\nThe coronaviruspandemic made Zoom one of the popular and most used video collaborative tools in the world. But its technology and integration is also helping wellness apps such as Shyft scale up and reach new consumers. According to Anand Bala, SMB Lead for India and SAARC at Zoom Video Communications, there has been increased adoption of collaboration platforms such as theirs across the wellness industry.\nOne reason is definitely because of the ability to scale and reach out to more customers, patients. Plus the ease of use that a platform like Zoom provides ensures they can get their integration done much faster. Our software development kit (SDK) is key, and it makes it easy for companies to integrate with their application, Bala told indianexpress.comover a video call.\nIn fact, Shyft (formerly Mindhouse) started as an offline wellness platform, just before the pandemic. But just three months in and the pandemic struck. For the wellness brand, which focuses on providing yoga, nutrition and meditation lessons via live Zoom classes on its app, the pandemic meant a 360-degree pivot in approach.\nhttps://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png\nAnand Bala, SMB Lead for India and SAARC at Zoom Video Communications\nWhat helped them thrive in the last two years: going online and integrating with Zoom. We had to move online. We wanted the experience for our offline users to be super smooth. The reason we chose Zoom was the ease of use. We werent also sure how long this is going to last, but its been two years now, Pooja Khanna, co-founder at Shyft, told indianexpress.com.\nThe way Zoom views it, they can help players like Shyft scale up fast since they are built for video. The video and audio quality is phenomenal. Our partners like Shyft can in turn focus on their strengths, in this case, being wellness, Bala said, stressing that the ease of use component is critical for their business customers.\nPooja Khanna, co-founder for the Shyft platform.\nAccording to Khanna, there is an overall indication that consumer behaviour has shifted drastically in the past two years. Users want to rely on online platforms for their daily wellness as it is more convenient.\nRead more\nWith Covid onset, retail consumer use saw unanticipated surge on Zoom: Iravati Damle\nWe actually saw a slight dip towards the end of 2020 when things opened up for the first time. But in 2021, we only saw an increase. People started to adjust to online platforms being more accessible and more convenient to them. And that is a true indication of that consumer behaviour, she said, adding that the new model also means there is no travel time involved for users in getting to the wellness studio, which is a break from the pre-pandemic times.\nWhat the Shyft app looks like.\nThe company claims to be doing about 200 live sessions every day combined between yoga and nutrition, and each class has anywhere between 10 to 35 people, which it expects to double soon.\nSwitching to Zoom and online also meant access to a new pool of talent for the wellness platform, with instructors now spread all across the country, something that was limited in the offline model. We have 70 instructors right now. They are in you know, tier-2 and tier-3 towns. And it has given us access to a really large pool of people. With offline, that is actually one challenge we used to face for talent since you could only hire people who are in that city, said Khanna.\nFor Zoom, the idea is to ensure that such integrations with other platforms remain a very seamless experience and the platform doesnt have to worry about the video experience. Were very carefully listening to customers and building our developer integrations around these feedbacks, Bala said. The way we handle data packets and the way we are engineered to do that is I think they will be a very, low data packet loss, Bala pointed out.\nBut what happens once the pandemic ends? Zoom knows that theres been a cultural shift and they are confident of continuing to scale up in 2022. In their view, the future will be hybrid and many workplaces, including companies such as Shyft, will continue to rely on collaborative tools such as theirs to stay connected with employees.\nYou will find that hybrid a given now that employees are going to be spread all over. Collaboration tools such as ours also provide a way through which you can connect with a wider range of customers too, Bala pointed out.\nSubscribe Now: Get Express Premium to access our in-depth reporting, explainers and opinions\nFor all the latest Technology News download\nThe Indian Express website has been rated GREEN for its credibility and trustworthiness by Newsguard, a global service that rates news sources for their journalistic standards.\nIE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd\nTags:",

Soteroff said in a prepared statement on Wednesday. We currently have more than 1,000 agents across the Caribbean regions of Aruba, Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Puerto Rico, and Turks & Caicos.\nVeteran broker Maayke de Haan will lead KWWs operations on the island. De Haan moved from Belgium to Sint Maarten in 1991 and began her real estate career in 1998. Ten years later, de Haan founded Antilles Realty, which has become one of the top boutique brokerages for buyers, sellers and investors searching for property and land throughout the Caribbean.\nMaayke de Haan\nAntilles Realty will be co-rebranded as KW Sint Maarten, and de Haans four-agent team will continue to operate out of their Cayhill office.\nWe joined Keller Williams for its systems and models that have proven to work all over the world. We share a love for real estate and a culture of caring, said de Haan in a written statement. Truly a win-win situation, we look forward to leveling up with KW and growing to be the No. 1 real estate company of choice in Sint Maarten.\nAdded Soteroff, As always, we seek to find the best leaders to guide our brand experience with every expansion into a new country and region, and de Haan symbolizes that high standard we have set.\nDespite travel and immigration restrictions, Keller Williams international operations grew steadily throughout 2021 with the franchisor launching master franchises in Slovenia, Thailand, Uruguay, Aruba, the Dominican Republic, Peru, Suriname, Paraguay, Serbia, Honduras, Turks and Caicos and Brazil.\nAs of their latest earnings report in November\n, Keller Williams Worldwide outpaced Keller Williams North American operations. While agents in Canada and the U.S. saw their annual transaction volume (-0.8 percent), new listings (-1.8 percent) and new contracts (-3.5 percent) slip, agents in KWW regions experienced their best year yet with transactions and sales volume increasing 36.3 percent and 74.5 percent year over year, respectively.\nSoteroff said KWW is primed to outdo their 2021 performance, as its international agent count increased 23 percent year over year in December alone. That momentum will be used to launch new franchises in Africa, Central and South America, Central and Eastern Europe and Asia in the coming year.\nNo one predicted the challenges of 2021, yet our international operations are thriving and were growing at a faster clip than ever, he said. And, thats due to a steadfast commitment to our values and principles and to providing the industrys best agent training.\nThe massive real estate franchisor now has 287 market centers across 50 regions representing nearly 15,000 agents.",

We need to know if were talking $50,000, $100,000  what are we talking about?\nHill said she appreciates that Big didnt put a price on the options because sometimes we get stuck on the cost versus looking at whats best for our community. They can take this week and review the options and lets discuss it at the (Tuesday) meeting.\nHill said Thursday that Big has not responded yet to the request for cost estimates.\nCouncil President Paige Bibbee said she isnt sure Big should be allowed to continue leading the branding effort, and shes definitely not willing to continue without detailed cost estimates for the companys work.\nIm not going to vote going forward without a price tag, Bibbee said Wednesday.\nBibbee said shes also not sure what is taking Big so long to move forward with its plans.\nAfter a citywide outcry against the proposal, the City Council rejected Bigs initial branding effort, A little Different, in August, but decided to allow the company to take another shot at coming up with new branding for the city.\nCFO John Andrzejewski said Tuesday the city has paid Big $107,197.53 so far with no outstanding bills.\nA Sept. 12 email from Big Senior Account Executive Logan Shoaf to City Clerk Stacy Gilley provides these options for the city:\n Option 1: Send out a questionnaire to the list of 600 emails gathered during the One Decatur Comprehensive Plan formulation. This would seek input on people's perception of the city, in addition to demographic data (age, district, etc.) and duration of residency in the city.\n Option 2 (recommended): Big would coordinate live community events in the citys five districts.\nThis process would feel much like a branding discovery session, where we ask open-ended questions that evoke differing opinions. Depending on the group size, this can be done in an Oprah-style event where the moderator calls out individuals for their opinions, or we can designate table discussion leaders who report to the broader group, Shoaf writes.\nThe invitation list would consist of both specific individuals we want feedback from (community and business leaders) and an open invitation to the public, the email continues.\nThe meetings could be held in concurrent weeks or all on the same night.\n Option 3: In addition to Option 1 but in place of Option 2, Big would create a questionnaire for the public events. A City Council designee would lead the One Decatur-like sessions instead of a Big representative.\n Option 4: In addition to Option 1, Big would coordinate one live community event but specific citizens from all five council districts would be invited.\nWe would need to closely manage attendance at this event due to the propensity to grow into a large and highly opinionated scenario, Shoaf writes.\nHill said she also prefers the combination of the first two options.\nIts more like the One Decatur style because it engages the residents, Hill said.\nCouncilman Billy Jackson, who was not at the work session, remains adamant the council is making a mistake in using Big instead of sticking with The McComm Group, which did the citys most recent marketing campaign.\nJackson said Thursday he finds it ironic that the council insisted recently on using a local company for the citys insurance while selecting Big over the Decatur-based McComm for the branding.\nThe only difference is one is insurance and the other is marketing, Jackson said.\nJackson said the city will sell itself if its roads are paved, its rights of way are taken care of and its clean.",

Biovachas also entered into an agreement with Pfizerin July 2021 with the goal to manufacture up to 100 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19vaccine for use exclusively in Africa.\nBiovac aims to expand its vaccine manufacturing capacity in Africa initially through its current activities related to the production of Pfizer-BioNTech's COVID-19vaccine and subsequently for much needed routine vaccines as well. This will bolster the global response to COVID-19and advance long-term health security throughout the African continent. This expansion is aligned with the UN Sustainable Development (SDG) Goal 3 on Good Health and Well-being by improving access to safe, effective, quality and affordable essential medicines and vaccines; and UN SDGs 8 and 9 on improving economic opportunities and upgrading technological capabilities of the pharmaceutical manufacturing sector in Africa. To realize the expansion and increased local vaccine manufacturing capacity on the African continent, Biovacwill need to raise around $150 million (ZAR2.3 billion).\nThe consortium partners will aim to support Biovacin this future manufacturing plant capacity and vaccine pipeline expansion. The consortium partners include the African Development Bank(AfDB), CDC Group  UK's development finance institution which is soon to be renamed British International Investment, the German development finance institution DEG, the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC), European Investment Bank(EIB), the European Union Delegation to South Africa, International Finance Corporation (IFC), the Industrial Development Corporation of South Africa (IDC), and the French development finance institution Proparco.\n\"COVID-19 has proven that a more geographical spread of vaccine manufacturing is much needed globally, with the African continent having the least number of vaccine manufacturers. We are pleased that the consortium of funders is willing to work with Biovacto create sustainable African vaccine manufacturing, not only to respond to the current pandemic, but also to much needed routine vaccines and future pandemic vaccines as well,\" said Biovac CFO Craig Mitchell.\n\"We have developed a 2030 Pharmaceutical Action Plan/Continental Vision for Africa. We aim to increase the local production of pharmaceuticals to 70% by 2030, and of vaccines to 60% by 2040. Today's announcement with Biovacis a strong testament to our pledge to make direct investments in manufacturers and provide leadership to support the development of the pharmaceutical industry on our continent. Africa must become self-sufficient. Health security is fundamental to economic security,\" said African Development BankGroup President Dr. Akinwumi A. Adesina, adding the COVID-19pandemic was a wake-up call that Africa could not outsource the health of its people to other continents or rely on global supply chains.\n\"Accelerating vaccine delivery to countries that need them the most must become a global priority, and this requires collective effort. CDC is thrilled to be a part of this consortium that brings together DFI expertise and capital to support Biovacin contributing to scaling vaccine production across Africa, and bolster the continent's response and self-reliance on this and other health crises,\" said Tenbite Ermias, the CDC Group's Managing Director for Africa.\n\"It is essential to join forces to address medical care in Africa. This is why we welcome Biovac's initiative to expand its vaccine manufacturing capacity in Africa. Besides strengthening vaccine production on site, it has a positive signaling effect for South Africa as a medical hub. We are happy to support the development of this project and look forward to strengthening the cooperation,\" said Roland Siller, CEO of DEG.\n\"The United States is proud to collaborate on this effort to expand manufacturing capacity for COVID-19and other critical vaccines in Africa in order to improve healthcare on the continent,\" said DFC CEO Scott Nathan. \"Supporting the global community's continued response to the COVID-19pandemic and strengthening health systems in developing countries are top priorities for DFC. This project advances President Biden's Build Back Better World (B3W) Initiative by bolstering global health infrastructure.\"\n\"Scaling up vaccine production in South Africa is crucial to accelerating global immunization and beating COVID-19. EIB Global is working with African and international partners in supporting vaccine manufacturing, improving public health and enhancing economic resilience to the pandemic across Africa. As part of Team Europe, the EIB is pleased to join financial partners to support Biovac's plans to produce vaccines in South Africa for Africa,\" said Ambroise Fayolle, European Investment BankVice President responsible for development.\n\"Our differentiated approach to find the best way to assist partner countries fight the COVID-19pandemic has made possible EU funding to help unlock significant Development Finance Institution loans in support of South Africa's own vaccine manufacturing capacity. The EU grant is an expression of Team Europe's unwavering commitment to the global fight to overcome the Covid-19 pandemic,\" said Dr Riina Kionka, the EU's Ambassador to South Africa.\n\"The IDC has a long-standing partnership with Biovac. From the onset, the Corporation appreciated the company's long-term objectives to establish a world-class commercial vaccine production facility. Recent development in vaccines access has reinforced the need to scale up and ensure capacity to manufacture vaccines locally, for our country and our continent,\" said Hilton Lazarus, IDC's Head of its Chemicals, Medical and Industrial Mineral Products Business Unit.\n\"This uniq",

A range of global funds, entrepreneurs and family offices joined the European Investment Fund (EIF) as the cornerstone investor.\nInovo wants to light up Poland. Photo credit: MICHA SADOWSKI\nInovo specialises in identifying disruptive tech startups and supporting their development and growth through participation in early-stage, post-traction seed and Series A funding. Having a diverse range of LPs in the fund will enable portfolio companies to secure global funding as they scale and expand abroad. The new fund has already committed funding to several investment opportunities with leading international investors, including European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), Andreessen Horowitz, Hoxton Ventures and Point Nine Capital. Notable investments include: Spacelift, Infermedica, Jutro Medical, AI Clearing, Zowie, Preply, Packhelp, Intiaro, Tidio, Allset and Eyerim.\nThis fundraise follows the success of Inovo I which generated 3.2x return on investments from a portfolio of 15 high-growth tech startups, most of which have since been sold profitably, two have IPOd, and three top-performing remain in the portfolio. One of the remaining investments is Booksy, the marketplace for beauty services where Inovo invested at the Seed stage. Now the company is one of the worlds top 100 marketplaces with 10 million app downloads and raised $70m in a Series C round (led by CatRock). Booksy is widely considered to become one of the first unicorn startups (those that have a valuation of $1b) from Poland.\nTomasz Swieboda, Managing Partner at Inovo\ncommented: The tech ecosystem in the CEE region is growing at an exceptional pace. In Poland the growth rate is 70% year-on-year. In 2020, almost 500m in venture capital was deployed to 300 companies, which will almost certainly grow this year. It is our expectation that this decade will produce 10 unicorns and a few decacorns from Poland.\nStory continues\nWith the launch of its second fund, Inovo is aiming to cement its reputation as one of the leading early stage investors in Poland and the CEE region, while helping enterprising startups realize their potential, paving the way for later-stage funding from international VCs.\nWith 38 million people, Poland is a large market itself. Last year we've seen IPOs of two tech companies valued at over $1bn and focused on the domestic market - Allegro and InPost. Market size is both an advantage and an obstacle, resulting in Polish ecosystem being not very well connected to the West. At Inovo we strive to change that. We are perfectly placed to act as a catalyst to accommodate the new wave of ambitious local founders who want to follow in the footsteps of Booksy, Brainly and Docplanner and target global markets. Through our collaborative approach and international network we can help bridge them to larger investors  added\nTomasz Swieboda\n.\nStefan Batory, Cofounder & CEO at Booksy\ncommented: The growth of the Polish startup ecosystem will accelerate after seeing success stories, proving that its possible to build global businesses out of the CEE region. I am certain that Booksy will serve as one such example, and then many will follow in our footsteps. However, for this to happen, startups need access to VCs like Inovo, which will provide not only capital, but also guidance and international connections for businesses to scale rapidly.\nAbout Inovo\nInovo is a venture capital fund investing in rapidly growing tech companies at Seed / Series A across Poland and the Central and Eastern Europe region (CEE). We back early-stage, post-traction startups with up to 3M of initial investment, and help them build global brands, while driving growth of the local startup ecosystem.\nWe take great pride in being close to top founders who think big.

''We are glad that over 270 individuals, during this campaign have understood the urgency and have taken the pledge to be more responsible about e-waste management and follow the right practices,'' he added.\nThe program was multi-forked, and this year Cerebra Greenpartnered with various enterprises, and NGOs to not only share information and spread awareness about the impact of e-waste, but also help collect e-waste across the country. This will lead to an increase in the number of large corporates that come forward to dispose their e-waste through the right means. In addition to the collection drive, Cerebra Greenalso introduced a pledge through an informative online quiz that educated consumers to dispose of their next e-waste in the right manner.\nCerebra Green set-up one of India's largest e-waste recycling plants in 2017 as a result of the need for e-waste recycling in India. Today, the company is equipped to meet the multiplying numbers of devices with the company's recycling plant running at a capacity of 40,000 Metric Tonnes. Looking to expand the much-needed infrastructure for e-waste recycling in the country, Cerebra Greenwill be establishing recycling facilities in the north and west Indiamarkets as well.\nAbout Cerebra Green: Cerebra Integrated Technologies Ltd.is a public listed company and is engaged in the business of e-waste recycling, refining and refurbishment, electronic manufacturing services and IT infrastructure management.

Thats why Governor Gavin Newsom said he is trying to bring some relief with an $11 billion spending package proposal. The national average for a gallon of gas according to Triple-A is $4.24. In California, the average price of gas is $5.88, and its $5.82 here in Bakersfield, both record prices across the state and locally. To help deal with that, the governor proposed $9 billion in direct payments to Californians.\nRecommended Stories\nAT&T Is Too Cheap to Ignore While Others 'Wait and See'\nIndeed, investors are frustrated with T, but after AT&T's investor day last Monday, the opportunity appears too compelling at the current price prior to the Discovery deal closing. AT&T is set to split off Warner Bros to Discovery shareholders, which is likely to occur in mid-April. The transaction will give T shareholders 0.24 of a share of the new Warner Bros Discovery (with all current Discovery shares getting wrapped in) for each share of T. The value T is getting is extrapolated from the current value of DISCA, 71% of a $62 billion company, so at the current price of around $26 for DISCA, T holders have about $6/share in Warner Bros Discovery value.\n2d ago\nRussia Central Banker Wanted Out Over Ukraine, Putin Said No\n(Bloomberg) -- Russias highly regarded central bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina sought to resign after Vladimir Putin ordered an invasion of Ukraine, only to be told by the president to stay, according to four people with knowledge of the discussions.Most Read from BloombergPutin Adviser Chubais Quits Over Ukraine War, Leaves RussiaChina Plane Crash Update: Black Box Dispatched; Calls to FlightWhere Mornings Would Get Darker Under Permanent Daylight Savings TimeChina Jets Nosedive From 29,000 F\n11h ago\nMarketWatch\nThe college kicked him out.

More than 80% of the firms it has assessed to date have either withdrawn their applications or been rejected.\n\"We've seen a high number of the cryptoasset businesses applying for registration not meeting standards there to help ensure firms are not used to transfer and or disguise criminal funds,\" the spokesperson said.\n\"Firms that do not meet the expected benchmark can withdraw their application.

The CIRM-funded study led by Dr. Krystof Bankiewicz, is one of the 64 clinical trials funded by the California state agency to date.\nParkinsons is a neurodegenerative movement disorder that affects one million people in the U.S alone and leads to shaking, stiffness, and problems with walking, balance, and coordination. It is caused by the breakdown and death of dopaminergic neurons, special nerve cells in the brain responsible for the production of dopamine, a chemical messenger that is crucial for normal brain activity.\nThe patient was treated at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center with a gene therapy designed to promote the production of a protein called GDNF, which is best known for its ability to protect dopaminergic neurons, the kind of cell damaged by Parkinsons. The treatment seeks to increase dopamine production in the brain, alleviating Parkinsons symptoms and potentially slowing down the disease progress.\nWe are pleased to support this multi-institution California collaboration with Ohio State to take a novel first-in-human gene therapy into a clinical trial for Parkinsons Disease. says Maria T. Millan, M.D., President and CEO of CIRM. This is the culmination of years of scientific research by the Bankiewicz team to improve upon previous attempts to translate the potential therapeutic effect of GDNF to the neurons damaged in the disease. We join the Parkinsons community in following the outcome of this vital research opportunity.\nCIRM Board Member and patient advocate David Higgins, Ph.D. is also excited about this latest development. For Dr. Higgins, advocating for Parkinsons is a very personal journey since he, his grandmother, and his uncle were diagnosed with the disease.\nOur best chance for developing better treatments forParkinsons is to test as many logical approaches aspossible. CIRM encourages out-of-the-box thinking byproviding funding for novel approaches. The Parkinsons community is a-buzz withexcitement about the GDNF approach and looks to CIRM to identify, fund, and promote these kinds of programs.\nIn a news release Dr. Sandra Kostyk, director of the Movement Disorders Divisionat Ohio State Wexner Medical Center said this approach involves infusing a gene therapy solution deep into a part of the brain affected by Parkinsons: This is a onetime treatment strategy that could have ongoing lifelong benefits. Though its hoped that this treatment will slow disease progression, we dont expect this strategy to completely stop or cure all aspects of the disease. Were cautiously optimistic as this research effort moves forward.\nOther trial sites located in California that are currently recruiting patients are the University of California, Irvine (UCI) and the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). Specifically, the Irvine trial site is using the UCI Alpha Stem Cell Clinic one of five leading medical centers throughout California that make up the CIRM Alpha Stem Cell Clinic (ASSC) Network. The ASSC Network specializes in the delivery of stem cell therapies by providing world-class, state of the art infrastructure to support clinical research.\nFor more information on the trial and enrollment eligibility, you can directly contact the study coordinators by email at the trial sites listed:\nThe Ohio State University:",

Ether, Dogecoin and last weeks sensation, Internet Computer, also retreated.This is the latest chapter of China tightening the noose around crypto, said Antoni Trenchev, managing partner and co-founder of Nexo in London, a crypto lender.Virtual currencies should not and cannot be used in the market because theyre not real currencies, according to a notice posted on the PBOCs official WeChat account. Financial and payments institutions are not allowed to price products or services with virtual currency, the notice said.The statement doesnt have any new regulatory steps, according to Yu Lingqu, a vice director at the China Development Institute think-tank in Shenzhen. The notice was conveyed by the central bank but compiled by industry associations rather than government officials, making it less powerful, according to Liu Yang, a lawyer at Beijing-based law firm DeHeng Law Offices.They just want caution, said Bobby Lee, founder and chief executive officer of crypto storage provider Ballet. They feel the market is over-hyped, theres speculative trading, theyre looking out for the best interests of the people.Beijing since 2017 has abolished initial coin offerings and clamped down on virtual currency trading within its borders, forcing many exchanges overseas. The country was once home to about 90% of trades but the lions share of mining and major players have since fled abroad.China has recently taken steps to issue its own digital yuan, seeking to replace cash and maintain control over a payments landscape that has become increasingly dominated by technology companies not regulated like banks.Its no surprise to me, as Chinese capital controls can be challenged by cryptocurrency purchases in the country and transfers out of the country, said Adam Reynolds, CEO for APAC at Saxo Markets. So avoiding use of them in the country is essential to maintaining capital controls. The only tolerable digital currency to a government with strong capital controls is their own CBDC.Many chartists and technical analysts are looking at Bitcoins 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI), which entered oversold levels Tuesday, as well as the 200-day moving average around $39,800.

The EV-makers retraction that it will accept Bitcoin as payment was the catalyst that accelerated the spread consolidation. Then over the weekend, little comments here and there have continued to confuse, he said.Meanwhile, the latest Bank of America fund manager survey showed that Long Bitcoin is the most crowded trade in the world right now. The poll captures 194 fund managers with $592 billion worth of assets under management overall.When an asset becomes the most crowded trade in the BofA survey, it has frequently signaled a near-term pullback in the past, said Matt Maley, chief market strategist for Miller Tabak + Co.

The deal implies a pre-investment valuation of $6.9 billion for The CrownX, the statement showed.Masan is in advanced talks with other investors on a further investment of $300 million to $400 million into The CrownX that is expected to close in 2021, the company said. Shares of the Vietnamese corporation rallied as much as 2.7% in early trading Tuesday.As part of the deal, the Vietnamese retail firm will team up with Alibabas Southeast Asian unit Lazada to expand its digital business in the country. Jack Mas corporation is seeking to expand its foothold in Southeast Asia, home to more than 650 million people, as competition and regulatory scrutiny intensify in its home market of China. Vietnams digital economy is forecast to grow to $52 billion by 2025, an annual 29% increase from 2020, according to estimates by Bain & Co., Google and Temasek.The move should strengthen Lazadas competitive position by broadening its offerings in groceries, similar to the RedMart acquisition in Singapore, Bloomberg Intelligence senior analyst Vey-Sern Ling said. The Southeast Asia e-commerce markets are nascent and Alibaba will probably invest much more in the future, especially since competition in the region is increasing.VinCommerce will provide groceries to Lazadas e-commerce platform in Vietnam and turn its physical stores into pick-up points for online orders, according to the statement. Groceries account for half of the countrys retail market and a quarter of consumer spending, but online penetration is still nascent, the statement said.Our immediate priority is to modernize Vietnams grocery market and develop an unparalleled consumer proposition from assortment to shopping experience, said Danny Le, chief executive officer of Masan Group.Masan Group is controlled by Vietnamese tycoon Nguyen Dang Quang. Founded in 1996, the Ho Chi Minh City-based firm is best-known for its fish sauce which it sells under brands including Chin-Su and Nam Ngu, according to its website.

Like a lot of employers, True Health New Mexico moved nearly all of its employees out of its office once the COVID-19 pandemic reached New Mexico last March.\nAn office of around 70 employees suddenly shrank to a skeleton crew of just three or four workers.\nAfter 16 months and countless webinars, however, True Health is gearing up to bring employees back into the office.\nMark Epstein, president and CEO of True Health, said declining infection rates and rising vaccination rates help him feel confident that employees can return to the office safely and effectively. After a gradual ramp-up over the summer, the organization is targeting September for a full return.\nADVERTISEMENT\nSkip\n................................................................\nI think that will allow us also to monitor how well the virus is under control in the community, Epstein said.\nLike many organizations in New Mexico and across the country, True Health is still working out precisely what that will look like for employees, many of whom have come to value the additional flexibility that comes from working from home while still missing the connectivity of an office environment.\nA nationwide survey from Morning Consult updated at the end of May shows that 69% of current remote workers would feel comfortable going back to the office, but a majority enjoys working remotely and feels productive doing so.\nEpstein said the organization plans to pursue a hybrid model, which he said would provide opportunities for collaboration while helping the company attract and retain employees who like the flexibility of working remotely.\nWe recognize that the labor market has changed, and we will be sometimes competing with folks from outside of New Mexico, Epstein said.\nSimilar conversations are taking place in boardrooms and break rooms across New Mexico. Heres a sampling of how large employers around the state are adapting to the new reality.\nOFFICIAL BEST PRACTICES PENDING\nDavid Morgan, spokesman for the NM Department of Health, said the agency is working to update its list of best practices in compliance with guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The state maintains a list of COVID-safe practices for employers through its All Together New Mexico program, which includes advice that employers should limit operations to remote work to the greatest extent possible.\nLooking down on Smith Plaza from the Student Union.

UNM has been operating under a tier system, where Tier 1 involves work that must be done on campus, Tier 2 involves working remotely, and Tier 3 involves not working because work is not needed at the time. University spokeswoman Cinnamon Blair wrote in an email that as the school prepares to phase back to campus, supervisors and employees have been working together to identify the appropriate tier by work function. Some supervisors have had discretion to allow a combination of any of the tiers with a mix of physical presence and telecommuting. Blair added that the UNM Health Sciences Center had a more accelerated phase back to in-person work last fall.\nGoing forward: The process of transitioning to full operations for fall 2021 will occur over the summer by Aug. 2, Blair wrote. Specific departmental plans will be made during the first part of July and finalized at the end of the month. Guidance will be issued in the coming weeks to support both supervisors and employees. Employees will be expected to follow established COVID safe practices.

Pre-pandemic, most Albuquerque employees did work at least part-time onsite, but when the coronavirus started, everyone went remote. As health guidelines eased in summer 2020, RS21 allowed some employees to come in with masks, social distancing and fever checks at the door, but most remained remote. In April, RS21 reopened its offices, starting at 30% capacity, and then increasing to 50% in early May and 75% now. But office policy has fundamentally changed. Individual workstations are no longer assigned to employees. Instead, they use a software system to reserve a desk any day they plan to come in, with about one-fourth of local employees currently onsite daily.\nGoing forward: The company may return to 100% capacity in late June. But the pandemic has converted RS21 into a hybrid firm where most people work remotely. Thats an operational advantage, allowing the company to hire new employees in communities across the country, said Chief Operations Officer Missi Rogers. Our employees have proven they can be productive, thrive and communicate and collaborate online as well as they did pre-pandemic, Rogers said.

Sometimes, however, heavy-chewing dogs can get so excited that they'll bite off large pieces that are hard to digest, Miller says.\n\"It's so yummy, and they eat it so fast, and, unfortunately, it can cause stomach upset. We can see GI obstructions and things that we don't want to be putting our pets at risk for,\" she says.\nRELATED:\nPetco to Stop Selling Electronic Shock Collars, Encourages 'Fear'-Free Training Methods\nIn a news release, Petco said it's removing the rawhide chews after 71 percent of its customers reported concernsincluding choking, digestibility, and ingredient originationabout rawhide in a 2019 customer survey. Similar concerns prompted a Georgia woman to sue a dog food company last year, alleging a rawhide chew caused her dog's death\nIf dog parents don't want any rawhide at all, Petco has more than\n100 rawhide-free products\nfor your pup to chomp on. Otherwise, there are dozens of highly digestible rawhide chewsto choose from that should still stimulate your dog mentally and physically.\n\"It's going to provide all of those things still for the pet, but [it's] just a safer product,\" Miller says.\nPetco's Whole Health Challenge\nPetco also announced Monday that it will kick off its three-week Whole Health challenge on April 5 to encourage pet parents to monitorand ultimately improvetheir animals' health. Pet owners who enter the challengewill be in the running to win one free year of Petco's Vital Care program\nWhole Health focuses on your pet's five health factorsphysical, mental, social, home, and accessibilitythat are all important to evaluate as we hopefully reach the end of the COVID-19 pandemic Miller specifically touched on your pet's social health, something you might need to consider after a year of isolation.\nSo before you head out for the dog park for the first time in 13 months, maybe consider some refresher training or socializing The same goes for pets who were adopted during the pandemic. They might not know anyone outside your immediate family, so they could have a harder time around other animals and people.\nRegardless of your pet's health, it's time for a checkup with your veterinarian as we exit the pandemic. Plus, it might've been hard to nail down an appointmentfor the past few months, so you're probably due.\n\"Regular checkups with your veterinarian is so critical, even outside the pandemic,\" Miller says.\nShare options",

        "utterance": "Health Care Hero\nUR Nursing grad surprised with $100K award in recognition of his selfless work on COVID front lines\nJose Perpignan 16N waited in front of his computer for an interview to begin one October morning, completely unaware he was moments away from winning a life-changing amount of money.\nOn live TV.\nThe popular morning show Live with Kelly and Ryan was holding a Healthcare Hero $100K Giveaway contest in collaboration with SoFi, a digital finance company, to recognize health care professionals for their work on the front lines during the pandemic. Perpignan knew his friend, Erika Hunt, had nominated him for the prize, but he thought producers were reaching out to clarify some of the information submitted about him.\nThen the shows executive producer, Michael Gelman, got on the line.\nJose is that you? Can you hear me? Can you see me? said Gelman, feigning a poor connection over Zoom.\nYeah, I can hear you, replied Jose.\nIm having a little bit of a bad connection. Hold on for one second. Let me try to fix it.\nJose? asked host Ryan Seacrest, Hey, its Ryan and Kelly Ripa!\nWe just thought wed let you know that you are the winner of our Healthcare Hero $100,000 giveaway! Ripa said excitedly.\nSurprised and nervous, Perpignan thanked the show, Erika, and family members who recognized his deep commitment to the nursing profession and the community.\nI dont know what to say! Im so grateful to have this help. It will put me in a space to focus more on my goals and giving back to the community, which is what Ive dreamed of doing for a very long time. It means so much to my family, my kids, and all of my friends. Were just so happy! said Perpignan.\nRecognizing that health care workers were among the hardest hit during the COVID-19 crisis, SoFi teamed up with Live with Kelly and Ryan to award $100,000 to one doctor, nurse, or physician assistant who has made a major difference in their community. Viewers were asked to submit nominations, which were judged on many criteria, including the impact that the individual made during the pandemic.\nMitigating the Effects of COVID-19\nPerpignan felt the sting of COVID-19 from the start. The pandemic put a halt to his full-time job at LiveOnNY, an organ transplant organization. To continue working full time, Perpignan picked up shifts as a care coordinator at the New York-Presbyterian Hospitals cardiothoracic intensive care unit, which forced him to quarantine away from his family for 14 days.\nIn addition to working 12-hour shifts at the hospital, Perpignan coordinated with the Greater New York City Black Nurses Association (GNYCBNA) chapter he co-founded to prevent the virus from hitting his Bronx neighborhood. The group picked up seniors prescriptions and groceries and provided personal protective equipment (PPE) to those who couldnt leave their homes.\nPerpignan and members of the GNYCBNA also hosted virtual meetings with other Black Nurses Associations in the surrounding areas to share what to expect when the virus hit their hospitals. They discussed how to advocate for PPE, what politicians to contact for resources, and where to go for emotional support.\nAt New York-Presbyterian Hospital, Perpignan, like many nurses, was the last person some patients saw before they succumbed to the virus. He remembered one particular nurse who eventually tested positive for COVID-19 after he came out of retirement to work on the front line. Perpignan held up a tablet while the patients wife spoke her last words to her husband.\nWhen thinking of those emotional moments, Perpignan said, I try to be as genuine and authentic as possible with my patients and family members. I start with condolences to the family, and I always touch light on the positives that I know of this person. Ill say, He went out fighting, and I know he did that with his family in his heart. I tried to rewrite his ending, He didnt just die from COVID-19 in the ICU, but he died because he wanted to come back to fight. Hes a hero.\nPerpignan explained thats why he likes working at LiveOnNY, If a 26-year old overdosed, I tell the parents their child didnt just die from overdosing, they saved eight lives.\nFinding His Niche in Nursing\nIts this innate sense of optimism and positivity that helped Perpignan find his true calling as a caregiver.\nA Brooklyn, NY, native, Perpignan, grew up in a 39-story building as the oldest of 10 children. He decided on a career in caring when his father, an emergency medical technician, brought an ambulance to his school's career day in first grade.\nPerpignan attended Binghamton University and graduated with a bachelors degree in Africana studies. During college, he shadowed a few physicians and fell in love with nursing, specifically the interactions between nurses and their patients and families.\nAfter graduation, he spent several years working as a patient care technician before he was accepted into the University of Rochester School of Nursings Accelerated Program for Non-Nurses.\nIt was at the UR School of Nursing that Perpignan truly felt at home. He was thankful for the schools holistic application review process, which identifies an applicants academic strengths, life experiences, and ethical character to determine their ability to contribute to a diverse learning environment and improve the health of individuals and communities. The UR School of Nursing saw Perpignans potential when other schools might have overlooked him.\nAs a student, Perpignan always went out of his way to learn the name of every student in his cohort, as well as the cohorts above and below him. He always admired Dean Kathy Rideout, EdD, PPCNP-BC, FNAP, for doing the same.\nDean Rideout shaped my mindset on what leadership is. I remember walking by her in the hallway and she said, Oh, hey Jose! I was amazed. How can she work in the hospital, run a nursing school, and still know everyones name? I pride myself on becoming the type of leader Kathy is, said Perpignan.\nBeginning His DNP Journey\nStarting in January, Perpignan will take the next step in his leadership journey, beginning the UR School of Nursings Post-Bachelor of Science to Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) program. The program is designed for nurses who wish to earn their DNP degree through an area of nurse practitioner or clinical nurse leader specialty.\nPerpignan will return to Rochester in the spring of 2022 with his family to complete the clinical portion of the program. He looks forward to starting this next chapter with his wife and two children in a new home.\nAccording to Perpignan, it was the GNYCBNA that prompted him to advance his nursing career. A lot of the mentors within the organization have their doctorates. Im the only one thats on the board that doesnt have a masters or a doctorate. The exposure of being around them opened my eyes to the resources, access, education, and plans they have. Thats what I want, he said.\nPerpignan shared his plans after he completes the program, I want to go in",

[Operator Instructions] After prepared remarks by the management team, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions].\nI would now like to turn the call over to our host today, Yuhua Ye, Sunlands' IR Representative. Please go ahead.\nYuhua Ye -- Investor Relations\nHello, everyone, and thank you for joining Sunlands' third quarter 2020 earnings conference call.

Following their prepared remarks, we will move into the Q&A session.\nBefore I hand it over to the management, I'd like to remind you of Sunlands' Safe Harbor statement in relation to today's call. Except for the historical information contained herein, certain of the matters discussed in this conference call are forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current trends, estimates and projections, and therefore, you should not place undue reliance on them.\nForward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties. A number of important factors could cause actual result to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement. For more information about the potential risks and uncertainties, please refer to the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Tongbo Liu.\nTongbo Liu -- Chief Executive Officer and Director\nThank you, Yuhua. Hello, everyone. Welcome to Sunlands' third quarter 2020 conference call.\nDespite the short-term impact on our operations of the COVID-19 pandemic in the first half of 2020, Sunlands delivered steady year-over-year increases, in both gross billings and net revenues in the third quarter. Our results were fueled by a combination of the recovering macroeconomic conditions in China, as well as the implementation of our optimization initiatives within our business.\nIn the third quarter, our gross billings reached RMB654.3 million, increasing by 6.6% year-over-year and 23.1% quarter-over-quarter. We attribute our strong gross billings results largely to improvements we made in sales efficiency, with new approaches to student acquisition, as well as our enhancing brand awareness and continuous upgrade to our product categories. Additionally, following the solid performance in the second quarter of 2020, net revenues increased 2.7% year-over-year to RMB541.6 million, exceeding the top end of our guidance by 4.2%. Moreover, our new enrollments reached over 140,000 in the third quarter, growing 47.8% year-over-year and 70.5% quarter-over-quarter.\nDuring the third quarter, we made further progress to balance our top line growth mix. Proving the [Indecipherable] of our long-term strategy in efforts to continually expand our portfolio of educational products and bring content innovation. While maintaining a leading market share in STE programs, master's degree-oriented programs and professional certification and skills programs continue to reveal good potential to become the next pillars among the company's offerings.\nLet me start with master's degree-oriented programs, which contributed around 31% to gross billings in the the third quarter. Compared with approximately 17% in the same quarter last year, the growth of master's oriented -- degree-oriented programs in terms of gross billings was phenomenal, registering 93.3% year-over-year and 48.4% quarter-over-quarter. This growth was primarily driven by increase in need from working professionals as uncertainties in the labor market remain in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, together with the increasing demand for talent with higher educational background.\nIn light of this, in order to enrich our program portfolio and address the increased demand for diversified and differentiated higher education. In the third quarter we further expanded our partnership with overseas universities, such as [Indecipherable] State University to provide joint offering programs.\nTaking to account our existing partners in the United States, The United Kingdom and Australia, we have now established joint offerings program with over 24 [Phonetic] universities. In line with our balanced growth strategy, this effort is designed to further enhance our attractiveness and competitiveness and complement our master's degree-oriented offerings.\nDue to the current macro conditions, in particular, international COVID related travel restrictions, we are seeing an uptick in demand for those international online focused joint offering programs. And we believe this trend will continue for foreseeable future. Based on current number of admission applications received for 2021 already announced by most universities in China, we expected the number of applicants for postgraduate entrance exams for 2021 admission to surpass the record of 3.41 million said for 2020.\nGiven this trend, also with feedback reports from our sales and marketing department, we have high confidence in the continuing favorable demand in this area. With our proven ability to bring compelling offerings to the market that many students needs, we see a sustainable growth pathway ahead in developing our portfolio of master's degree-oriented and joint offering programs. These programs also typically carry higher margins than our standard programs owing to their higher ASPs, with especially MBA programs.\nTo further implement our sustainable overall growth strategy, we continued to promote the [Indecipherable] course offerings targeting professional certification, vocational education and popular hobbies. I'm very pleased that this segment also delivered significant growth in gross billings in third quarter. It generated gross billings of RMB139.9 million, up 301.9% year-over-year and 135% quarter-over-quarter.\nIn the third quarter this segment accounted for 21.4% of our total gross billings, compared to 5.7% for the third quarter of 2019. The increase in this segment primarily stems from rising requirements from the labor market for workers and candidates equipped with occupational skill sets and professional qualifications to meet higher demanding roles and responsibilities.\nWith our course offerings presenting attractive ASPs than the shorter time durations than traditional [Indecipherable] options with a favorable growing demand in this segment in the long run. Moreover, we believe bandwidth from these courses are more likely to purchase services from [Indecipherable] when changing employ",

        "utterance": "In this June 6, 2017, file photo, a reporter holds up an example of the amount of fentanyl that can be deadly after a news conference about deaths from fentanyl exposure, at DEA Headquarters in Arlington, Va.\nCredit: Jacquelyn Martin / AP\nRare drugs designed to mimic the opioid fentanyl are showing up more often in urine samples from Penobscot County than any other county in the nation, according to a recent study. The findings are concerning to the authors, they said, since they come at a time when the fentanyl analogs are frequently being added to methamphetamine, creating a deadly combination.\nIn the study published in the Drug and Alcohol Dependence journal, the authors analyzed 300,000 urine drug tests from July 15, 2019, through March 12, 2020. Health professionals from all 50 states submitted urine samples to Millennium Health LLC, a commercial laboratory based in San Diego, to have them tested as part of patients routine care. The vast majority  295,647  had not been prescribed fentanyl for medical purposes.\nThe studys authors, who are all employees of Millennium Health, found that, of those patients testing positive for fentanyl without a fentanyl prescription, 40.55 percent had at least one fentanyl analog detected in their system, showing that copycat fentanyl is absolutely infiltrating the market for illicit substances, said Joseph Stanton, associate director of clinical affairs at Millennium Health and one of the studys authors.\nFentanyl analogs are usually produced in clandestine laboratories and, while they are chemically similar to fentanyl, they were specifically engineered to skirt U.S. law though the U.S. later banned them China is the principal source of fentanyl analogs, which has routed the drugs through the mail and Mexico, according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.\nSome drug dealers mix fentanyl analogs with other drugs, such as heroin, cocaine and methamphetamine. Mixing is cheaper for dealers because it takes only a small amount of a fentanyl analog to produce a high. However, its far riskier for users who dont always know what they are getting, evidenced by the fact that, in Maine, the average drug overdose death in 2019 involved three drugs Different analogs have different potencies, and they are not all well understood or well studied.\nOne well-known analog, however, is carfentanil, which, at 100 times the potency of fentanyl, was originally designed to sedate large animals such as elephants and moose. About 20 microgramsof carfentanil, which is less than a grain of salt, is enough to kill someone.\nOf the no-prescription, fentanyl-positive urine samples in the study, the counties that saw the highest positivity rates for more frequently found analogs such as carfentanil and acetyl fentanyl were in Kentucky and Ohio.\nBut the greatest percentage of urine samples showing traces of the least frequently found fentanyl analogs came from residents living in Penobscot County. Of those Penobscot County samples, 11.36 percent tested positive for at least one of seven rare analogs, such as acryl fentanyl.\nFor Dr. Noah Nesin, chief medical officer for Penobscot Community Health Care in Bangor, the data was startling. To have Penobscot County at the top of the list is distressing and a possible explanation as to why our overdose rates remain higher than the rest of the state, he said. PCHC does not send samples to Millennium Health.\nIn its other studies, Millennium Health can see methamphetamine use has been growing quickly in Maine  placing the state 10th nationally for its methamphetamine positivity rate among urine samples processed by Millennium Health. Maine has the fifth highest positivity rate in the nation for fentanyl, based on the laboratorys data. And for the number of samples showing a combination of methamphetamine and fentanyl, Maine ranks sixth, said Eric Dawson, the laboratorys vice president of clinical affairs.\nCombined with the recent evidence showing a high prevalence of rare fentanyl analogs in Penobscot County, it paints a very concerning picture of the state of Maine and that county specifically as it relates to those users, said Eric Dawson, vice president of clinical affairs at Millennium Health and a study author. As you start adding these things, you add to the risk of overdose.\nNeither Dawson nor Stanton know why the rare analogs appeared in Penobscot County in the eight months prior to the pandemic.\nNeither did Marcella Sorg, director of the Rural Drug and Alcohol Research Program within the University of Maine. But the results were not a surprise to her.\nI suppose thats unusual, but Maine has had fentanyl analogs present in the population since late 2012, she said.\nIn 2017, acryl fentanyl was involved in the drug death of one person in Maine, according to  Sorgs analysisof drug-related deaths that year. Butyryl fentanyl, another lesser-found analog, helped kill two people. Cyclopropyl fentanyl killed eight. And furanyl fentanyl, which the Millennium Health study didnt detect in its review, contributed to the deaths of 32 people in Maine that year. Maine has seen a variety of fentanyl analogs show up in the overdose data since.\nDifferent analogs seem to peak at different times. Its tough to get a real sense of why that may be, Stanton, with Millennium Health, said. But the authors hope that knowing more about the ever-changing makeup of the drugs in an area will help local providers and others have more informed conversations with people who are using drugs and enhance efforts to reduce overdoses, they said.\nSorg also questioned whether the studys sample size was large enough to protect against Penobscot County rising to the top of the list by chance. It is reasonable to assume that if the lesser-known analogs are in Penobscot County, they are also elsewhere in Maine, she said. Or, its possible Millennium Health tested Penobscot County samples at a particularly troublesome time.\nThey may have just happened to hit it when a bad batch showed up in the drug supply, she said.\nDr. Mark Publicker, an addiction specialist based in Portland who uses Millennium Health, agreed that the analogs may be common throughout the state. As for Penobscot Countys ranking, that may be a function of how many providers use Millennium, which may be greater than other areas in the state, he said.\nThe study does not reveal how many samples per county Millennium Health received. Because it is a private company, it doesnt disclose specific data about its customer base, Dawson said. But the company only analyzed counties where at least 10 samples tested positive for fentanyl, and 181 counties across 30 states met that bar. The lab detected the rarer group of fentanyl analogs in 56 counties across 16 states.\nOur data is limited to samples being sent to our lab from health care practitioners. It may not reflect the general population of users, but what we see for Maine is concerning, Dawson said.\nWhat is clear to Sorg from the study is that fentanyl an",

Total Brain today announced the addition of 12 new customers to its clinical care support client base. The company has also expanded relationships with several legacy clinical clients by as much as 30% compared to last year. Total Brain attributes this growth to a complete rebuild of its\nearlier in 2021.\nTotal Brain Logo (PRNewsfoto/MyBrainSolutions)\n\"Our long-term investment in upgrading Total Brain's technology to provide our clients with a more robust set of actionable data and tools is resonating,\" said\nMatthew Mund\n, CEO, Total Brain. \"We listened to behavioral health professionals nationwide.

The user is emailed a Covid certificate within minutes.\nIt was developed by Excalibur Healthcare Services founded by serial entrepreneur Sir Chris Evans, and Sensyne Health, a listed company founded and run by Lord Drayson, the former Labour Party politician.\nSensyne's technology, called MagnifEye, is embedded into the app and can read Excalibur's lateral flow test result through a smartphone camera.\nMagnifEye is already being used as part of the Department of Health & Social Cares Covid testing programme in the NHS and has read and recorded more than a million lateral flow tests.\nPCR and lateral flow tests compared\nSir Chris said the new test would \"revolutionise Covid self-testing and diagnostics for people in the UK, Europe and worldwide\".\nUntil now, we have been able to supply tests on their own but the certification for the complete system including the app has taken the diagnostic capability to a new level,\" he said.\nExcalibur was incorporated in January 2020, according to filings on Companies House, as the Covid pandemic began to spread around the world.\nThe digital test has been certified for use in the UK and Europe by what is called a notifiable body, an organisation tasked by governments with assessing products before they go on sale.\nIt was developed in Cambridge, but the tests are manufactured in China. They cost about 20 each.\nSensyne has generated 5.1m in sales from its licencing agreement with Excalibur, allowing the company to use MagnifEye in the lateral flow test.\nExcalibur would not reveal its sales figures, but said several million of its lateral flow tests have been shipped in the UK and internationally.\nSir Chris said there was a big market opportunity for the new digital test outside of foreign travel testing, such as testing staff in staff large offices.\nSales of the product could total at least tens of thousands of pounds in the next few months alone, a spokesman for Excalibur said.\nThis is a major scientific achievement and, we believe, a world first in developing a regulated software application using AI to enhance the accuracy of lateral flow testing and reporting,\" said Lord Drayson.\nRelated Topics",

        "utterance": "Singapore biotech firm Tychan starts final phase of Covid-19 antibody drug trials\nFriday, 11 Dec 2020 04:20 PM MYT\nThe team of researchers at Tychan, the biotech company that developed the antibody drug.  TODAY pic\nSINGAPORE, Dec 11  The Singapore-based biotechnology company Tychan hasstarted the third and final phase of its clinical trials on an antibody drug for patients with Covid-19 after it received the nod from the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) in October.\nThe trials, which began today, will involve 1,305 volunteers. The company is in the process of recruiting trial candidates.\nTrials for the drug, known as TY027, will be done at the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) and National University Hospital (NUH). Patients may also check if they are suitable for the trials at Changi General Hospital and Sengkang General Hospital. If so, they will be referred to SGH or NUH.\nOwing to the low incidence of the coronavirus in Singapore, the trials will also involve hospitals overseas, such as Israels Sheba Medical Centre.\nTY027 is being explored as a treatment forpatients with Covid-19 to slow the progression of the disease and speed up recovery. It could also provide temporary protection against infection from SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19.\nInfectious diseases expert Ooi Eng Eong, who co-founded Tychan, told reporters in a video conference today that the firm had chosen Israel as a partner because the country allows it to carry out studies in a similar fashion asSingapore.\nIsrael is also not overwhelmed by the pandemic and has the capacity to conduct the trials.\nIsrael has recorded more than 352,000 Covid-19 cases and 2,960deaths.\nProfessor Ooi, who is also deputy director of Duke-NUS Medical Schools emerging infectious diseases programme, was unable to reveal the other countries Tychan is in talks with because of a non-disclosure agreement.\nOn why Tychan has to tie up with other countries to conduct the trials, Prof Ooi said that Singapore has been successful in containing Covid-19 and, thus, there are not enough suitable candidates.\nCandidates for the trial must be Covid-19 patients within the first six days of illness.\nThe lack of suitable trial volunteers in Singapore is also why Tychan had delayed moving into the third phase of clinical trials, even though media reports previously quoted Prof Ooi saying they were slated to start in August.\nTY027 has been in development since February 25. It is a partnership between Tychan and a stable of government departments, including the Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Health and Economic Development Board.\nIn June, it entered the first phase of human trials, which involved 23 volunteers.\nProf Ooi said the Phase One trial went very well and the antibodies were so safe, with no serious adverse effects, that researchers increased the dosage from 20mg per kg to 30mg per kg.\nThe decision was made to give ourselves the best chance of eliciting a quick antiviral effect.\nHe added that researchers debated among themselves on whether to move to Phase Two trials  this phase would only further test whether the drug is safe. A decision was made to skip to Phase Three.\nPhase Two is not powered to address efficacy you cannot conclude that a drug works, only that it is safe and has a chance of working, he said. In this time of pandemic, and with all the uncertainty, we might as well go to the direct answer (in Phase Three).\nThe results of Phase Three trials will hinge on how quickly Tychan can recruit volunteers.\nVaccines alone not enough\nWhen asked how the antibody drug differs from a vaccine, Prof Ooi said that a vaccine alone would not get rid of Covid-19.\nFor example, he noted that the protection a vaccine offers against the disease is about 95 per cent. That means there is still a chance for vaccinated individuals to contract the virus.\nFurthermore, vaccination may not be suitable for patients undergoing cancer treatment or those with a history of allergies.\nMoreover, we do not know how long the protection from vaccines will last. At some point, as the vaccine immunity wanes, there is a chance that Covid-19 could reappear, he said.\nIt is thus important to have both forms of treatment.\nAn antibody drug will allow those unable to be vaccinated to be protected in some way, said Prof Ooi.\nHe does not foresee issues mass-producing TY027, as the technology for such production of antibody drugs is mature, compared with new vaccine production.\nTo really tackle this problem of a re-emergence of a Covid-19 epidemic... having treatment (with antibody drugs) for Covid-19 that really drives the virus load down, so that we do not get severe disease, is still important to prevent our healthcare system from being choked up with severe cases.

        "utterance": "Hospital creates calming pediatric space with nurses farm-inspired murals\nWestchester Medical Center Health Network\nNeighbors taking care of neighbors\nIts one of the hallmarks of community hospitals. Just as your neighborhood is familiar and comforting to you, so should be a pediatric care area in a hospital. MidHudson Regional Hospital, a member of WMCHealth, is creating a calming, neighborhood environment with mural art from one of its own, very talented nurse practitioners in the recently opened\nMaria Fareri Childrens Healthcare Services\n.\nIt is important for pediatric patients, and their parents, to feel a sense of security and calmness when they enter a hospital. So it is no surprise that MidHudson Regional Hospitals new pediatric areas are being transformed with brightly colored murals. This gives our patients a warm, comforting feeling, says Jenny Sung, MD, the hospitals pediatrics medical director. Now when a child and their parent(s) arrive at the new pediatric emergency room or the inpatient pediatric care area, they are welcomed into a kid-friendly, calming environment.\nGuidance from world-renowned experts\nWMCHealth networks world-renowned Maria Fareri Childrens Hospital located in Valhalla, the Hudson Valleys only acute care childrens hospital, oversees the childrens healthcare services in Poughkeepsie. Maria Fareri Childrens Hospital has a long tradition of creating themed neighborhoods within the walls of the hospital and using art and images in the hallways and rooms to create peaceful, calming environments that promote healing and security. Some examples of the neighborhoods themes found at Maria Fareri Childrens Hospital include sailing, literature and athletics. So it was natural that MidHudson Regional Hospital was going to create a neighborhood theme that would reflect the areas history and culture for its new pediatric inpatient area and new pediatric emergency room services.\nSelecting a neighborhood theme\nMidHudson Regional Hospital asked its workforce to select the theme that would transform the Maria Fareri Childrens Healthcare Services area at MidHudson Regional Hospital into a neighborhood. Employees suggested many interesting and creative choices, and one theme continually rose to the top: farming. During the selection process it became clear that many employees enjoy tending to their own vegetable gardens, planting flowers and some also care for livestock. So, farming was selected to honor the rich agricultural heritage of Dutchess County. The next step was to create a magical farming neighborhood for all to enjoy.\nTransforming into a neighborhood\nTo create this whimsical world, the talents of Pediatric Nurse Practitioner Elaine Suderio-Tirone and her daughter Viviane were secured. Suderio-Tirone and her daughter transformed blank spaces into brightly painted artwork depicting a friendly farming neighborhood, complete with fields and orchards, colorful flowers, cattle and horses, and rabbits and butterflies, among other locally found animals and plants.\nSuderio-Tirone, a board-certified family nurse practitioner who has a doctorate in nursing practice, enjoyed painting the engaging wallscapes with her 16-year-old daughter. Pediatric care is my passion I just love caring for children and the farm scenes weve painted add to the pediatric care we provide at MidHudson Regional Hospital, says Suderio-Tirone, who has specialized in pediatrics for more than 20 years.\nThe beautiful outdoor scenes we painted offer a soothing, playful environment and provide an important connection to our community, she adds. At the nurses station, for instance, we painted lots of flowers, and we have honey bees busily walking on them, pollinating them. I love that this ties into Poughkeepsies city seal a beehive surrounded by flying bees because Poughkeepsie has been a beehive of activity for centuries.\nMidHudson Regional Hospital also painted the new pediatric emergency room, and will soon paint the pediatric procedure room and eventually each pediatric patient room.\nWeve found that art like this reduces stress and increases childrens feelings of well-being, she says. Studies show paintings like ours can also improve clinical outcomes.\nCreating the paintings is also a stress reliever for Suderio-Tirone, she says. I enjoy painting. Its an avenue for me to step away from my professional life although in this case, it supports my professional life because it supports the children I care for.\nSuderio-Tirone says she wants the Hudson Valley community to know that infants, children and adolescents, from birth to age 18, who go to\nMaria Fareri Childrens Healthcare Services\nat MidHudson Regional Hospital will receive high quality medical care provided by pediatric and adolescent medicine specialists. And, patients will have access to the latest medical treatments and technology in a caring, neighborly environment.\nA pediatric emergency room and inpatient care services are now open at MidHudson Regional Hospital, in association with Maria Fareri Childrens Hospital, the Hudson Valleys only acute care childrens hospital. Both organizations are members of the Westchester Medical Center Health Network (WMCHealth). The new services are called\nMaria Fareri Childrens Healthcare Services at MidHudson Regional Hospita\nl.\nThe new emergency room and inpatient services will help meet the healthcare needs of local children from birth to age 18, with care delivered by pediatricians and emergency medicine specialists, along with pediatrics-trained nurses with recent clinical experience at Maria Fareri Childrens Hospital. The new emergency room can be accessed by calling 911, or arrival at the hospitals main emergency department entrance.\nAbout MidHudson Regional Hospital, a member of the Westchester Medical Center Health Network\nMidHudson Regional Hospital provides advanced medical care in the Mid-Hudson Valley.

Its Zingre and Associates from Ft. Scott and  we are in the midst of designing the new facility.\nWe only have a two-year lease for our current space which Mercy clearly indicated is not renewable, Postai said. We knew from the beginning that we would have to build a new clinic, which weve shared publically to the various groups weve talked with, including the city and county. To help make our startup affordable in Ft. Scott and give us time to plan, Mercy discounted the rent amount for us and  everyone in there, which is greatly appreciated.\nOverhead (electricity, gas, etc.) is extremely expensive in the existing space, as is ongoing maintenance on the building, Postai said.  So there is no way we could assume the financial burden of a 177,000 sq. ft. building that is only being minimally utilized. Others who have evaluated ownership of the building came to the same conclusion. We know Mercy recognizes that and have evaluated options including demolition although, to my knowledge, no final decision has been reached.\nCHC/SEK is planning on expanding its services to include dental care, mental health care, a womens center, more accessible pharmacy, etc. which cant be accomplished in the existing space we now occupy without a major investment in renovation in a building with a uncertain future, Postai said.  Our model of care also supports integration of services. For example, children coming in for their well child check may also have a visit with the dentist or someone struggling to manage their diabetes may meet with a therapist or a patient educator as part of their medical visit. Numerous support staff also coordinate care or work with special populations (e.g. expectant mothers)  which requires space within the clinic. So, were working with our Ft. Scott staff to determine what they want and need in a new building built specifically to support our one-stop approach or, as our vision says, Healthcare The Way It Should Be.'\n\nIn addition, CHC/SEK also  will assume responsibility of Mercys clinic in Columbus in January 2020, Postai said.\n We will be combining our existing Columbus clinic with Mercys clinic,  Postai said.  Mercy will continue to manage the hospital in Columbus which is owned by the city.\nPostai said CHC/SEK is also extending its reach into Oklahoma.\nCHC/SEK was one of 77 health centers in the U.S. to receive grants to open new health centers and we will be doing so in Miami and Wyandotte, Oklahoma, she said.  Our center in Miami is currently operated by Mercy who asked us if we would assume responsibility and we agreed to do so. The one in Wyandotte is in a school and will primarily serve the students, their families and school staff. We will have the clinics open before the end of the year.\n\nThe organization is also working to secure future doctors for the area, and former Mercy Hospital CEO Reta Baker was selected to administer the program to do just that.\nReta Baker is now CHC/SEKs Vice President of Clinical Education, with the office located in Pittsburg.\nWe also are working with the University of Kansas School of Medicine to establish a family practice residency program in southeast Kansas, Postai said. To provide administrative oversight of this program  and all of our clinical education students  is Reta Baker, former hospital CEO in Ft. Scott. She has been named VP/Clinical Education and her office is located in CHC/SEKs system office in Pittsburg.\nWith all the outreach activity of CHC/SEK, We are nearing 500 full-time employees, Postai said.\nHere is the list of CHS/SEK outreach from Krista Postai:\nCrawford County:  Our main clinic in Pittsburg plus a dental-only clinic downtown and we just opened a school-based health center in Pittsburg High School. A mobile medical van goes daily to the middle school and elementary schools. We also have the clinic in Arma.\nCherokee County  we have a clinic in Baxter Springs and Columbus.\nBourbon County  we have Walk-in Care and the main Ft. Scott clinic.\nLinn County  we have clinics in Mound City and Pleasanton.\nLabette County  we have a clinic in Parsons.\nMontgomery County  we have a clinic in Independence and three in Coffeyville  a main clinic, one in the elementary school and one in the middle/high school.\nAllen County  we have a clinic in Iola.\nWe will be opening two clinics in Ottawa County, OK in December  one in Miami and one in the Wyandotte Schools.\nWe also employ nurses in multiple schools, as well as behavioral health specialists throughout the region.\nCHCSEK offices are located at 3011 N.

Its Zingre and Associates from Ft. Scott and we are in the midst of designing the new facility.\nWe only have a two-year lease for our current space which Mercy clearly indicated is not renewable, Postai said. We knew from the beginning that we would have to build a new clinic, which weve shared publically to the various groups weve talked with, including the city and county. To help make our startup affordable in Ft. Scott and give us time to plan, Mercy discounted the rent amount for us and everyone in there, which is greatly appreciated.\nOverhead (electricity, gas, etc.) is extremely expensive in the existing space, as is ongoing maintenance on the building, Postai said. So there is no way we could assume the financial burden of a 177,000 sq. ft. building that is only being minimally utilized. Others who have evaluated ownership of the building came to the same conclusion. We know Mercy recognizes that and have evaluated options including demolition although, to my knowledge, no final decision has been reached.\nCHC/SEK is planning on expanding its services to include dental care, mental health care, a womens center, more accessible pharmacy, etc. which cant be accomplished in the existing space we now occupy without a major investment in renovation in a building with a uncertain future, Postai said. Our model of care also supports integration of services. For example, children coming in for their well child check may also have a visit with the dentist or someone struggling to manage their diabetes may meet with a therapist or a patient educator as part of their medical visit. Numerous support staff also coordinate care or work with special populations (e.g. expectant mothers) which requires space within the clinic. So, were working with our Ft. Scott staff to determine what they want and need in a new building built specifically to support our one-stop approach or, as our vision says, Healthcare The Way It Should Be.'\nIn addition, CHC/SEK also will assume responsibility of Mercys clinic in Columbus in January 2020, Postai said.\nWe will be combining our existing Columbus clinic with Mercys clinic, Postai said. Mercy will continue to manage the hospital in Columbus which is owned by the city.\nPostai said CHC/SEK is also extending its reach into Oklahoma.\nCHC/SEK was one of 77 health centers in the U.S. to receive grants to open new health centers and we will be doing so in Miami and Wyandotte, Oklahoma, she said. Our center in Miami is currently operated by Mercy who asked us if we would assume responsibility and we agreed to do so. The one in Wyandotte is in a school and will primarily serve the students, their families and school staff. We will have the clinics open before the end of the year.\nThe organization is also working to secure future doctors for the area, and former Mercy Hospital CEO Reta Baker was selected to administer the program to do just that.\nReta Baker is now CHC/SEKs Vice President of Clinical Education, with the office located in Pittsburg.\nWe also are working with the University of Kansas School of Medicine to establish a family practice residency program in southeast Kansas, Postai said. To provide administrative oversight of this program and all of our clinical education students is Reta Baker, former hospital CEO in Ft. Scott. She has been named VP/Clinical Education and her office is located in CHC/SEKs system office in Pittsburg.\nWith all the outreach activity of CHC/SEK, We are nearing 500 full-time employees, Postai said.\nHere is the list of CHS/SEK outreach from Krista Postai:\nCrawford County: Our main clinic in Pittsburg plus a dental-only clinic downtown and we just opened a school-based health center in Pittsburg High School. A mobile medical van goes daily to the middle school and elementary schools. We also have the clinic in Arma.\nCherokee County we have a clinic in Baxter Springs and Columbus.\nBourbon County we have Walk-in Care and the main Ft. Scott clinic.\nLinn County we have clinics in Mound City and Pleasanton.\nLabette County we have a clinic in Parsons.\nMontgomery County we have a clinic in Independence and three in Coffeyville a main clinic, one in the elementary school and one in the middle/high school.\nAllen County we have a clinic in Iola.\nWe will be opening two clinics in Ottawa County, OK in December one in Miami and one in the Wyandotte Schools.\nWe also employ nurses in multiple schools, as well as behavioral health specialists throughout the region.\nCHCSEK offices are located at 3011 N. Michigan, Pittsburg, KS 66762. The phone number is 620-235-1867.\nThe CHC/SEK Clinic in Fort Scotts number is 223-8040.\nShare this:",

        "utterance": "Case studies\nA project that involves keeping a close eye on the health of care home residents has been extended for a year after a trial showed impressive results.\nThe Docobo telehealth project was initially piloted for six months in two care homes in Maidstone, Kent. In the first three months, it resulted in a 32 per cent reduction in hospital admissions, a 25 per cent reduction in 999 calls, a 67 per cent reduction in 111 calls and a 44 per cent reduction in all GP contact.\nAs a result of this success, it is now running in four care homes, with three of the homes in Maidstone and one in Tonbridge. The project was paused during the first wave of COVID-19, but resumed and extended in September (2020).\nUsing a Docobo telehealth solution, staff at the care homes carry out simple health checks with residents each day and record these via a Docobo app.\nThis system is closely monitored by the Complex Care Team at Kent Community Health NHS Foundation Trust (KCHFT) which can instantly see if a residents health is stable or deteriorating. The team can then immediately step in with the most appropriate action, which might be as simple as carrying out increased observations to monitor a patient more closely, or tweaking a patients medication.\nKCHFT Project Manager Andy Platt said: We extended the project because the clinical team at KCHFT and staff at the first two care homes established an excellent relationship and a new way of working, which resulted in improved outcomes for the care home residents.\nThe result from the trial showed a clear reduction in unplanned hospital admissions and contact with emergency care services, which is vital for these key NHS services, and we expect the level of reductions we are seeing will remain the same, as the number of care homes we support increases.\nTogether with the excellent results we have achieved, its also important to realise how using this is benefitting care home residents. Their health is being closely monitored and any deterioration in their health is detected much quicker than before, resulting in spending less time with GPs and in hospital and more time feeling comfortable in their homes. A visit to A&E can be stressful and unsettling.\nThe project has seen KCHFT and care home staff monitoring residents with long-term conditions, such as heart failure, diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The care home staff do simple healthcare checks with residents each day and ask condition specific questions, such as have they felt dizzy, short of breath or more tired than normal. They record this information using the Docobo app, which is installed on a tablet.\nAndy said: The Complex Care Team at KCHFT closely monitors the data trends and will quickly detect if a residents health is deteriorating. We have set up parameters for each patient and if their observations fall outside of these, an alert is sent to the on duty complex care nurse who would then respond to the alert.\nThe project is reducing pressures on urgent care services. It also means the Complex Care Team can focus on the patients who urgently need the specialist care that they provide.\nThe care homes we worked with during the trial were very positive about this project and said it has resulted in their staff becoming more confident in looking after residents and carrying out basic observation checks, including blood pressure and temperature. It has helped improve their knowledge and skills.\nAndy has worked on the project with colleagues Steph Rhodes, Head of Long Term Services and Lauren Warburton, Operational Manager west Kent. It has been overseen by KCHFT Medical Director Sarah Phillips.\nThe care homes involved in the project are The Oast, Chippendayle Lodge and Eastfields, in Maidstone and Chestnut Lodge, Tonbridge.\nAndy ran a quality improvement (QI) project to help with the introduction of Docobo at the care homes. He aimed to reduce hospital admissions, calls to 999 and GP visits, each by 10 per cent, but far surpassed this initial target. One QI tool Andy used was a driver diagram, to help establish what action was needed to make an improvement.\nAdrian Flowerday, Managing Director and Co-founder of Docobo, said: Its brilliant to see the real benefits of remote monitoring for care home residents and the fantastic stats speak for themselves.\nDocobo has been working in Kent for some years now and the quality improvement route taken to develop the new way of working in care homes is something weve been happy to support the excellent team at Kent with. The great results are a combination of the people, process and technology coming together, so Id like to personally thank the staff at KCHFT and the care homes for the amazing outcomes, and the fact that it helps so much during the pandemic and lockdown, is great.

Please call the appointment line at 606-654-4693, Monday thru Friday from 9-5.\nStandard days and times for testing will be Mondays and Fridays 11am - 5pm and Saturday from 10am - 2 pm.\nWere not limiting it to residents or anything else, its just by appointment only and it takes an order from a doctor or family practice to get the test through the lab company. We can also set it up through our nurse practitioners so that we can write an order for them, PCHS CEO Terry Nichols said. We do bill insurance but there is no cost to the patient. If the patient doesnt have insurance there is a way in Kentucky and well get them set up so that it gets taken care of.\nPCHC is also doing antibody blood testing in their lab.\nThe antibody test is for people that think they have been exposed to it or think they may have had it in the past. They dont have to be showing any symptoms whatsoever, Nichols said. Again, it takes an order from their family practice or through our nurse practitioner, either way.\nThe drive-thru test is done with a swab of the nasal cavity and results are available within 48 to 72 hours. The hospital will pass the results along to the ordering physician who will then notify the patient.\nAs we do more tests, the time may extend out. We have some labs that initially got covered up and it was taking four to seven days, Nichols added. Right now its 48 to 72 hours.\nResults from the antibody test are usually available in 12 to 24 hours. Nichols said those times could also get lengthened as the number of tests being done increases.\nHe said PCHC is equipped to handle as many as 200 tests per day.\nFriday afternoon the hospital did a test run with Bell County Judge-Executive and Pineville Mayor Scott Madon among the first to be tested along with Jailer Gary Ferguson and Bell County Public Health Director Teresa Hunter and Health Department Nurse Supervisor Trissa Wilder.\nWhen Brock was about to receive the first test, Nichols said they had a special swab just for him and produced a five-foot swab as a joke. The actual testing was done by nurses Mary Bishop and Bonnie Browning.\nThat wasnt nearly as bad as I expected it to be, Brock said. I would definitely encourage everyone to come and get tested.\nSupport Local Journalism\nWeve been there for you, now were asking that you be there for us.

        "utterance": "5 November 2020\nCare home telehealth trial extended\nA project that involves keeping a close eye on the health of care home residents has been extended for a year after a trial showed impressive results.\nThe Docobo telehealth project was initially piloted for six months in two care homes in Maidstone, Kent. In the first three months, it resulted in a 32 per cent reduction in hospital admissions, a 25 per cent reduction in 999 calls, a 67 per cent reduction in 111 calls and a 44 per cent reduction in all GP contact.\nAs a result of this success, it is now running in four care homes, with three of the homes in Maidstone and one in Tonbridge. The project was paused during the first wave of COVID-19, but resumed and extended in September (2020).\nUsing a Docobo telehealth solution, staff at the care homes carry out simple health checks with residents each day and record these via a Docobo app.\nThis system is closely monitored by the Complex Care Team at Kent Community Health NHS Foundation Trust (KCHFT) which can instantly see if a residents health is stable or deteriorating. The team can then immediately step in with the most appropriate action, which might be as simple as carrying out increased observations to monitor a patient more closely, or tweaking a patients medication.\nKCHFT Project Manager Andy Platt said: We extended the project because the clinical team at KCHFT and staff at the first two care homes established an excellent relationship and a new way of working, which resulted in improved outcomes for the care home residents.\nThe result from the trial showed a clear reduction in unplanned hospital admissions and contact with emergency care services, which is vital for these key NHS services, and we expect the level of reductions we are seeing will remain the same, as the number of care homes we support increases.\nTogether with the excellent results we have achieved, its also important to realise how using this is benefitting care home residents. Their health is being closely monitored and any deterioration in their health is detected much quicker than before, resulting in spending less time with GPs and in hospital and more time feeling comfortable in their homes. A visit to A&E can be stressful and unsettling.\nThe project has seen KCHFT and care home staff monitoring residents with long-term conditions, such as heart failure, diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The care home staff do simple healthcare checks with residents each day and ask condition specific questions, such as have they felt dizzy, short of breath or more tired than normal. They record this information using the Docobo app, which is installed on a tablet.\nAndy said: The Complex Care Team at KCHFT closely monitors the data trends and will quickly detect if a residents health is deteriorating. We have set up parameters for each patient and if their observations fall outside of these, an alert is sent to the on duty complex care nurse who would then respond to the alert.\nThe project is reducing pressures on urgent care services. It also means the Complex Care Team can focus on the patients who urgently need the specialist care that they provide.\nThe care homes we worked with during the trial were very positive about this project and said it has resulted in their staff becoming more confident in looking after residents and carrying out basic observation checks, including blood pressure and temperature. It has helped improve their knowledge and skills.\nAndy has worked on the project with colleagues Steph Rhodes, Head of Long Term Services and Lauren Warburton, Operational Manager west Kent. It has been overseen by KCHFT Medical Director Sarah Phillips.\nThe care homes involved in the project are The Oast, Chippendayle Lodge and Eastfields, in Maidstone and Chestnut Lodge, Tonbridge.\nAndy ran a quality improvement (QI) project to help with the introduction of Docobo at the care homes. He aimed to reduce hospital admissions, calls to 999 and GP visits, each by 10 per cent, but far surpassed this initial target.\nAdrian Flowerday, Managing Director and Co-founder of Docobo, said: Its brilliant to see the real benefits of remote monitoring for care home residents and the fantastic stats speak for themselves.\nDocobo has been working in Kent for some years now and the quality improvement route taken to develop the new way of working in care homes is something weve been happy to support the excellent team at Kent with. The great results are a combination of the people, process and technology coming together, so Id like to personally thank the staff at KCHFT and the care homes for the amazing outcomes, and the fact that it helps so much during the pandemic and lockdown, is great.",

The consensus estimate for first-quarter 2022 earnings has also been revised 16.5% upward over the same time frame. The favorable estimate revisions instill investor confidence in the stock.\nPositive Earnings Surprise History\nReliance Steels earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average being 12.3%.\nSuperior Return on Equity (ROE)\nROE is a measure of a companys efficiency in utilizing shareholders funds. ROE for the trailing 12-months for Reliance Steel is 24.8%, above the industrys level of 23.9%.\nUpbeat Prospects\nDemand in non-residential construction, which is Reliance Steels biggest end-market, has gradually expanded and is nearing the pre-pandemic levels. Demand in this market is expected to remain healthy on solid bidding activity. The company expects non-residential construction activities to strengthen through 2022.\nReliance Steel is also witnessing strength in semiconductors and an accelerated recovery in the energy (oil and natural gas) market. Demand in the heavy industry also remains steady. The company is also seeing improved demand in commercial aerospace on a recovery in activities. It remains optimistic about the business environment and sees robust underlying demand in the majority of its end markets in the first quarter of 2022.\nThe company has also been following an aggressive acquisition strategy for a while as part of its core business policy to drive operating results.

The news of the transaction sent Whitings shares up some 1.8% to close at $84.96 and Oasis shares up around 5.5% to $152.45.\nThe companies stated that the merged entity will have the leading Williston Basin position in North Dakota and Montana, with top tier assets spanning over 972,000 net acres and an output of about 167,800 barrels of oil equivalent per day, an improved free cash flow generation and a substantial scale of operations.\nPer the terms of the transaction, Whiting shareholders will be given 0.5774 shares of OAS common stock and $6.25 in cash for each share of WLL stock held. Oasis shareholders will receive a special dividend of $15.00 per share ahead of the close. On the closing of the deal, which is expected to be done by the second half of this year, Whiting and Oasis shareholders will own approximately 53% and 47% in the merged company, respectively.\nMoreover, upon completion, Whitings President and CEO, Lynn Peterson, will serve as the Executive Chair of the Board of the merged entity, while Oasis CEO, Danny Brown, will become the President and CEO and also serve as a member of the Board. The combined company will be based in Houston, TX and will operate under a new name and trade under a new ticker, both of which will be declared in due time, per the companies.\nBoth the companies were hit hard by the pandemic-induced commodity price and demand destruction and were forced to declare bankruptcy in 2020. WLL and OAS subsequently restructured and emerged from Chapter 11 by management overhaul, cutting costs and cleaning up their balance sheets. Interestingly, at the time of the merger agreement, the commodity was trading near $120 a barrel the highest since 2008.\nFounded in 1980, Denver, CO-based Whiting Petroleum Corporation is an independent energy company engaged in the exploration, development and production of crude oil and natural gas properties in the United States. With the majority of its output coming from the Bakken play, it holds one of the largest acreage positions in the region.\nEstablished in 2007, Houston, TX-based Oasis Petroleum is an independent explorer, engaged in the acquisition and development of oil and natural gas resources. The companys asset base is primarily focused on the North Dakota and Montana regions of the Williston Basin, targeting the Bakken and Three Forks formations. Its total leasehold position in the Williston Basin consists of around 497,000 net acres. OAS top-tier operated locations provide an inventory life of more than 12 years, with break-even prices between $30 and $45 per barrel.\nBoth Whiting and Oasis currently carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The breath test machine is ultra-rapid and highly accurate, which can be hand-held, requires minimum training to conduct the test and can be offered at any point of care without the need of a laboratory, Canary Health Technologies said.\nThe test is based on technology that employs exhaled Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) found in human breath as biomarkers of the coronavirus. The screening is designed to detect the virus in people with and without symptoms.\nWe believe that our breath diagnostic platform is the future of Covid detection. The strength of our technology is that we can detect Covid within three minutes before the onset of symptoms, Raj Reddy, CEO, Canary Health Technologies, in a press release said.\nThe trial will include collecting breath samples from 750 people, both Covid-19 positive patients and those who do not have the virus. Participants will be asked to breathe into the device, which will then translate their breath biomarkers into electronic signals which transmit to a centralized lab in the cloud for analysis. Preliminary results are expected before the end of December 2020. If the trial is successful, Canary Health Technologies will seek approval from regulatory authorities.\nNow you can get handpicked stories from Telangana Today on\neveryday.

Between July and December 2018, the Fiat Linea posted a monthly sales average of only 12 units. Fiat India has chosen to shut shop instead of upgrading its slow-selling products. Fiat would have had to update the body structure of its ageing fleet and introduce several new safety features, including front seatbelt reminders, reverse parking sensors, ABS with EBD, and speed-alert warning, on all the trims.\nMahindra E2O\nMahindra & Mahindra will discontinue the E2O in the coming months. The small electric car has sold only 542 units between April-December 2018 and the company seems to have decided to axe its production instead of upgrading it to meet the stricter safety norms that come into effect later this year.\nMahindra Verito\nThe last-gen Logan was the first product to come from the joint venture between Mahindra & Mahindra and Renault India. That said, after the dissolution of the JV in 2010, M&M continued manufacturing and selling the Logan as the Mahindra Verito. A facelift was released in July 2012, but sales have been pretty low, with an average of just 117 units of the sedan and its 5-door version being sold between July-December 2018. The Verito will be discontinued in the coming months.\nMahindra Verito Vibe\nThe Verito Vibe is the aforementioned five-door version of the Logan-based sedan. It was introduced in June 2013, with its sub-4-metre overall length enabling the carmaker to price the new model more aggressively owing to lower taxation. Unfortunately, the Vibe has failed to find enough car buyers, which is mostly due to its oddball proportions and a dated interior. M&M appears to have already given up on the Vibe.\nMahindra Xylo\nLaunched in January 2009\n, the Mahindra Xylo was quick to establish a strong foothold in the commercial vehicle space.

This months edition of our Innovators of UMaine series showcases Neuright, a Maine-based biotech company co-founded by Kristy Townsend 02 Ph.D. (above right), and Magdalena Blaszkiewicz 19G, Ph.D. (center). The company is developing a medical device that will aid in the diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy, specifically the small-fiber neuropathy that can manifest through sensations such as pins-and-needles, numbness, and tingling. Peripheral neuropathy is common in patients with diabetes and those who are undergoing chemotherapy treatments, but the condition also occurs without obvious cause, and is stubbornly difficult to diagnose, Townsend and Blaszkiewicz say. The pair, working with collaborators at UMaine including Rosemary Smith, professor of electrical and chemical engineering (above left); Leonard Kass, associate professor of biological sciences; Nuri Emanetoglu, associate professor of electrical and computer engineering; and Ali Abedi, professor of electrical and computer engineering, have developed a microneedle electrode array thats designed to record nerve activity. The goal is to create a functional diagnostic tool for aging and diabetes-related small fiber neuropathy.\nNeuright evolved out of Blaszkiewiczs Ph.D. research in the Townsend Lab at UMaine. The founders developed a plan for commercialization through UMaines MIRTA Accelerator program, and Neuright is headquartered at the Upstart Center for Entrepreneurship. Now based at Ohio State, the Townsend Lab maintains close ties with research collaborators at UMaine and Neurights founders say they are committed to growing the company in Maine.\nThis month, Bear Tracks had a chance to catch up with the founders, who are wrapping up preclinical trials in mice (all conducted at UMaine with strong research support from undergraduate students) and preparing for clinical testing in humans.\nBT: What was the inspiration for your innovation?\nKT:\nThis really came out of Magdas Ph.D. research in my lab when I was faculty at UMaine. We were investigating the nerves in the adipose tissue, or fat tissue, thats under the skin, and how those change with obesity, diabetes, and aging. We found that the nerve density is reduced, indicating probable nerve death and neuropathy in the adipose. We wanted a tool to be able to measure functionally, that the nerves were not as active as they should be, and then look at what implications that would have for metabolic health, and health of our fat tissue, but there was just no way to do it. Its really hard to measure the function of the nerves in adipose we can look at molecular markers, and that sort of indicates how healthy and how functional they are, but theyre indirect measures. We assembled a team at UMaine and started to get prototypes together and began recording. At the time, we didnt think this was something that could be commercializable, or that it should be, but we were invited to take part in the first cohort of the MIRTA accelerator program at UMaine, and we did. What we learned was that our research needed to measure the function of these nerves in patients with neuropathy matched a clinical diagnostic need, and by developing a commercialization strategy and a spin-off company, we could help the technology be developed and hopefully become useful for patients.\nBT: How will your innovation impact people?\nMB:\nThrough [customer discovery in] the MIRTA program, we came to understand that physicians who are trying to diagnose small-fiber peripheral neuropathy are struggling with the tools available. Theyre having to use multiple tools and put patients through a battery of testing to get a final diagnosis, which is often a diagnosis of exclusion. For a patient who is experiencing pain, numbness, tingling and loss of sensation, the process is harrowing and doesnt always result in a definitive answer. Some patients spend years trying to get a diagnosis, and early-stage cases can be missed because existing methods cant detect reduced nerve function. Right now, there is no cure for peripheral neuropathy, but there are intervention measures that could slow the progress of the disease if it can be identified sooner. This technology would help patients get to a diagnosis faster and pursue treatment earlier. While clinicians will use the test first and make the diagnosis officially, were trying to be very patient centric in our design because its patients who want and need this technology to reach a more reliable answer even if there isnt an easy treatment.\nBT: What are your goals for your innovation? Where do you see it five years from now?\nMB:\nFive years from now, we hope to have been cleared by the FDA for marketing so we can have this device in clinics being used by physicians. We want to get the first phase of our concept out there as a diagnostic tool, but then continue evolving the platform. We see the device potentially being used to provide treatment or investigate whether certain treatments would work. We also hope to be able to collect neurological signature data from patients to better understand whats causing these neuropathies. Those data could help other researchers come up with more targeted therapies for the different types of peripheral neuropathy. So, as were getting the first iteration of the idea commercialized and out the door, were also going to be working on the next evolution to focus on treatment and understanding the cause of the disease by using our microneedle array to collect data that will help us get to biomarkers and biosignatures.\nBT: How do you see innovation in biotech benefitting Maine?\nKT:\nIm also on the board of directors for the Bioscience Association of Maine and we recently undertook a big data collection effort around what the biotech and bioscience space looks like in Maine.

West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures lost 5.5% to close at $109.33 per barrel, while natural gas prices fell 5.8% to end at $4.725 per million British thermal units (MMBtu).\nIt was a wild week for oil. After surging to a 14-year high of over $130 a barrel amid fears of Russian production squeeze, the commodity pulled back sharply on speculation that production from alternate sources will make up for the potential loss of output from Moscow. It should be noted that the negative price action overshadowed a report from the Energy Information Administration showing draws in crude and fuel stockpiles\nNatural gas tallied a weekly loss too, spooked by a mild weather outlook and the subsequent lull in demand.\nRecap of the Weeks Most-Important Stories\n1. U.S. upstream operators Whiting Petroleum and Oasis Petroleum jointly announced that both the companies signed agreements to combine in a $6-billion merger of equals transaction.\nThe companies stated that the merged entity will have the leading Williston Basin position in North Dakota and Montana, with top-tier assets spanning over 972,000 net acres and an output of about 167,800 barrels of oil equivalent per day, an improved free cash flow generation and a substantial scale of operations.\nPer the terms of the transaction, Whiting shareholders will be given 0.5774 shares of OAS common stock and $6.25 in cash for each share of WLL stock held. Oasis shareholders will receive a special dividend of $15.00 per share ahead of the close.

The energy giant, Shell, recently stated that it is withdrawing from the Russian oil and gas industry in a phased manner and is instantly discontinuing all spot purchases of Russian crude. This development is in line with the U.S. Governments new guidelines of banning the import of oil and other energy sources from Russia, in response to Russias military campaign in Ukraine.\nShell also declared that it would not renew any Russian term contracts and close its service stations, aviation fuels and lubricants operations in the country.

The prospect of having equity ownership is available to the native groups that already hold existing agreements with the 670 km-long development.\nThis project, in which TC Energy owns a 35% interest, while KKR and Alberta Investment Management together hold a 65% stake, has been opposed by environmentalists and First Nations (a term used to identify the native Canadian population) for several years as they contend that the pipeline trespasses the traditional native land.\nBuilt in British Columbia, Canada's westernmost province, the Coastal GasLink pipeline will have a preliminary transport capacity of 2.1 billion cubic feet per day. The project will transport natural gas from the Montney gas-producing region, the Groundbirch area west of Dawson Creek, to the permitted LNG Canada export facility near Kitimat.

Delek US Holdings stated that it signed a stock purchase and cooperation agreement with Carl Icahn and the Icahn Group for the buyback of $64 million worth, or approximately 50%, of Delek USs common stock owned by the Icahn Group for about $18.3 per share. The $18.30 figure is the closing price of DKs common shares on Mar 4, 2022, the last trading day preceding the agreements execution.\nPer the terms of the deal, the Icahn Group will pull out its nomination of directors and agree to a standstill restriction through the completion of Delek USs 2023 annual stockholders meeting and abstain from purchasing additional shares of the refiners common stock.\nDelek US mentioned that it would make use of the available cash in hand to fund this share repurchase program. The companies anticipate the share buyback to close ahead of Mar 11, 2022, bound by certain customary closing conditions, after which the Icahn Group is likely to own roughly 3.48 million common shares of Delek US, which represent about 4.93% of the company's outstanding shares.

Reuters reported last year that Sok was planning a 2018 flotation. Sok is one of four Turkish firms expected to list by May, sources said earlier this year.\nCompanies have been taking advantage of equity prices that remain near record highs in Istanbul, as well as robust international demand for Turkish listings. Despite deepening concerns about the outlook for politics, Turkey is home to Europes youngest population and economic growth remains strong.\nSok plans to raise at least $640 million through the listing, which will be used to repay all of its current debt, one of the bookrunners on the deal said. An over-allotment had yet to be decided, it said.\nSome 35-40 percent could be listed, a source said in February. The grocer is 39 percent owned by Gozde Girisim , the investment arm of food giant Yildiz Holding, which owns Godiva chocolate and McVities biscuits. It is half owned by a Netherlands-based investor consortium, while a private equity fund run by Templeton Asset Management holds 10 percent.\nSeparately, luxury retailer Beymen Magazacilik said it intended to proceed with an initial public offering of up to 46 percent of its capital, including an over-allotment.\nAs well as Sok and Beymen, clothing retailer DeFacto and logistics company U.N. Ro-Ro are also expected to list by May.\nOn Monday, DeFacto said it intended to proceed with its IPO on Borsa Istanbul, with Unlu Menkul and Citigroup Global Markets acting as joint global coordinators and joint bookrunners.\nJP Morgan, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse and Unlu Menkul are joint global coordinators on the Sok listing.

The key criterion is for the patients to be in the first seven days of illness,\" he said.\n\"Limiting the kind of patients we can enrol would give ourselves the best chance of showing, in as short a time as possible, and in as few patients as possible, that this drug works to prevent severe Covid-19.\"\nMonoclonal antibodies are immune system proteins that are created in the laboratory, and can be specially designed and engineered to target Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19.\nThe advantage is that these antibodies can be developed over several months and produced in large batches. A single injection may last for a few weeks.\nHalf of the 500 patients will receive a placebo in the double-blind trial, so that the drug's effectiveness can be tested, said Prof Ooi, who added that Tychan is looking to work with hospitals under SingHealth to recruit the patients.\nThe process of recruitment has not started yet, because the final trial is pending approval from the authorities - the Health Sciences Authority and an ethics board.\nProf Ooi said that ideally, all of the patients in the trial would come from Singapore so that the medical treatment given to them is standardised, but Tychan is open to having participants from other countries as well, although they would have to be chosen carefully.\nRelated Story",

Wakefield-based Safe Hands had been in discussions with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) before calling in administrators as the watchdog is due to oversee the currently unregulated funeral plan market from July. However, the firm stopped taking new orders and withdrew its application for FCA authorisation last month. The Joint administrators from FRP Advisory said their appointment \"was made by the directors of the company, after a period of severe financial challenge, which has left the business unsustainable in its current form\". \"The company has ceased to trade insofar as it will not be accepting any new customers but will be assisting current plan holders with contingency funeral planning services with the assistance of a third-party provider.\" It said that Dignity, the UK listed funeral provider, had agreed to \"temporarily provide existing customers with funeral planning services for a period of 14 days\". The administrators added that there were insufficient funds to enable refunds to be issued to all plan holders in full. But they expressed hope a buyer could be found. Customer money was held in a trust fund established by Safe Hands. But the administrators told plan holders on Thursday: \"Customer instalments appear to have been used by the company to acquire investments, subject to deductions for the costs of administering the funeral plans. \"Investments are understood by the Administrators to comprise a combination of equities, bonds, cash, real estate and loans.  \"The legal structure of these investments appears to be complicated and needs to be investigated to understand which of these investments can be realised for the benefit of plan holders. \"A dedicated UK based customer service team has been established... to assist you with any questions you may have in respect of the administration, the defined role of Dignity, the impact of the administration on your plan and any potential return of the money you have invested,\" the statement added. \"You will receive written communication in the post within the next seven days.\"",

Its IPO will help the company continue to study its drug candidate and expand its pipeline.\nHaving that kind of aura helps with everything we want to do running clinical trials,\" CEO Kevin Kochsaid in an interview following the IPO. \"It creates a different kind of company and attracts a different kind of employee.\nInscripta, a digital genome engineering company, had the first commercial shipment of its platform around the same time of its Series E round. The company said 2021 will be spent shipping more of its platform to first users and building out the organization.\nThis is a huge milestone for the company, said CEO Sri Kosarajuat the time. It signals a lot about what we think about the future. Inscripta is getting more visible, which helps us with our customers, helps us find talent and grow the organization. Its an exciting moment to be at Inscripta.\nThere was also a $100 million acquisition of Neos Therapeutics by Aytu BioPharma, formerly known as Aytu BioScience.\nMore than $80 million was raised in private capital. There were also more than 200 National Institutes of Health grants.\nCombined, the breakdown for private financing for the quarter was:\nPre-seed: $500,000\nSeries A: $5 million\nSeries B: $75 million\nThese remarkable numbers for the first quarter of 2021 demonstrate the health and strength of Colorados life sciences ecosystem, Emily Roberts vice president of CBSA, said in a prepared statement. The federal government sees the promise of research underway in our state. Private investors understand the potential of breakthroughs here. Public markets see the global impact of health innovations from Colorado. Additionally, support from the state of Colorado through the Advanced Industries Accelerator Grant Program advances our most promising companies. We anticipate an outstanding 2021.\nThe pace of financing in Colorado has been steadily increasing. In 2017 and 2018 there were $1.2 billion and $1 billion in total financing respectively. Just in the first quarter of 2021 alone, there has already been $704 million raised.\nRanked by Full-time employees companywide as of Nov. 1, 2020\nRank\nFull-time employees companywide as of Nov. 1, 2020\n1",
