It closed at 1.8160/70 marks.\n    Viermetz also said he did not see the U.S. Federal funds\nrate falling below six pct for fear of provoking an\nuncontrolled fall in the dollar.\n    But at the same time, worries about the international debt\ncrisis would mean there was little chance of a rise above 6-3/4\npct since this would increase loan costs to the third world.\n    The Middle East foreign exchange conference brings together\nmore than 200 traders and bank treasury chiefs from the Arab\nworld and Arab banks in European and U.S. Financial centres.\n    Formal discussions, which end today, have also centred on\nthe role of Arab banks in world financial markets, with bankers\nurging them to adapt to a new global trend towards\nsecuritisation of  business.\n    Hikmat Nashashibi, President of the Arab Bankers\nAssociation, said Arab banks have to shake off their old\nmentality of commercial banking and concentrate more on\ninvestment banking.\n REUTER\n",

There's no real\nreason for it to change policy,\" said Joseph Liro of S.G.\nWarburg and Co Inc.\n    Liro said the economy is showing moderate growth and does\nnot require immediate policy easing and the money aggregates\nmay well end March at the bottom of their target ranges.\n    All of the economists agreed that the Fed's major concern\nnow is recent weakness in the dollar which early this week was\nheavily supported by central banks. They said fear of hurting\nthe dollar will cause the Fed to be cautious in lowering\ninterest rates further.\n    Numbers released by the Fed today were all in line with\nexpectations and similar to the data for most of this year.\n    The Fed said that banks' net free reserves averaged 603 mln\ndlrs in the two-week statement period that ended on Wednesday\nversus 749 mln dlrs in the previous period.\n    In the single week to Wednesday, banks' borrowings at the\ndiscount window, less extended credits, averaged 302 mln dlrs\ncompared with 228 mln dlrs in the first week of the statement\nperiod. Meanwhile the Federal funds rate average edged up to\n6.14 pct from 6.08 pct.\n    The Fed's failure to add reserves in the market on Tuesday\nand Wednesday surprised some, but economists said the data\nreleased today suggest it had no real need to add reserves.\n    The Fed's absence may be explained by the lack of any\npressing need for it to supply reserves and by a desire to\nboost borrowings in the second week of the statement period to\nmeet its borrowings target, said Liro of Warburg.\n    Liro said the Fed probably is shooting for a two-week\nborrowings average of 300-325 mln dlrs. The borrowings actually\naveraged 265 mln dlrs in the latest statement period and that\nwas up from 191 mln dlrs in the prior period.\n    Brusca of Nikko agreed that the Fed probably is aiming for\ntwo-week average discount window borrowings of around 300 mln\ndlrs. He said that would correspond to a Federal funds rate of\naround 6.10 pct.\n    It is nearly impossible for the Fed to hit any borrowings\ntarget since the demand for excess reserves is erratic, said\nWells Fargo's Nathan. He said the Fed is focusing instead on\nthe funds rate and is trying to keep it roughly within a six to\n6-1/4 pct band.\n    Upward funds rate pressure and a big reserve-adding need\nare anticipated for the statement period that began today.\n More\n    Brusca believes the Fed will have to add 3.5 to four\nbillion dlrs a day in reserves in this statement period. Liro\nputs the add need at around 3.9 billion dlrs.\n    To partly address this requirement, many expect the Fed to\nadd permanent reserves with effect next Thursday by offering to\nbuy all maturities of Treasury bills on Wednesday. A similar\ncoupon \"pass\" may be required later.\n    There will be a greater demand for funds in this statement\nperiod because it includes the close of the quarter. Further\nupward pressure on the Federal funds rate may come from window\ndressing demand as the Japanese fiscal year ends on March 31.\n Reuter\n",

Privately, some bank\nofficials forecast the Bank will hold out at least for this\nweek, but at least one bank says a rise is possible tomorrow.\nIf a move comes before March 17, forecasts are for a half-point\ncut, with another half or full point about Budget day.\n REUTER\n",

However, the sources noted\na late temporao is always more susceptible to pod rot, which\nflourishes if conditions turn cold and humid, and which is more\nlikely from late July on.\n    This year's crop is doubly susceptible because poor prices\nmean farmers were not encouraged to invest in fertilisers and\ninsecticides and are also unlikely to treat against pod rot.\n    A severe attack of pod rot can cause the loss of over\n500,000 bags in a very short period, one source said.\n    Because of the increased exposure to pod rot damage,\nestimates of the final outcome of the temporao are extremely\nvulnerable and production could easily drop to below the 2.0\nmln bag mark if the disease hits.\n    Although flowering was good following the start of the\nrains, pod setting was not up to expectations, possibly because\nthe drought had caused a drop in the insect population which\npollinates flowers, the sources said.\n    However, reports from farms indicate moisture levels are\nnow generally back to near normal levels and that current\nflowering and pod setting is good, which should result in\nmature fruit from August through September.\n    The sources said they expect no break in the harvesting of\nbeans between the end of the temporao and the beginning of the\nmain crop, which officially starts on October 1.\n    \"The cut-off date is completely artificial. If things go\nwell from now on we should see heavy harvesting without a break\nfrom August through November or even December,\" one said.\n    If predictions of a 2.0 to 2.5 mln bag temporao prove\naccurate this would be below the 2.7 mln bag average for the\npast 10 years. The last poor temporao was in 1984 when\nprolonged drought and later pod rot cut production to 1.79 mln\nbags, the lowest since 1974.\n    Good growing conditions the following year produced a\ntemporao of 3.12 mln bags, just below the 1983 3.17 mln bag\nrecord, while last year's output, which also suffered some\ndrought damage, was 2.77 mln bags.\n    Figures for the coming temporao might be distorted upwards\nby the inclusion of undeclared current main crop beans.\n    The sources said large quantities of beans are believed to\nhave been undeclared from this year's record total harvest and\nthey were unsure how much of this would be unregistered by the\nend of the official crop year on April 30.\n    Recent official arrivals figures have been swollen by the\ninclusion of beans which had been delivered previously to port\nwarehouses but not declared.\n    Because of the high turnover of beans this year,\nsignificant amounts have deteriorated because they were stored\ntoo long at the back of warehouses. Some of these are expected\nto be held for mixing in with early temporao arrivals.\n    With official arrivals figures for the 1986/87 temporao and\nmain crops totalling over 6.1 mln bags, and over seven weeks\nstill to go to the end of the year, the total outturn should be\nat least a record 6.5 mln bags if all production is declared,\nthe sources said.\n    This would compare with the previous record set last year\nof 6.03 mln.\n    However, there is no way of telling how many current crop\nbeans will be declared after the May 1 start of the temporao\nand thus the true size of the 1986/87 harvest may never be\nofficially registered.\n Reuter\n",

You'll find poeple who think we haven't\navoided violating agreements.\"\n    In a key concession made at the urging of the powerful\nchairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, the trade\nsubcommittee backed off a requirement that would have forced\nReagan to automatically impose quotas or tariffs on imports\nfrom countries that engage in unfair trade practices.\n    It also agreed he may waive any retaliation if it would\nhurt the U.S. economy.\n    Ways and Means chairman Dan Rostenkowski, an Illinois\nDemocrat, insisted the more moderate approach was necessary if\nthe House wanted to pass a bill Reagan would sign into law.\n    Reagan last year had blocked Senate consideration of a\ntough House trade bill he branded as protectionist and this\nyear only reluctantly agreed to support a trade bill when he\nsaw Democratic leaders were determined to pass a bill.\n    As an indication of his success, White House spokesman\nMarlin Fitzwater told reporters Friday the administration still\ndid not like some provisions. But he added, \"Generally we feel\nvery good about the bipartisan consideration of the trade\nlegislation. I think we are progressing very well.\"\n    The first battle will take place next week when the full\nHouse Ways and Means Committee considers an amendment by Rep.\nRichard Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat, to force countries such\nas Japan, South Korea and Taiwan to cut their trade surpluses\nwith the United States.\n    The subcommittee limited the Gephardt plan to provide only\nthat the existence of a large trade surplus with the United\nStates will trigger an investigation of unfair trade practices,\nbut would not automatically set off retaliation.\n    Rep. Phil Crane, an Illinois Republican and staunch free\ntrader, said he will try to further weaken the Gephardt plan.\n    Organized labor has pressed lawmakers for more relief from\nimports where jobs have been lost to foreign competition.\nAFL-CIO president Lane Kirkland this year angered the\nadministration in a statement that any trade bill Reagan would\nsign would not be worth passage in Congress.\n    But Rostenkowski set the tone of the trade debate in a\nstatement, \"I'm not trying to write legislation to please Lane\nKirkland. I'm trying to write legislation that will be signed\nby the president.\"\n    In writing the bill, the subcommittee rejected calls for\ntrade relief for specific industries such as textiles.\n    Rep. Ed Jenkins, a Democrat from Georgia, agreed to hold\noff his fight. He intends to push separately a bill to protect\nthe domestic textile and shoe industry, an aide said. Reagan\nvetoed a similar measure last year.\n    House Speaker Jim Wright, a Texas Democrat, is one of the\nmost influential proponents of aid for specific industries\nbeset by low priced foreign competition.\n    Wright Thursday renewed his call for import relief for the\ndomestic oil industry and announced his support for a Senate\nplan to trigger a temporary oil import tariff when imports\nreach half of domestic consumption.\n    For the most part, the trade bill's provisions toughen U.S.\nenforcement of trade laws. The bill forces the administration\nto act rapidly on complaints of unfair trade practices such as\ndumping products in the United States at prices below the cost\nof production.\n    It also forces the administration to act rapidly when an\nindustry complains that a surge in imports threatens its\nexistence. Congressmen said the change would have required the\nU.S. International Trade Commission to impose limits on car\nimports in 1981.\n Reuter\n",

        "utterance": "The shareholders of Illinois\nCooperative Futures Co., the futures trading arm of many\nMidwest farm cooperatives for more than 25 years, will vote\nWednesday on its possible dissolution.\n    The directors of the company called a special meeting and\nrecommended its dissolution last month, citing falling volume\nand increasing costs.\n    Sources close to the organization told Reuters the pullout\nof Growmark, Inc., which holds more than 70 pct of the capital\nstock, led to the call for dissolution.\n    The possible demise of the cooperative has set clearing\nhouses scrambling for the trading business of the 85 regional\nand local cooperatives that comprise its membership.\n    Ironically, it was Growmark, at that time a regional farm\ncooperative with major river terminal elevators, that founded\nIllinois Cooperative Futures on December 1, 1960.\n    But Growmark became affiliated last year with Archer\nDaniels Midland of Decatur, Ill., and markets its grain through\na joint subsidiary of the two companies, ADM/Growmark.\n    With that relationship, Growmark no longer needs to trade\nfutures through the cooperative, said Tom Mulligan, president\nof the co-op.\n    Membership in the company, which Mulligan termed a\ncooperative of cooperatives, has declined from 99 in 1982. A\nnotable loss was AgriIndustries of Iowa, which became\naffiliated with Cargill, Inc.\n    Illinois Co-op's other members include such regional\ncooperatives as Indiana Grain, based in Indianapolis, Goldkist,\nof Atlanta, Ga., Midstates in Toledo, Ohio, Farmland Industries\nin Kansas City, Mo., Farmers Commodities, Des Moines, and\nHarvest States in Minneapolis.\n    Some observors said the demise of Illinois Cooperative\nFutures Co. is a serious blow to the cooperative system.\n    Instead of banding together, the individual cooperatives\nare forced to go their own ways, said the floor manager of one\ncash house at the Chicago Board of Trade.\n    Such a move would destroy the cohesiveness that gives farm\ncooperatives an advantage in the market at a time that a few\nmajor commercial companies are growing dominant, he said.\n    Don Hanes, vice president for communications with the\nNational Council of Farm Cooperatives, said 5,600 cooperatives\nexist today, down from 6,700 five years ago.\n    \"The period we've gone through in the past five years has\nbeen quite a crunch,\" he said. \"There's been a lot of\nconsolidation in the marketing co-ops.\"\n    One problem, he said, is the co-ops sell the grain to the\nmajor commercials for export, rather than exporting it\nthemselves, losing potential profits.\n    But exporting grain requires heavy investments, and the\nmulti-million-dollar loss posted six years ago by Farmers\nExport Co., a co-op set up to export grains, served \"to make\nfolks gun-shy,\" Hanes said.\n    Mulligan said he believes the dissolution, if it is\napproved, is a result of change in the futures industry rather\nthan a change in U.S. agricultural economics.\n    A grain dealer at one member co-op said the futures arm\n\"was a convenience, something that saved us a little bit of\nmoney. (Its dissolution) will force us to change our way of\ndoing business.\"\n    \"We're sorry to see the co-op go by the wayside,\" he said.\n\"But there are lot of people out there to do business with.\nThere are plenty of capable firms.\"\n    Steven W. Cavanaugh, vice president for grain marketing\nwith Indiana Grain, said he would prefer to trade futures\nthrough a Chicago-based cooperative.\n    \"In terms of clearing our business as a unit as opposed to\nindividuals, there would be economic savings,\" he said but\nadded, \"The times change and with changing times, come\ndifferent opinions of what businesses ought to be around.\"\n    Cavanaugh said the possible demise of the futures arm had\nnothing to do with its profitability. \"I would guarantee you\nthat this company is not in trouble. It is a sound, healthy\norganization.\"\n    In the year ended February 28, 1986, the Illinois\nCooperative reported income of 10.2 mln dlrs and members'\nequity, or net worth, of 8.3 mln dlrs. The annual report for\nthe most recent year has not been filed.\n    Under the cooperative system, income from operations is\nreturned as \"patronage refunds\" to the members.\n    Income and refunds in the past five years have been\ndeclining. In the year ended February 28, 1982, the co-op\nreported income of 17.4 mln dlrs and patronage refunds of 17.0\nmln dlrs. Patronage refunds in the year ended February 28,\n1986, totalled 9.5 mln dlrs.\n    \"You're dealing with substantially lower volume,\" Mulligan\nsaid. \"Lower volume translates into higher costs.\"\n    According to the company's 1986 annual report, Growmark\nowns 90 pct of the preferred shares and four pct of the common\nshares of Illinois Cooperative Futures Co.\n    Mulligan declined to speculate on how much of the capital\nGrowmark is entitled to. He said he could not determine the\nfigure unless the shareholders decide in favor of dissolution.\nEquity is distributed according to each member's trading volume\nand, as a result, changes from year to year.\n    However, Mulligan said the company could continue to meet\nminimum capital requirements to trade futures even if Growmark\npulled out.\n Reuter\n",

For years the softly-spoken economist has been\nwarning in speech after speech that excessive money supply\ngrowth would eventually lead to rising prices.\n    Schlesinger now has a majority of support in the Bundesbank\ncouncil, and since late summer Poehl has had to represent his\nviews, bankers said.\n    \"Poehl is in a minority in his own house,\" said Commerzbank's\nPfister.\n    \"Poehl is in a dilemma. He must follow a policy that is not\nentirely his own,\" said another economist.\n    The dilemma is that if German interest rates rise too far,\nthey will attract funds into the country, pushing up the mark\nand hurting West German exporters.\n    The dollar has now shed some seven pfennigs since the\nBundesbank's new tack became clear in early October.\n    Since last Thursday, United States Treasury Secretary James\nBaker has criticized the Bundesbank rate increases.\n    Bankers said this could foreshadow a revival of the 1986\nwar of words between the U.S. And West Germany, in which U.S.\nOfficials talked down the dollar to force West Germany to\nstimulate its economy and thus suck in more U.S. Exports.\n    One way West Germany agreed to do this was making a round\nof tax cuts worth 39 billion marks from 1990.\n    But financing these tax cuts has proved more difficult for\nStoltenberg than he had bargained for.\n    The cool, unflappable northerner, who was regularly voted\nmost popular government politician last year, had to face\nresistance from local barons in the government coalition\nparties and from trade unions to his planned subsidy cuts.\n    The withholding tax was intended to plug one gap by raising\n4.3 billion marks.\n    But it has caused an outcry among bankers, who say it will\npush up borrowing costs. The extra amount this costs the\ngovernment could wipe out the revenue the tax brings in.\n    Meanwhile Stoltenberg is dealing with a local political row\nwhich has turned into the country's worst political scandal.\n    Stoltenberg had to leave monetary talks in Washington last\nmonth early to sort out a row in the northern state of\nSchleswig-Holstein, where he heads the ruling CDU party.\n    The state's CDU premier, Uwe Barschel, had to resign after\nallegations of a \"dirty tricks\" election campaign led to heavy\nlosses for the CDU in state elections.\n    Barschel was found dead in a hotel bath in Geneva last\nweekend. Police say the death appears to have been suicide.\n    Cooperation between Poehl and Stoltenberg is all the more\nremarkable as Poehl is in the opposition Social Democrats, and\nwas appointed by former chancellor Helmut Schmidt.\n    When Poehl's contract came up for renewal earlier this\nyear, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's CDU-led coalition government\ngave Poehl another eight-year term.\n    Werner Chrobok, managing partner at Bethmann Bank, said he\nhoped the two men would soon be of one opinion again.\n    But when Poehl criticized Stoltenberg's tax plans he was\nnot only voicing what many bankers felt but demonstrating the\nBundesbank's independence of government, Chrobok said.\n REUTER\n",

Dollar, independent economist Len Bayliss said.\n    Bayliss, a former economist with the Reserve Bank and the\nBank of New Zealand, said a major depreciation is needed to\nrestore export competitiveness even if inflation is cut by\ncurrent government policies.\n    The taxes would help cut the budget deficit, which in turn\nwould lower the value of the N.Z. Dollar, he said in a speech.\nHe added that the deficit for the year ending March 1988 could\nbe much higher than the government's 1.3 billion dlr forecast.\n    Since the government was unlikely to cut expenditure as a\npercentage of gross domestic product, a major tax increase was\nprobably unavoidable, Bayliss said.\n    He would have preferred an increase in the 10 pct\nvalue-added goods and services tax, introduced in October 1986,\nbut that would have had a short-term inflationary impact.\nImport tariffs should be lowered to minimise the inflationary\nimpact of a currency depreciation.\n    The government had failed to bring inflation down despite\nlower oil prices and an appreciation in the currency, he added.\n    New Zealand's inflation rate was 16.9 pct in the year to\nend-September against 18.9 pct in the year to end June.\n    The major deficiency in the government's anti-inflation\npolicies was reliance on high interest and exchange rates and\ninsufficient emphasis on reducing the budget deficit, Bayliss\nsaid. The government had also failed to reduce overseas debt\nand debt ratios and cut the balance of payments deficit.\n    \"The widespread belief that (New Zealand's) problems are\ngoing to take much longer to solve than was originally thought\nis soundly based -- primarily because the government's\nmacro-economic policies have been unsuccessful,\" Bayliss said.\n REUTER\n",

The five institutes had jointly forecast\nthree pct 1987 growth in October last year.\n    Taking a dissenting view, the DIW institute of West Berlin\nand Munich's Ifo institute predicted only one pct 1987 growth.\n    The joint report said that the estimates of economic\ndevelopment made by the DIW and Ifo were \"markedly less\nfavourable\" than those of the other three.\n    The DIW and Ifo forecast the economy would pick up after a\nslow start to the year. \"In the second half of 1987 there will,\nhowever, only be a weak upward movement,\" they said.\n    The two institutes said external economic factors which\nwere currently damaging exports and pushing up imports would\ndominate the economic environment throughout the year. They saw\nexports falling by a real 2-1/2 pct in 1987 and predicted no\nmarked improvement in the course of the year.\n    The other three institutes, however, wrote: \"The decline in\ndemand and production (seen) in the winter months does not\nindicate the beginning of a cyclical downswing.\"\n    They said the sharp rise of the mark had led to corporate\nuncertainty and companies had not carried out investment plans.\nBut they expected that many investments had not been cancelled\nbut only put off. \"It can be presumed that the braking actions\n(on the economy) will diminish markedly this year.\"\n    They added: \"The domestic prerequisites for a continuation\nof the economic uptrend are still favourable.\"\n    These three institutes said diminishing external burdens\ncombined with favourable domestic conditions meant an upturn in\ndemand and production could be expected by the spring.\n    However, this projection was clouded by risks including the\nfurther development of the mark against the dollar.\n    Contrary to the DIW and Ifo, the three institutes said that\nwhile exports would continue to be the weak point of the\neconomy in 1987, \"there is good reason to believe that exports\nwill soon bottom out and that a slight rise will emerge during\nthe course of the year.\" They predicted an overall 0.5 pct fall\nin exports in 1987, the same as in 1986.\n    The three more positive institutes saw private consumption\nrising by four pct in 1987, compared with 4.2 pct in 1986,\nwhile DIW and Ifo predicted a three pct increase.\n    They saw the climate for equipment investment improving but\npredicted only a rise of four pct in 1987 against 4.6 pct in\n1986. Ifo and DIW saw these investments rising by only two pct.\n    All the institutes predicted only a slight decline in\nunemployment. The Kiel, Hamburg and Essen institutes said the\njobless total would average 2.17 mln in 1987 compared with 2.23\nmln in 1986 and predicted a rise in the number of people in\nwork of about 200,000.\n    These three institutes said new jobs would be created\nmainly in the private services sector and also by the state in\nthe context of job creation measures. The construction industry\nwas likely to engage new workers for the first time since 1980\nbut they predicted either no rise in employment in the\nmanufactured goods industry or only a slight expansion.\n    The DIW and Ifo said rises in employment would occur only\nin the tertiary sector, while \"the number employed in the\nmanufacturing industry will decline.\"\n    The DIW and Ifo said unemployment would only decline to\n2.20 mln in 1987 from 2.23 mln in 1986.\n    They saw the current account surplus falling in 1987 to 58\nbillion marks from 78 billion in 1986.

It rose 3.6 pct in Jan-Sept 1987.\n    Talyzin said national income, the nearest Soviet equivalent\nto gross national product, should rise by 4.3 pct against a\nplanned 4.1 pct this year. Gross national product measures the\noutput of a country's goods and services.\n    He said the Kremlin planned to produce 235 mln tonnes of\ngrain in 1988 versus a planned 232 mln this year. Moscow\nproduced 210 mln tonnes in 1986.\n    Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev has described\nmachine-builing as a sector whose rapid modernization is\nessential if the Soviet Union is to compete effectively on\nworld markets.\n    \"Certain difficulties have arisen this year in the\nmachine-building industry. The economy is not receiving a\nconsiderable amount of the equipment that it requires,\" said\nTalyzin, who heads the state planning committee GOSPLAN.\n    Soviet data show the machine-building industry, which makes\nmachine tools, instruments and other engineering goods,\nincreased output by 3.3 pct in the first nine months of 1987\ncompared with the same period last year.\n    However, this was far below the 7.3 pct increase planned\nfor the industry for the whole of 1988.\n    Talyzin said the ruling Politburo had concluded at a recent\nmeeting that an improvement in economic performance depended to\na large extent on conserving resources better. \"Large-scale\nmeasures are planned to save resources,\" he said.\n    Finance Minister Boris Gostev told the Supreme Soviet that\ndefense spending in 1988 would total 32 billion dlrs, the same\nfigure as was announced last year.\n    Western governments view official Soviet estimates for\ndefense spending as highly understated, but say the real figure\nis hard to calculate because Soviet military industries are\nintertwined with the civilian economy.\n    Talyzin said the Kremlin also decided to increase spending\nnext year on medical services, education, pensions and social\ninsurance schemes.\n Reuter\n",

Taken together, the four\nAmerican-led warrant issues raised only about 50 mln Swiss\nfrancs.\n    But banks believe the vehicle meets a need of investors and\npredicted a lively future.\n    Andrew Barrett of Citicorp Investment Bank (Switzerland) AG\nsaid: \"The warrants give smaller investors a chance to have a\nlong-term investment in gold with limited risk.\"\n    Citicorp in Zurich launched the first of these warrants on\nFebruary 27, following it up with a second issue less than a\nweek later. The issuer in both cases was Citibank NA.\n    The idea found some quick copies. Goldman Sachs in Zurich\norganized and co-led an issue for the Swiss branch of Banque\nIndosuez on March 9 and last night Morgan Guaranty\n(Switzerland) AG did another for Morgan Guaranty Trust Co of\nNew York.\n    The four issues now offer investors striking prices for\ngold ranging from the Indosuez issue at 410 dlrs an ounce, the\nsame price as the underlying commodity, to a 430 dlr level on\nthe first one for Citibank.\n    The premiums range from 22 pct to 36 pct and maturities\nfrom 18 months to four years and three months, in all cases\nlonger than gold futures and options on U.S. Markets.\n    The bankers traced the inspiration for the market back to\nthe February report of U.S. Consumer prices for January, when a\njump of 0.7 pct raised again the threat of inflation.\n    \"Many people are worried about inflation again,\" said Mats\nJoensson of Goldman Sachs. \"Money supply in Germany and the\nUnited States has grown very strongly in the last year and\npeople want to take a ride on gold.\"\n    The gold market, having seen strong gains in 1986, has\nlanguished just above 400 dlrs an ounce over the past few\nweeks. But the banks saw in warrants the vehicle for a more\nhighly leveraged play where the downside risk was limited.\n    Barrett said it was natural that the market developed in\nSwitzerland. \"People here understand gold, and they understand\nwarrants,\" he said.\n    Citicorp (Switzerland) pioneered warrants with a series of\nequity-linked covered issues based on Japanese company shares\nover the past two years, and last autumn, Swiss banks launched\ncovered warrants in Swiss registered shares in a bid to give\nforeign investors a chance to play in a market otherwise closed\nto all but Swiss citizens, and to play it with higher leverage.\n    But after a quick flurry of issues, that market dried up\nwhen Swiss shares prices fell from their January peaks.\n    The issues are being marketed not on the basis of simple\npremiums, but on implicit volatility models devised to provide\nscientific comparisons between titles in the options market.\n    Martin Bachem of Morgan Guaranty said his bank's issue was\ncompetitive despite its relatively high premium. The issue, for\nfive ounces at 425 dlrs, was priced at 955 Swiss francs, making\na premium over the spot gold price of nearly 36 pct.\n    Using a Black Sholes options model, he said the issue's\nlong, 4.3-year maturity meant the warrants needed an implicit\nvolatility of gold of only 24.5 pct for the option to pay off,\nwhich he claimed was lower than the other issues.\n    But Barrett said the Black Sholes variant Citicorp used\npointed to a higher volatily for the Morgan issue and\nemphasized that the models were at best an inexact science.\n    And each bank, using its own model, put the implicit\nvolatility needed for its own issue at close to 25 pct.\n    Whatever the calculation, the issues have received a warm\nwelcome from investors.\n    Joensson of Goldman Sachs said there was a lot of demand,\neven among small investors, who were buying 15 or 20 warrants\napiece. \"The most sophisticated ones wouldn't buy these because\nthe premiums are too high,\" he said.\n REUTER\n",

Its surplus rose to 8.14\nbillion dlrs in February from 5.7 billion dlrs in January.\n    Congress points to the record 169 billion dlrs U.S. trade\ndeficit in 1986 and the slow response in the trade imbalance to\nthe dollar's decline in world currency markets as a reason to\npress Japan to buy more U.S. goods.\n    They are particularly dismayed by the rapid deterioration\nin U.S. exports of sophisticated computer technology.\n    In response to the growing anger and pressure by the U.S.\nsemiconductor industry, President Reagan Friday announced he\nintended to raise tariffs as much as 300 mln dlrs on Japanese\nelectronic goods in retaliation for Japan's failure to abide by\na 1986 U.S.-Japanese semiconductor agreement.\n    Congress also has been been angered by the administration's\nlack of success with Japan on a host of other trade issues\nincluding beef, citrus, automobile parts, telecommunications\ngoods, and financial services.\n    The bulk of the House trade bill was written last week in\nfour committees. It is a package of trade sanctions and\nmeasures to force the administration take tough action against\nforeign trade barriers and unfair competition.\n    Although most provisions do not single out Japan, in many\ncases their impact would be to restrict imports of Japanese\nproducts or make them more expensive with higher duties.\n    The cornerstone of the trade legislation passed the House\nWays and Means Committee by a vote of 34 to 2. Its focus is to\nforce President Reagan to retaliate against unfair foreign\ncompetition and to make it easier for U.S. industries to win\ntemporary relief from surges in imports.\n    The most controversial issue, an amendment to restrict\nimports if countries such as Japan with large surpluses do not\nbuy more U.S. goods was left for an April vote by the House.\n    Rep. Richard Gephardt, a Democratic presidential aspirant\nfrom Missouri, has the support of Wright and other key\nDemocrats to press for passage of the amendment.\n    The measure would have the most impact on Japan, West\nGermany, Taiwan and South Korea. If Japan, for example, does\nnot reduce its barriers by mid-1988, the United States would\nset import quotas or tariffs to cut Japanese surplus by ten per\ncent a year for three years.\n    \"I'm tired of going into companies and having managers say\nto me, 'We're not over competing in Japan because we can't\ncompete in the marketplace.' That argument needs to be taken\naway from American business,\" Gephardt said.\n    The administration has said it could not support a trade\nbill containing such a provision.\n    \n",

But there is no\nway they can trade their way out of this situation,\" Aldo\nRoldan, Vice President for International Services at Chase\nEconometrics, said.\n    Roldan told Reuters that Brazil not only had to tackle the\nproblems of satisfying domestic demand and competing on glutted\nworld markets, but also had to work to make its position on\nforeign exchange markets more profitable.\n    \"Domestic costs have increased (due to inflation) and\nexporters have not had the same offsetting movement in exchange\nrates,\" Roldan said.\n    The Chase economist also said commodities markets were\ndepressed and generally did not appear very promising for a\ncountry like Brazil, where pure commodities account for some 50\npct of exports and in 1986 had a total value of around 23\nbillion dlrs.\n    But he added: \"They are always pretty aggressive and they\nhave good foreign marketing channels.\"\n    Analysts said a key factor in Brazilian trade will be\ncoffee, and even without background pressure from foreign\ncreditors the world's largest producer was expected to hit the\nmarket this year with a vengeance.\n    Negotiations between International Coffee Organization\n(ICO) members to re-establish producer export quotas broke up\nearlier this week with major producers and consumers accusing\neach other of intransigence.\n    \"Brazil would not tolerate a change in ICO regulations,\nwhich others wanted changed,\" one senior coffee dealer said.\n    The dealer, who declined to be named, said Brazil wanted to\npreserve its market share. At the end of the talks, he said\nBrazil hinted it could sell more than anyone else and others\nwould suffer.\n    Brazil will be an aggressive seller under any scenario but\nas yet there is no sign of unusually heavy Brazilian sales, the\ndealer said.\n    \"If they do come into the market at this level it will go\nlower and you could breach a dollar, ninety or eighty cents,\"\nhe said.\n    New York coffee futures for May delivery settled 2.29 cents\nlower Thursday at 104.68 cents a lb, while more distant\ndeliveries fell the six-cent maximum trading limit.\n    President of the Brazilian Coffee Institute, Jorio Dauster\ntold a press conference in Rio de Janeiro today that Brazil has\nno set target for its coffee exports following the breakdown of\nthe ICO talks on export quotas.\n    Many economists and analysts believe soybeans could be the\nfocus of possible stepped-up Brazilian marketing efforts. \"They\nwill be more aggressive this year than they have ever been,\"\naccording to Richard Loewy, analyst for Prudential-Bache\nSecurities Inc.\n    Loewy believes the foreign debt problem, a good crop, plus\ndifficulties with storage would help motivate selling of the\nBrazil soybean crop. \"Brazilian farmers also need cash flow and\nthey can't afford to store the crops,\" he said.\n    The Chicago soybean complex has been nervous for some time\nabout large South American crops developing under near ideal\nconditions towards record yields.\n    \"We are going to see a very rapid decline, earlier than\nusual, this year in our (U.S.) exports,\" Loewy said.\n    Tommy Eshleman, economist for the American Soybean\nAssociation (ASA), said this year's Brazilian soybean harvest\ncould total 18 mln tonnes, versus 13.7 mln last year.\n    Marketings will be very aggressive this summer when prices\nare usually high relative to the rest of the year due to the\nvulnerability of the U.S. crop to bad growing weather.\n    Another incentive to sell might be trade anticipation of a\nreduction in the U.S. government soybean loan rate, offered to\nfarmers who give crops as collateral, Eshleman said.\n    He said there has been some uncertainty this year about the\nsoybean loan rate, which acts as an effective floor for prices\nby keeping supplies away from the free market. Farmers can\nforfeit their beans to the government rather than repay the\nloan.\n    \"We're getting into a period when they (Brazil) are\nstarting to harvest and starting to export,\" Eshleman said. But\nhe added it will be a while before U.S. exports fall to below\n10 mln bushels a week from around 20 mln bushels currently.\n    Jose Melicias from the research department of Drexel\nBurnham Lambert said Brazil would be trying to export as much\nas it can this year because of its economic situation.\n    He said the debt situation was a major consideration. \"The\nBrazilian government also does not have enough money to pay for\nstorage,\" he added.\n    Asked if a return to an inflationary environment in Brazil\nwould make farmers inclined to hold onto crops, Melicias said\nit would not make a big difference.\n    On other commodity markets, Brazil's selling impact may be\nmuted no matter its need to generate capital.\n    Brazil is faced with a poor 1986/87 sugar harvest, which\ncould limit exports to the world market, analysts said. The\ncountry may have oversold and be unable to honor export\ncommitments, and this plus higher domestic demand caused by\nconsumer price subsidies on ethanol and refined sugar, will\ngive it little room to stretch exports, they said.\n    Brazil's other major crop, cocoa, is in its third year of\nsurplus. \"Cocoa consumption is basically flat and last year it\nfell, so I don't think they can start throwing out cocoa and\nfind many more markets for it,\" one analyst said.\n    \"If they come out as aggressive sellers, the market would\ncollapse and they can't afford to do that,\" she added.\n Reuter\n",

I don't believe Lawson is mad enough to tie\nhimself to a fixed rate,\" Brett said.\n    Currency markets were keen for official statements to\nclarify the scope of the Paris accord and reactivate currency\ntrading. This mood easily led to over-reaction, analysts said.\n    \"Making similar statements when the market is high strung\nand ready to bounce is perhaps a mistake,\" one senior dealer\nwith a U.S. Bank said.\n    Capel's Skeoch said, \"it gives the foreign exchange markets\nsomething to shoot at.\"\n    \"It is obvious that the government, as a member of the Group\nof Six, has agreed exchange rate bands. But they are not cut in\nstone, they can change with time,\" Skeoch said.\n    Brett said, \"we think the 2.90 marks level is a central\nrate. Give or take 10 pfennigs and all is fine.\"\n    Not all analysts played down the significance of the\nremarks, however. Chris Dunn, economist at Royal Bank of\nCanada, said the remarks may signal a decisive move to insulate\nsterling from the fortunes of the dollar.\n    Although about two-thirds of Britain's trade is conducted\nwith European countries, sterling has traditionally shadowed\nthe dollar rather than the mark, analysts noted.\n    \"Britain must decide whether it wants to follow the U.S. Or\nthrow in its lot with Europe,\" Dunn said.\n    \"It suggests that while the U.K. Is not actually applying to\njoin the European Monetary System, it is seeking protection by\nshadowing it ... The Bundesbank has made it clear that it wants\nthe U.K. To clarify its position relative to the mark,\" he said.\n    Analysts said sterling's dip on currency markets following\nLawson's remarks made an early half-point cut in U.K. Base\nrates from current 10 pct levels unlikely in the short term.\n    \"Over the next three weeks, a cut is out, unless we get some\nextremely good economic indicators,\" Capel's Skeoch said.\n    Base rates have been cut twice by one-half point in March,\nthe last after the March 17 budget presentation, and analysts\nhad been expecting another half point cut shortly afterwards.\n REUTER\n",

Japan's rice PSE was 68.8 pct compared to the EC\n13.6 and the U.S. 5.4 pct, the OECD calculations show.\n    In coarse grains, Japan's subsidies reached 107.1 pct\ncompared with 27.9 pct for the EC and 13.1 pct for the U.S.\nJapan's beef subsidy was 54.9 pct versus 52.7 pct for the EC\nand 9.5 pct for the U.S., OECD concluded.\n    For sugar, Japan's PSE was 48.4 pct versus 27.9 pct in the\nEC and 13.1 pct for the U.S., the study shows.\n    The OECD calculated farm subsidies for other industrial\ncountries such as Canada, Australia and New Zealand but in most\ncases the results were much lower than for the U.S., EC and\nJapan, the sources said.\n    Subsidies in Argentina and Brazil, two major developing\ncountry producers of commodities, were not included in the OECD\nwork.\n    Officials said they hope to persuade reluctant countries to\nrelease the study soon, perhaps coinciding with the OECD\nministerial meeting in Paris during May.\n    Some officials hope the OECD results will be used as a \nbasis for negotiations during the Uruguay round of global trade\ntalks now underway in Geneva.\n    British Agriculture Minister Michael Jopling during a visit\nto Washington this week endorsed the OECD work as a starting\npoint for the Uruguay round negotiations on agriculture.\n    He said the PSE calculations provide a tool to negotiate\ndown domestic farm support levels, which are a major cause of\nthe present crisis in world agriculture.\n    However, the OECD study results are controversial because\nthey highlight the levels of assistance to farmers, officials\nfamiliar with the study said.\n    The U.S. Agriculture Department's Economic Research Service\nrecently published a study of farm subsidies in an attempt to\nverify the OECD results and update them to 1982-84.\n    In some cases the results were substantially different than\nthe OECD's, in part because farm policies in both the U.S. and\nelsewhere had changed markedly by 1982-84 from the OECD base\nperiod of 1979-81, U.S. officials said.\n    For example, the USDA study found the United States\nsubsidies to corn producers were higher in 1982-84, at 25 to 49\npct, than in the EC, at zero to nine pct.\n    French Maize Producers Association president Marcel Cazale,\nciting the result of the USDA calculation for corn, told\nreporters last week that the United States subsidizes its\nfarmers more than the EC.\n    However, the sources said EC corn subsidies are probably\nhigher than the U.S. now because of increases since 1984.\n    Officials of several countries have been asked to\ncontribute data to OECD so that the study can be updated to\n1985 subsidy levels, a much more relevant measure of the\ncurrent world farm situation.\n    The updated calculations, which may take several months to\ncomplete, are expected to show substantial increases in U.S.\nsubsidy levels for sugar because the U.S. imposed restrictive\nimport quotas in 1982 as aid to the domestic industry.\n    U.S. subsidy levels also are increased by the 1985 farm\nbill, which sharply boosted government deficiency payments to\ngrain farmers and applied a marketing loan for rice, officials\nadded.\n Reuter\n",

Today's relatively stable oil\nprices of about 18 dlrs a barrel are not enough to spur a\nreturn to the heady days of 1981 when the U.S. drilling rig\ncount soared to a record high of more than 4,500 and oilfield\nroustabouts commanded premium wages.\n    The latest weekly Hughes Tool Co &lt;HT> rig count, a\nbarometer of the oil industry's health, showed 761 U.S. rigs\nactive in what is traditionally the slowest time of the year.\n    In 1986, the Hughes rig count began the year at 1,915 but\ndived to a post-World War II low of 663 in July as world oil\nprices experienced the sharpest decline in recent times.\n    Ike Kerridge, a Hughes economist, said \"In 1986, the United\nStates replaced only about 40 pct of the gas it used and that\nreplacement rate won't be any better this year.\"\n    He added, \"We don't have the options we do with oil.\nImports of gas from Canada are limited by pipeline capacity and\nimporting liquefied natural gas on ships will not be feasible\nin the next 10 years because of the cost.\"\n    Only about 6 trillion cubic feet of additional gas reserves\nwere discovered last year while U.S. consumption approached 16\ntrillion cubic feet, according to industry estimates.\n    George Gaspar, an oil analyst with Robert W. Baird and Co\nagreed that the need for gas supplies would set the stage for a\nnew cycle of gradual increases in U.S. drilling.\n    \"We anticipate that natural gas pipelines will need to\ndedicate to their systems new gas reserves for 1989 and 1990\nsupplies. That means new drilling programs must begin no later\nthan mid-1988,\" Gaspar said.\n    Gasper said he sees a new drilling cycle emerging that\ncould last until 1992 and that he expects the average rig count\nto peak near 2,000 in December of 1989.\n    Much of the search for new gas reserves is likely to be\nconducted in the offshore waters of the Gulf of Mexico, where\nfederal leases on unexplored areas will revert back to the\ngovernment unless drilling begins in the next two or three\nyears. Some of the industry's biggest companies, such as Exxon\nCorp &lt;XON>, Mobil Corp MOB, and Union Texas Petroleum have\nalready indicated plans to increase spending for drilling later\nthis year in the Gulf of Mexico, Crandall said.\n    For example, Conoco Inc, a Dupont &lt;DD> subsidiary, will\nspend 400 mln dlrs to build the Gulf of Mexico's deepest\nproduction platform, which will produce 50 mln cubic feet of\ngas per day.\n    But T. Boone Pickens, who has acquired huge Texas and\nKansas gas reserves for his Mesa Limited Partnership &lt;MLP> in\nrecent months, is not convinced that the drilling industry is\non the verge of a recovery.\n    Pickens predicts the U.S. rig count will soon drop below\n600 and will not increase significantly until oil prices do.\n    \"The rigs won't go back to work until the price of oil gets\nabove 30 dlrs a barrel,\" said Pickens, 58, adding he did not\nexpect to see the rig count top 2,000 again in his lifetime.\n    Tenneco Inc &lt;TGT>, one of the largest U.S. gas producers,\nis skeptical that a need for additional gas drilling exists.\n    Tenneco vice president Joe Foster said he did not expect\nsignificant increases in drilling for gas until the early 1990s\nwhen the U.S. gas reserves life will have declined to about\nseven years' supply. Current spot market prices of about 1.50\ndlrs per thousand cubic feet will need to rise to about three\ndlrs to spur reserve replacement, he said.\n Reuter\n",

World prices have been\nrecovering from the lows which followed the collapse of the ICO\ntalks and Brazil has sold a reasonable 5.5 mln bags of 60 kilos\nfor export in the first four months of this year.\n    The exporters said the key factor in the eventual opening\nof May and June export registrations will be the amount at\nwhich the contribution quota is set.\n    With little expectation of other sales incentive mechanisms\nsuch as discounts, bonuses and price fall guarantees being\nintroduced, the level of the quota will be decisive in\ndetermining the competitiveness of Brazilian coffee on world\nmarkets, they said.\n    They noted that on February 16, the eve of a planned\nincrease in the quota, April registrations were opened and\nclosed after 1.68 mln bags were registered for export, a record\namount for a single day.\n    If May/June registrations are opened under similar\nconditions as before, Brazil would have no difficulty in\nselling at least 2.0 mln bags per month.\n    \"The problem would be how to limit sales,\" one exporter said.\n    Brazil's present foreign trade and payments problems mean\nthere are pressures from the government to boost exports to\nmaximise foreign exchange earnings.\n    However, the sources said they expect the IBC to adopt a\nmarketing strategy aimed at regaining Brazil's dominant\nposition as an exporter, but without causing a price war.\n    General opinion among exporters was that Brazil would plan\nto export between 17 and 18 mln bags this year of which between\n1.5 and 2.0 mln would be to non-members of the ICO.\n    The 15.5 mln to 16 mln bags sold to members would be around\nthe figure Brazil had offered to ship if ICO quotas were\nreintroduced, although Dauster has said this offer expired with\nthe breakdown of talks.\n    With the prospects of a crop of at least 28 mln bags this\nyear, Brazil has the capacity to export up to 20 mln bags after\nmeeting local consumption of around 7.0 mln, the sources added.\n    However, the sources said Brazil is unlikely even to\nconsider exporting such quantities, as this would almost\ninevitably lead to a fall in world prices as Brazil tried to\nencroach on other producers' markets.\n    Maximum export earnings would be achieved by orderly\nmarketing of traditional amounts, thus re-establishing Brazil's\nmarket share after last year's unusually low exports of 9.9 mln\nbags, enabling it to rebuild stocks and maintaining cordial\nrelations with the producer group which backed Brazil's stance\nat the ICO talks, they added.\n Reuter\n",

Mining\nis monopolised by ZCCM and accounts for about 90 pct of the\ncountry's foreign exchange earnings.\n    Production has also been seriously affected in recent years\nby equipment breakdowns, deteriorating ore and shortages of\nspare parts, fuel and lubricants. The 463,354 tonnes output\nlast year compared with a peak 1975 output of 700,000 tonnes.\n    A five-year production and investment plan launched in 1984\nby ZCCM is being funded by the European Community, the African\nDevelopment Bank and the World Bank.\n    The plan foresees the shutdown of some seven mining and\nmetallurgical units on the grounds they are unprofitable.\n    ZCCM, the second largest employer after the government, has\nsaid it intends to lay off 20,000 of its 60,000 workforce as\npart of the plan.\n    More than 250 mln dlrs have so far been channelled into the\nindustry in a bid to improve efficiency and profitability under\nthe five-year restructuring plan.\n    Company officials said although reserves were being\ndepleted, Zambia could continue to produce copper beyond the\nend of the century, though at lower levels of production.\n    Industry sources said ZCCM's projected pre-tax profit for\nthe financial year ended March 31 would be around 500 mln\nkwacha. But with the current mineral export tax level being\nlevied, a net loss is likely to be registered.\n    ZCCM recorded a net loss of 718 mln kwacha in 1986 compared\nwith a net profit of 19 mln kwacha the year before.\n    Under the foreign exchange auction system introduced in\n1985, ZCCM's profits from its foreign exchange earnings rose as\nthe value of the kwacha fell to 21 to the dollar from just over\ntwo to the dollar.\n    But on May 1, President Kenneth Kaunda abolished the\nauctioning system, inspired by the International Monetary Fund,\nand announced Zambia would pursue a go-it-alone economic\nstrategy based on national resources.\n    ZCCM officials are still cautious over what effects the\nbreak with the IMF will have on the industry's plans.\n    \"We are still consulting to see how the new measures will\naffect us but it is too early to say just how we shall fare\nunder the new situation,\" Peter Hansen, director of operations\nand third in the ZCCM hierarchy, told Reuters.\n    Some analysts believe the new officially-fixed exchange\nrate of eight kwacha to the dollar will hit ZCCM's export\nprofits.\n    \"Most specialists I have talked to tell me the break-even\npoint for ZCCM is a rate of 10 kwacha per dollar,\" Frederick\nChiluba, leader of the Zambian Congress of Trade Unions said.\n    High production costs continue to bedevil the Zambian\nindustry.\n    Zambia mines copper at a relatively expensive rate of 69\ncents per pound, compared with 55 cents in the United States\nand under 40 cents in Chile.\n    The industry also faces transport problems due to Zambia\nbeing landlocked. The government confirmed this year it had\nstopped sBending copper south through South Africa.\n    Over 80 pct of shipments, some 35,000 tonnes a month, are\nsent by rail to the Tanzanian port of Dar-es-Salaam, while\n5,000 tonnes go via Zimbabwe to the Mozambique port of Beira.\nTransport has often been hit by shortages of wagons, spares and\nfuel.\n Reuter\n",

The buffer stock\nmanager is expected to begin buying cocoa within the next three\nweeks, after organizing communications with cocoa producing\ncountries and assessing the market, since prices are below the\n\"must-buy\" level of 1,600 Special Drawing Rights per tonne\nspecified in the agreement, the sources said.\n    The buffer stock theoretically has funds to buy a maximum\n100,000 tonnes within a five week period, but its approach will\nbe more cautious, buffer stock manager Juergen Plambeck said.\n    The buffer stock has around 250 mln dlrs in funds and a\nbuying limit of 250,000 tonnes of cocoa, 100,000 tonnes of\nwhich are already in the buffer stock.\n    ICCO council chairman and Ivorian Agriculture Minister\nDenis Bra Kanon said the new rules have a good chance of\nstabilizing prices. Ivory Coast is the world's largest cocoa\nproducer.\n    \"We have established rules which will permit us to withdraw\nimmediately the surplus of cocoa on the world market,\" Bra Kanon\ntold reporters after the council adjourned. Bra Kanon reckoned\nthe world cocoa surplus could be less than half the 94,000\ntonnes estimated by the ICCO statistics committee.\n    However, some producer and consumer members emerged from\nthe final ICCO council meeting with reservations about the\npact.\n    Ghana, whose high-quality cocoa is the world's most\nexpensive and provides 60 pct of the country's export earnings,\nmade a formal protest to the council about the price\ndifferentials assigned to its cocoa, saying they were too high\nfor Ghanaian cocoa to be bought for the buffer stock.\n    According to consumer spokesman Peter Baron of West\nGermany, \"Consumers weren't perfectly happy with the buffer\nstock rules. We reached a very sensitive compromise...There\nwere no real winners or losers.\"\n    Some European Community delegates were not satisfied that\nimportant points were fully discussed during the talks, and as\na result, doubted the rules can deal with world surpluses as\neffectively as they could have, delegates said.\n    Under the new rules, the buffer stock manager would seek\noffers of different origin cocoas, using price differentials to\nreflect different qualities. Non-ICCO member cocoa can comprise\nup to 15 pct of the total buffer stock.\n    London cocoa prices traded today around 1,300 stg per\ntonne, down from around 1,450 stg in January 1987 and 1,750 stg\nin January 1986.\n    A cocoa withholding scheme can take a further 120,000\ntonnes of cocoa off the market if a special council session\ndecides market conditions warrant it, according to the\nagreement.\n    The withholding scheme can only be used if prices fall\nbelow the 1,600 SDR lower intervention price for more than five\ndays and if 80 pct of the maximum buffer stock capacity has\nbeen filled, or if the buffer stock runs low on funds, it says.\n    The ICCO will discuss withholding scheme rules at an\nexecutive committee meeting on June 9/12, ICCO officials said.\n REUTER\n",

Dealers here will also want to\nsee how acceptable foreign metal will be on the new market and\nwhat sort of demand develops for forward deliveries.\n    There is also a view among European traders that, while the\nproposed Kuala Lumpur tin futures market would provide another\nuseful reference point, a market inaugurated by the Malaysian\ngovernment -- in the past viewed as a major player at times by\nthe trade -- would make participants uncomfortable.\n    Some traders expressed a preference for a resumption of\ntrading on the London Metal Exchange, but they added that while\nthere has been some behind the scenes discussion on the subject\na definite move is unlikely until outstanding High Court\nlitigation actions have been resolved.\n    Spot tin prices on the European free market are currently\naround 4,200 stg per tonne for high grade metal in warehouse\nRotterdam. Over the past 18 months the price moved to a ten\nyear low of 3,400 stg in March 1986 and rebounded to as high as\n4,680 stg in December 1986.\n    This compares with 8,140 stg last paid when LME trading\nceased in October 1985 and a record high tin price of 10,350\nstg traded for Cash Standard Grade metal in June of that year.\n    LME warehouse stocks are now near a two-year low at 28,065\ntonnes, having fallen steadily from a record high of 72,485\ntonnes reached in February 1986.\n    Traders said the free market turned bullish during late\nlast year based on producer forecasts of a supply/demand\ndeficit of some 28,000/29,000 tonnes. Analysts were predicting\nprices of up to 5,000 stg per tonne during 1987.\n    However, the trend was reversed following a strong upswing\nin sterling versus the dollar and values fell back briefly to\n4,100 stg last month after approaching 4,700 stg in December.\n    The decline accelerated as producers who had sold very\nlittle metal at the higher levels became competitive sellers.\n    There was also a lack of significant demand from major\nsteel mills who made large purchases prior to the new year.\n    Traders say the 15 ITC creditor banks' original tin\nholdings of nearly 45,000 tonnes have now been almost halved,\nand the bulk of material still available is being held by\nMalaysian and Japanese firms which are reluctant to depress the\nmarket with unwanted metal.\n    Some 80,000 tonnes were held by banks and brokers after the\nInternational Tin Council's, ITC, buffer stock manager halted\nsupport operations on the LME on behalf of the 22 members\nnations of the International Tin Agreement.\n    The overhang of metal was reduced further by broker\nShearson Lehman Brothers, which earlier this year reported\nhaving sold its ITC-related holdings and halved its overall tin\nposition.\n    Analysts see no immediate sign of a rally in European tin\nprices and movements are still expected to be largely related\nto currency fluctuations, unless significant consumer demand\nemerges for the third quarter.\n    The Association of Tin Producing Countries, ATPC, has made\nefforts since the collapse of the ITA to achieve higher world\nprices by attempting to bring all major producers under an\nexport control umbrella, but to date Brazil and China, two\nmajor producers, remain unaffected by the ATPC argument and\napparently are continuing to offer material at discounts to\nconsumers in main European trading centres, dealers said.\n Reuter\n",

It was estimated that if\noil fell to five dlrs a barrel it could trigger defaults that\ncould cost the government an estimated 15 billion dlrs.\n    - A five pct tax credit for exploration and development. It\nwould raise oil and gas production the equivalent of 325,000\nbarrels a day, at a cost of 740 mln dlrs a year.\n    - A five pct credit only for geological and geophysical\nexpenditures. It would increase production by 80,000 barrels a\nday, at a cost of 65 mln dlrs.\n    - Lower bid minimums on outer continental shelf acreage to\nspur exploration. A drop from the present 150 dlrs per acre for\nthe typical 5,760 acre tract to 25 dlrs per acre would lower\nthe cost of the standard tract lease to 144,000 dlrs.\n    Herrington also pressed anew for existing Administration\nproposals to deregulate natural gas, which he said would cut\nthe need for imported oil by 300,000 barrels daily.\n    He also called again for Congressional approval to explore\noff the continental shelf, which may hold more than 12 billion\nbarrels of oil, and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, which\nmay hold nine billion barrels.\n    Herrington said he understood the Reagan's reluctance to \namend the newly enacted tax code to fund some of these\nproposals, but added he hoped his department's energy/security\nstudy would make a strong case for the need to help the\nstruggling domestic oil industry.\n    Another move Herrington said he will press anew, even\nthough it had been rejected earlier by the White House, is to\nraise the fill-rate for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to\n100,000 barrels a day from its planned 1988 rate of 35,000.\n    This, he said, would further bolster national security in\ncase of an oil-supply disruption.\n   \n Reuter\n",

A Bank of Japan survey\nreleased last week showed that the decline in Japanese\ncorporate earnings may be nearing its end.\n    And the Paris currency accord last month has fostered hopes\nthe rapid yen rise has come to the end, they said.\n    Six nations - the U.K., Canada, France, Japan, the U.S. And\nWest Germany - pledged in Paris last month to stabilise\ncurrencies around current levels.\n    The yen's 40 pct climb against the dollar over the last two\nyears has hit the export-driven economy hard, by forcing its\ncompanies to raise prices and lose sales in the U.S. Market.\n    \"The important thing is the exchange rate,\" Taketomi said.\n    If it stabilises firms will grow more confident and raise\ninvestment in plant and equipment, although there are no signs\nof that yet, economists said.\n    A stable yen would also help exporters regain some of their\ncompetitive edge just as the U.S economy may be starting to\nrecover, economists said.\n    Domestically, the economy may get a boost from some\nloosening of the government's tight fiscal policy said Haruo\nMuto, manager of national economics at the Bank of Tokyo Ltd.\n    The next reading of the economy's health should come early\nnext week with the release of gnp figures for the last quarter,\n1986.\n    Most private economists expect a rise of about 0.5 pct from\nthe previous quarter. In the third quarter, GNP rose 0.6 pct.\n    But a senior government official said the fourth quarter\nfigures could surprise by showing a rise of more than one point\nquarter-on-quarter. But he added that would be a statistical\naberration and not a significant shift in economic activity.\n    To maintain year-on-year growth of around 2.5 pct, the\neconomy would have had to rise about 1.2 pct in the fourth\nquarter as the final quarter of 1985 was strong.\n     The rise in the fourth quarter of 1985 was probably a\nstatistical anomaly that was repeated in the final months of\n1986, the official said.\n    Economists said the fourth quarter figures were also\ndistorted by the government's sale of gold coins in the second\nhalf of 1986.\n    Because the coins were classified as legal tender, their\npurchase did not show up in the statistics on consumer\nexpenditure. Consumer spending also tailed off in December\nbecause of bad weather and smaller-than-normal end-year\nbonuses, they said.\n    As the government had to buy back some of the coins from\nretailers because they were unsold, the government's\ncontribution to the economy in the fourth quarter may have been\nboosted, economists said.\n    Taketomi said it may have received a further boost from\ngovernment buying of farm products as the domestic crop last\nyear was good.\n    The senior government official said the fourth quarter\nperformance of the domestic sector was probably worse than\ngenerally expected, while that of the external sector was\nbetter.\n REUTER\n",

What is happening is not yet\ngiving way to a pattern and so there is no reason to modify\nanything.\"\n    In 1985, the latest year for which full figures are\navailable, Central and South American nations produced 28 mln\ntonnes, raw value, of sugar of which 12.3 mln were exported. A\nyear earlier, they had produced and exported about 800,000\nmore, according to the London-based International Sugar\nOrganization.\n    Years of continuous low prices have plunged the sugar\nindustry in many countries in the region into a recession from\nwhich it will be hard to recover.\n    Miguel Guerrero, director of the Dominican Republic's\nNational Sugar Institute, said it would be difficult to boost\nproduction even if prices recovered sharply.\n    Output had slumped to under 450,000 tonnes a year from\n900,000 in the late 1970s. Obsolete refineries, poor transport\nand badly maintained plantations were barriers to any short\nterm recovery in output, he added.\n    Plans of nearby Cuba, the world's largest cane sugar\nexporter, to increase output to 10 mln tonnes a year by the end\nof the decade seem ambitious, trade sources said. Output is\nrunning well below the record 8.6 mln produced in 1970.\n    Cuba suffers from run down plantations, harvesting problems\nand poor processing facilities more than from low world prices,\nsince much of its output is sold to Eastern Bloc countries\nunder special deals. Last year, bad weather added to its\ntroubles, and output fell to 7.2 mln tonnes from 8.2 mln in\n1985.\n    The low world prices of recent years have led many\ncountries in the region to cut exportable production to levels\nwhere they barely cover U.S. And, in the case of some Caribbean\ncountries, European Community (EC) import quotas, for which\nthey receive prices well above free market levels.\n    Progressive reductions in the U.S. Quotas have led to\nproduction stagnating or falling rather than being shifted to\nthe free world market.\n    Peru, for example, shipped 96,000 tonnes to the U.S. In\nboth 1983 and 1984. This fell to 76,000 in 1986 and this year\nits quota is only 37,000.\n    A national cooperative official said that, as long as world\nmarket levels continue at around half of Peru's production\ncost, the future of the industry is uncertain.\n    At a meeting of GEPLACEA in Brazil last October officials\nstressed the need to find alternative uses for sugar cane\nwhich, according to the group's executive-secretary Eduardo\nLatorre, \"grows like a weed\" throughout the region.\n    Brazil, the largest cane producer with output of around 240\nmln tonnes, uses over half to produce alcohol fuel. Cane in\nexcess of internal demand for alcohol and sugar is refined into\nsugar for sale abroad to earn much needed foreign currency.\n    The difference in the price the state-run Sugar and Alcohol\nInstitute (IAA) pays local industry and what it receives from\nforeign buyers costs the government some 350 mln dlrs a year.\n    Soaring domestic demand for both alcohol and sugar over the\npast year, coupled with a drought-reduced cane crop, has meant\nBrazil will have difficulties in meeting export commitments in\n1987, trade sources said. Negotiations to delay shipments to\nnext year have been indecisive so far, the main sticking point\nbeing how Brazil should compensate buyers for non-delivery of\nsugar it had sold at around five cents per lb and which would\ncost eight cents to replace.\n    Brazilian sugar industry sources said new sugar export\nsales were expected to be extremely low for the next year, with\nthe Institute wary of exposing itself to domestic shortages of\neither alcohol or sugar and because of the need to rebuild\ndepleted reserve stockpiles.\n    However, the situation could change dramatically if the\neconomy goes into recession and internal demand slumps.\n    Sources within Latin America and the Caribbean hold little\nhope for the region's sugar industry to return to profitability\nunless the U.S. And EC change their policies.\n    \"The agricultural policies of the European Community and of\nthe United States have caused our economies incalculable harm\nby closing their markets, by price deterioration in\ninternational commerce and furthermore by the unfair\ncompetition in third countries,\" Brazil's Trade and Industry\nMinister Jose Hugo Castelo Branco told the October GEPLACEA\nmeeting.\n    The EC has come under prolonged attack from GEPLACEA for\nwhat the group charges is its continued dumping of excess\noutput on world markets. GEPLACEA officials say this is the\nmain cause of low prices.\n    GEPLACEA sees a new International Sugar Agreement which\nwould regulate prices as one of the few chances of pulling the\nregion's industry out of steady decline. Such an agreement\nwould have to have both U.S. And EC backing and industrialised\ncountries would have to see it as a political rather than a\nmerely economic pact.\n    \"They have to realise that the more our economies suffer,\nthe less capcity we have to buy their goods and repay the\nregion's 360 billion dollar foreign debt,\" GEPLACEA's Latorre\nsaid.\n Reuter\n",

Fekete said the rates would come into\neffect tomorrow.\n    He said one reason for the devaluation was that Hungary had\na higher rate of inflation over the past two years than its\nmain partners (around eight pct in 1985 and between five and\n5.5 pct in 1986).\n    This was partly an after-effect of action Hungary took to\nprevent inflation from soaring during the oil price shocks of\nthe 1970s, he added.\n    Hungary devalued by a similar amount last September and by\nbetween three and four pct early last year.\n    But the country's hard currency trade balance nevertheless\nfell into a deficit of 539.4 mln dlrs from a surplus of 295.3\nmln in 1986 and 1.2 billion in 1985.\n    Fekete said Hungary was hoping for a hard currency trade\nsurplus of between 200 and 300 mln dlrs this year, but that a\nmore likely outcome would be closer to equilibrium on total\nhard currency trade of around 10 billion dlrs.\n    One Western commercial attache here said: \"Devaluation of\nitself will not change anything. It will only be useful if they\nalso make efforts to restructure industry and improve the\nquality of their export goods.\"\n    Fekete said he hoped to raise credits on good terms this\nyear to invest in restructuring industry.\n    It would be his role to persuade international banks to\ncooperate in this process. He noted Hungary had been given an\nAA rating enabling it to raise money on the Japanese Samurai\nbond market.\n    Hungary's net hard currency debt soared to 7.79 billion\ndlrs last year from 5.01 billion in 1985, partly because of a\ncurrent account deficit of 1.42 billion dlrs and partly because\nthe fall in the dollar increased the dollar value of debt\ndenominated in marks or yen.\n    He said he feared net debt would also rise slightly this\nyear, but he was in favour of borrowing for the purpose of\nmodernisation.\n    \"I am for credits to invest for that purpose,\" he said. \"I am\nagainst credits for consumption.\" He forecast gross domestic\nproduct growth of two pct this year, from one pct in 1986.\n   Fekete said Hungary would continue to restructure its debt\nprofile by prepaying high interest shorter and medium term\nloans with cheaper long term money for which it was looking\nmore and more to the fixed interest rate bond market, where he\nconsidered rates to be low.\n    Hard currency foreign exchange reserves would stay at\naround 3.5 billion dlrs, he said. On the budget deficit, which\ntripled to a provisional 47 billion forints last year after\nquadrupling in 1985, Fekete said the finance ministry was\nworking out measures to reduce an approved target deficit for\nthis year of 43.8 billion forints to between 30 and 35 billion\nforints.\n REUTER\n",

The new INRA is to\nreplace the current one which expires in October.\n    Delegates at the renegotiation conference, held under the\nauspices of the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development\n(UNCTAD), reached agreement over the central elements of a new\naccord last weekend.\n    Xuto said the new INRA retains the reference price -- of\n201.66 Malaysian/Singapore cents per kilo -- and indicative\nprices set in the present pact.\n    Price levels will continue to be expressed in the joint\nMalaysian/Singapore currency, he added.\n    The new agreement also maintains the basic structure of\nprice ranges -- the \"may sell\" and \"may buy\" points at plus and\nminus 15 pct of the reference price, as well as the \"must sell\"\nand \"must buy\" zones at plus and minus 20 pct of it.\n    Xuto said the new pact maintains the same objectives that\nwere set in the present accord. \"The most important of these are\nto stabilise prices and to achieve a balanced growth between\ndemand and supply,\" he said. The buffer stock remains the sole\ninstrument of market intervention for price stabilisation and\nits maximum capacity is unchanged at 550,000 tonnes, Xuto\nadded.\n    At this month's session, which was the fourth attempt in\ntwo years to negotiate a new INRA, the main issue to be\nresolved concerned the mechanism for adjusting the reference\nprice.\n    It was agreed to conduct reviews of the reference price\nevery 15 months -- instead of the current 18-month intervals.\n    The extent of the adjustment was also modified.\n    Under the present agreement if the daily market indicator\nprice has been above the upper intervention (\"may sell\") price\n(currently 231 Malaysian/Singapore cents) or below the lower\nintervention price (\"may buy\") price (171 cents at present) for\nsix months, the reference price is then revised by five pct or\nwhatever amount the International Natural Rubber Council\ndecides.\n    Under the new pact, the adjustment under these\ncircumstances will be five pct unless the Council decides on a\nhigher adjustment.\n    Similarly, when buffer stock purchases or sales amount to\n300,000 tonnes, there would be an automatic adjustment of three\npct under the new accord unless the Council decides on a higher\npercentage.\n    Throughout the talks, which began on March 9, producers had\nstrongly opposed a consumer proposal to lower the reference\nprice and the \"lower indicative price\" (or floor price) of 150\ncents in the present pact if the buffer stock, currently\n360,000 tonnes, reached 450,000 tonnes.\n    The proposal, initiated by the U.S., was withdrawn last\nFriday, setting the stage for compromise at the weekend.\n    Since then negotiators have worked on the finer details of\nthe new pact.\n    On the question of conditions for entry into force of the\nnew INRA, Xuto said it was tentatively agreed that governments\naccounting for 75 pct of world exports and 75 pct of world\nimports approved or ratified the new agreement before it became\noperational.\n    The present agreement had a figure of 80 pct.\n Reuter\n",

A company spokesman said the\ndata were provided by economic consultants to USX.\n    The primary reason for the trade imbalance was the 70 pct\nrise of the dollar between 1980 and 1985, although other\nfactors were involved, Roderick said. But it is wrong, he said,\n\"to attribute the massive trade deficit to a fundmental\ndeterioration of U.S. productivity or of American product\nquality.\"\n    These areas need to be improved but they are not the root\ncause of the trade gap problem, Roderick said. He urged\nAmerican manufacturers to become more competitive so they can\ncompete in global markets.\n    In the speech, the USX chairman also called for changes in\nsecurities laws to curb what he called abuses by corporate\nraiders and speculators.\n    Among his proposals, which he presented to the Senate\nBanking Committee in testimony last week, were a requirement\nthat raiders give 24-hour notice for every one pct of stock\nthey acquire in a company.\n    Roderick proposed that tender offers must be made for all\ncash to all stockholders on equal terms and that raiders be\nrequired to have financing in place before a tender is made.\n    Further, raiders should be required to make an all-cash\ntender offer once they acquire 10 pct of a target company's\nstock, he said. And payment of greenmail, or a preferential\nprice by a target company to buy back a raider's stake, should\nbe prohibited under the revised laws.\n    Roderick said changes were necessary to curb abuses but\nthat he did not want laws that would hurt the financial markets\nor discourage \"fair price to all\" takeovers.\n Reuter\n",

That distaste stems in part from fears of recession.\n    Outgoing Deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman told\ntelevision interviewers he did not think a policy of driving\nthe dollar down would solve the U.S. trade deficit.\n    \"It would slow growth in Germany and Japan which would\nadversely affect our trade balance and ultimately it would\ndrive interest rates up here which would throw us, if not\n(into) recession, into slower growth,\" he said.\n    Asked if higher U.S. Interest rates would stabilize the\ndollar, Balladur said: \"When a currency is maintained\nartificially high, by artificially high interest rates, it is\nnot healthy.\"\n    And resorting to higher interest rates could lead to\nrecession, he said.\n    Acknowledging the dollar's latest slide was now a fact of\nlife, Balladur said, \"there may be adjustments of course in one\nor other currencies, this is not a fixed rate system.\"\n    But Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker said he\nmight rein in credit if the dollar's slide deepens.\n    U.S. Monetary sources also said Washington wanted it\nunderstood by markets the seven's commitments were genuine.\n    \"The United States and the six major industrial countries\nare fully committed to implementing our undertakings in these\nagreements,\" Baker told the meetings.\n    Darman said Baker had been misinterpreted by markets which\nwrongly believed earlier remarks suggested he wanted a further\ndecline in the dollar. Baker, Darman said, was committed to\nstabilizing currencies at current levels.\n    Last week's statement from the seven reaffirmed a February\n22 agreement in Paris in which the Reagan administration agreed\nto reach a budget deficit compromise with Congress and to fight\nprotectionism.\n    West Germany and Japan, meanwhile, agreed to stimulate\ndomestic demand and lead a global upturn.\n    Ministers believed the Paris pact was bolstered by Japan's\npromise of a 35 billion dlr supplementary budget.\n    The sources said they believed Baker saw it as a major\naction. But the seven seem to accept their commitment to stable\ncurrencies applied to today's exchange rates and not those at\nthe time of the Paris agreement, when the dollar stood higher.\n    The Paris accord said, \"currencies (are) within ranges\nbroadly consistent with underlying economic fundamentals, given\nthe policy commitments summarized in this statement.\"\n    Now they accept the dollar's lower level, especially\nagainst the yen, as hard reality that is nonetheless consistent\nwith the agreement. \"The ministers and governors reaffirmed the\nview that around current levels their currencies are within\nranges broadly consistent with fundamentals,\" last week's\nstatement read.\n    Monetary sources said policymakers understood markets were\nfocusing on instability created by the gap between the U.S.\nTrade deficit and the surpluses of West Germany and Japan\nrather than prospective policy changes.

The upper reaches of the\nYangtze are at their lowest levels in a century, causing many\nships to run aground, Wen Wei Po said.\n    Unusually high temperatures have also been reported across\nChina, media reports said.

The year's secondary rains usually\noccur between April and June, although it is not possible at\nthis stage to forecast whether they will arrive as usual.\n REUTER\n",

It may be a shame,\nbut we are locked into this,\" said Dan Glickman, (D-Kans.),\nchairman of the subcommittee on wheat, soybeans and feed\ngrains. \"We need to look at ways to cut costs and not hurt the\nfarmer. A 0/92 plan, if properly done, could do both.\"\n    Glickman announced this week plans to introduce a 0/92 bill\nfor 1987 and 1988 wheat and feedgrains. An aide to Glickman\nsaid that it will probably be introduced next week.\n    Glickman said a 0/92 program, which allows a farmer to\nforego planting and still receive 92 pct of his deficiency\npayment, would not be a major revision of the 1985 farm bill --\nonly an extension of the 50/92 option already provided under\nthe current bill.\n    It is premature to make any major changes in the farm bill,\nhe said, but if agriculture has to make further cuts to meet\nbudget goals, a voluntary 0/92 plan would be better than\nsharply cutting target prices, as USDA has proposed.\n    A 0/92 plan, however, would not be decoupling, but simply a\ndifferent type of acreage diversion program, Glickman said.\n    Decoupling -- delinking planting decisions from government\npayments -- is too much of a policy change to approve at this\npoint, he said.\n    \"I don't think there is any interest in pursuing a\ndecoupling bill this year. Period. Unequivocal,\" Glickman said\nat the hearing.\n    Sen. Rudy Boschwitz (R-Minn.), cosponsor of the\nBoren/Boschwitz decoupling plan, said he supports a short term\n0/92 program as a move to a more permament decoupling plan.\n    Boschwitz plans to introduce a 0/92 plan in the senate. His\nplan would guarantee a certain deficiency payment to\nparticipating farmers, require that idled acreage be put to\nconservation use only, prohibit haying and grazing on extra\nidled acreage, limit participation to a certain number of acres\nin a county and provide tenant protection provisions.\n    \"I know we cannot obtain complete decoupling in 1987, but\nwe can at least move in that direction,\" Boschwitz said.\n    Robbin Johnson, vice president of Cargill, Inc., testified\nin favor of decoupling. Decoupling would end the current bias\nin U.S. farm policy towards overproduction and reduce farmers'\ndependency on the government, he said.\n    A 0/92 plan does not go far enough in decoupling, Johnson\nsaid, and would still encourage farmers to plant.\n    Officials from the National Corn Growers Association and\nthe National Cattlemen's Association said their groups oppose\nany 0/92 or decoupling plan due to concerns about reopening the\nfarm bill and creating more confusion among farmers.\n    But when asked if his association were forced to choose\nbetween a ten pct cut in target prices or a 0/92 program, Larry\nJohnson of the Corn Growers said they would agree to 0/92\nrather than take sharp cuts in target levels.\n Reuter\n",

But January's\nsales were revised down to a 7.4 pct drop, from a previously\nreported 5.8 pct decline.\n    \"The trend is toward continued spending but certainly at a\nmuch more sluggish pace,\" said Don Maude of Midland Montagu\nCapital Markets Inc.\n    Maude averaged out the wide swings in the retail sales data\nover past four months to show that the pace of consumer\nspending is slowing.\n    Combining the latest data with a 0.6 pct drop in November\nand a 4.6 pct gain in December, the average retail sales gain\nover the four months was 0.2 pct, he said, compared to to a 0.4\npct rise for year-over-year sales through February.\n    \"You can see a pattern developing,\" Maude said. \"I wouldn't\nbe surprised to see a fall-off in March, especially since sales\nprobably won't be boosted by auto sales as they were in\nFebruary.\"\n    Despite the weak underlying trend, economists were\nimpressed by a robust 1.5 pct gain in total sales excluding\nautos in February. This compared to a revised 0.4 pct decline\nin January, previously reported as a 0.1 pct decline.\n    \"The increase in non-auto sales was broadbased, with gains\nin durable goods as well as non-durables,\" noted Ward McCarthy\nof Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc. \"It was a pretty healthy\nreport.\"\n    He noted that building materials rose 1.8 pct in February\nafter falling 1.7 pct in January.

This followed a 27.7 pct drop\nin January, previously reported as a 22.4 pct fall, due largely\nto the expiration of the sales tax deduction under new tax laws\nJanuary 1, the Commerce Department noted.\n    Some economists argued that the because the gain in total\nsales excluding autos also followed a decline in January, the\nstrength in the February report is less than impressive.\n    \"There is strength in the February data, but that's because\nthey were compared to low sales levels in January,\" said said\nBeth Reiners of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. \"We don't see it as a\nprecursor of continued strength.\"\n    Durable goods sales rose 8.8 pct in February, after falling\n17.7 pct in January. February non-durable goods sales gained\n1.3 pct, after declining 0.2 pct in January.\n    Gasoline service station sales rose two pct in February,\nfollowing a 1.9 pct gain in January, but economists said higher\noil prices rather than an increased volume of gas sales\nprobably accounted for these gains.\n    Reiners also emphasized that the trend in consumer spending\nis weakening. Total retail sales on average were 123 billion\ndlrs in the fourth quarter of 1986, she said. In January, they\nfell to a seasonally adjusted 117.52 bilion dlrs, and in\nFebruary rose to 122.29 billion dlrs.\n    \"On average, it looks like they'll total 120 to 121 mln\ndlrs in the first quartrer,\" she said. \"We don't look at this\nas indication that the economy is barrelling along.\"\n    \"The number is not really that problematic for those of us\nwho are constructive on the bond market,\" agreed Elliot Platt\nof Donaldsen Lufkin and Jenrette Securities Corp.\n    Platt does not foresee potential for tighter monetary\npolicy on the basis of the latest retail sales report.\n    \"The Fed is on hold now because the data have been so\nconfusing,\" he said.\n    \"Before the 337,000 gain in February non-farm payroll\nemployment, I would have looked for a discount rate cut in\nMarch,\" he said. \"But now Fed officials will have to wait for\nthe first quarter real U.S. gross national product data in\nApril to sort things out.\"\n Reuter\n",

He\nannounced after his meeting that Chirac had told him the\ngovernment would spend two billion francs on a series of\nmeasures to boost employment and training\n    Andre Bergeron, a widely respected leader of the moderate\nForce Ouvriere labour group, put similar demands to Chirac\nearlier in the week while the Communist-led CGT, the largest of\nFrance's unions, declared the defence of its members earnings\nits top priority.\n    But with unemployment nearing 11 per cent last month, and\nstill rising, government supporters and some economic analysts\nsaid they were confident Chirac could resist union pay demands.\n    \"Salary indexation was ended by the previous Socialist\ngovernment and I dont think this administration is going to\nreverse that,\" commented Michel Develle, economist at\nrecently-privatised Banque Paribas.\n    Damaging transport and electricity strikes over Christmas\nand the New Year, partly blamed by the government for higher\ninflation, had undermined the unions power and popularity, he\nsaid.\n    Develle said Paribas expected inflation to rise even more\nthan the governments revised forecast, perhaps to 2.6 or 2.7\nper cent this year against last years 2.1 per cent.\n    \"But that would still be an exceptional achievement\nconsidering that for the first time since the Second World War\nall french prices have been freed,\" he commented.\n    Finance Ministry officials said that the governments\nabolition of price and rent controls last year was responsible\nfor nearly a quarter of a 0.9 per cent surge in January living\ncosts.\n    But they claimed it was a once-off phenomenon that should\nhave no knock-on impact on the rest of the year.\n    Both Marais and Develle said they agreed with that, so long\nas the government kept wages under control.\n    Prices could rise 1.5 per cent in the first three months of\n1987 and two per cent in the first half year, fractionally more\nthan forecast this week by the National Statistics Institute,\nINSEE,  Marais said. But the second half year should be better,\nhe added.\n    Ironically, one side effect of higher inflation could be to\nhelp the government achieve its aim of cutting the state budget\ndeficit, several analysts said.\n    So long as public sector wages are held down, higher Value\nAdded Tax receipts resulting from rising prices should offset a\nloss in revenues that otherwise would result from slower than\nexpected growth, they said.\n   \n Reuter\n",

The ministry had previously put the January\nand December indices at 101.6 and 104.7 respectively.\n    In February 1986 the output index had stood at 103.7,\nproducing a year-on-year rise for February 1987 of 0.4 pct.\n    The February rise in production was aided by a sharp 19 pct\nincrease in construction output compared with January, when\nproduction in many industrial sectors was depressed by\nunusually severe winter weather.\n    Manufacturing industry registered a 3-1/2 pct rise in\nproduction in February compared with January. But energy sector\noutput fell nine pct and mining production declined seven pct.\n    The ministry, which considers two-monthly comparisons to be\na better guide to trends, said output in January and February\ntogether fell around two pct against November and December.\n    The ministry said construction output fell 13-1/2 pct in\nJanuary/February against November/December due to the cold\nJanuary weather. Output in the energy sector rose four pct and\nmining output 10 pct.\n    Manufacturing industry's production fell 1-1/2 pct in\nJanuary/February compared with November/December.\n    Within this sector, the output of both basic products and\nof food, tobacco and alcohol fell 1-1/2 pct.

The agreement\nsimply helped it on its way. Senior EC financial expert in\nTokyo Tomas de Hora has watched the movements closely.\n    \"You have to look at the dollar's peak compared with now,\nand that was well before Plaza,\" he said.\n    On February 25, 1985, the dollar peaked against the yen at\n263.15 yen. On September 20, the Friday before Plaza, it was\n242. Since then, despite massive Bank of Japan intervention and\nperiodic market frights about further G-5 concerted action, the\ndollar trend has been down, down, down.\n    Yet the ECU is now around 173.4 yen. The historical cross\nrates for sterling and the mark tell much the same story. The\nEuropean currencies are moving back up against the yen.\n    The close relationship between exchange rates and trade\nflows makes it difficult to see which is driving which, but\nundoubtedly the trade equation between the big three is\nchanging. In 1986, Japanese imports and exports with the EC\nboth grew by around 50 pct in dollar terms, five pct in yen.\nThis gave Japan a 16 billion dlr trade surplus.\n    Last January, Japanese exports to the EC totalled half of\nof sales to the U.S, against about a third in recent years.\n    Trade with the U.S in 1986 rose 23 pct for exports and 12\npct for imports in dollar terms, but fell 13 pct for exports\nand 21 pct for imports in yen terms.\n    \"The basic meaning for Europe is that Japanese firms have a\ntremendous interest in exporting to Europe, where every unit\nsold maximises profits in yen terms, which is what is important\nto them. Suddenly, instead of the U.S., It is Europe that is\nlaying the golden egg,\" said de Hora.\n    The EC is worried. EC business also had a remarkable year\nin Japanese sales, but this can be explained partly due to its\nstart from a small base, compared with total Japan-U.S. Trade.\n    The Japanese think EC firms are now more competitive than\nU.S. Firms, a factor which is aggravating the exchange rate\nimbalance, and which will cause problems.\n    \"This currency alignment between Japan and the EC is\nreflecting the excellent performance of the EC countries. But\ntherefore, Japanese goods may keep their price competitive\nedge,\" said Azusa Hayashi, Director of the First International\nEconomic Affairs Division of the Foreign Ministry. \"If you want\nmy objective view, I don't expect a drastic improvement in our\ntrade imbalance. Last year, we asked for moderation in exports,\nand this year we may have to do so again,\" he said.\n REUTER\n",

It recommended that to stop friction\ndue to its large trade surpluses, Japan must \"make a historical\ntransformation in its traditional policies on economic\nmanagement and the nation's lifestyle. There can be no further\ndevelopment for Japan without this transformation.\"\n    Americans and Europeans took the report to heart and have\nlooked in vain for clear signs of this historic change. But the\nJapanese remain doubtful about the short, or even medium term\nprospects of totally transforming their economic habits.\n    The bubble of frustration against what appears as Japanese\nprevarication burst last week. The U.S. Said it intended to\nraise tariffs of as much as 300 mln dlrs on Japanese exports to\nthe U.S. On the grounds Japan had abrogated a bilateral\nsemiconductor pact.\n    British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher threatened to\nblock Japanese financial firms from London after the Japanese\nplaced what the British say are restrictive conditions on a bid\nby British firm Cable and Wireless to join a domestic\ntelecommunications joint venture.\n    On Friday, European currency dealers said European central\nbanks, annoyed at restrictive Japanese trade practises, might\nleave Japan alone to intervene to staunch the rise of the yen.\n    Eishiro Saito, head of top Japanese business group\nKeidanren, spotted the dangers inherent in such contradictory\nviews last November when he visited the European Community.\n\"Related to this matter of (trade) imbalance, the point that I\nfound to be of great cause for alarm during this trip to Europe\nwas the excessive degree of hope placed by the Europeans in the\nresults of the Maekawa report,\" he said.\n    \"We explained that the process of restructuring the economy\naway from its dependence on exports toward a balance between\ndomestic and external demand...Would take time,\" Saito said.\n    Saito's words were ignored. In February, EC Industrial\nPolicy Director Heinrich von Moltke came to Japan and said \"I\nonly know that your government, under the leadership of\nMaekawa, points to restructuring your economy into a less\noutward looking, more inward looking one. It is the Maekawa\nreport which has attracted the most attention in Europe.\"\n    And Europeans and Americans want quick action. \"A far better\nanswer than protectionism would be structural change within the\nJapanese economy, the kind suggested by the Maekawa report. And\nwe hope to see changes occur in the near future,\" visiting\nChairman of General Motors Roger Smith said in March.\n    Such expectations are now ingrained, which was partly the\nfault of Nakasone, who heralded Maekawa's report as a sea of\nchange in Japanese affairs, said U.S. Officials.\n    Months before the report was issued, U.S. And EC business\nleaders met their Japanese colleagues to discuss the trade\nproblem.\n    \"We are more anxious than ever that the new approach of the\nMaekawa committee does lead to speedy and effective action,\"\nsaid EC Industrial Union leader Lord Ray Pennock.\n    \"The important implication of the Maekawa report is that it\nis finally looking to let Japanese enjoy the fruits of their\nlabour,\" said Philip Caldwell, Senior Managing Director of\nShearson Lehman Brothers.\n    Contents of the report were leaded well ahead of issuance.\n    Japanese officials say they are implementing the report as\nfast as they can, said a European ambassador who has travelled\nthe country asking about this issue.\n    He said People mentioned many things in line with the\nspirit of the report, including restructuring of the coal and\nsteel industries.\n    A major misunderstanding is that the private report was\ngovernment policy. Europeans are confused about this,\nunderlined by von Moltke's reference to the \"leadership\" of the\nMaekawa report. Even so, Japanese officials point to last\nSeptember's government programme of new economic measures.\n\"Without endorsing the report as policy, officials point out\nthat the government has put its signature to a programme\ndesigned to implement the report,\" the ambassador said.\n REUTER\n",

This week, many\nof the same experts gather in the same building here to try to\nagree on how the cocoa pact reached last summer should work.\n    The still unresolved legal wrangle surrounding the\nInternational Tin Council (ITC), which had buffer stock losses\nrunning into hundreds of millions of sterling, is also casting\na shadow over commodity negotiations.\n    The ITC's failure has restricted negotiators' ability to\ncompromise as governments do not want to be involved in pacts\nwith built-in flaws or unlimited liability, but want clear\nlines drawn between aid and trade.\n    A more hopeful sign of cooperation was agreement on basic\nelements of a new International Natural Rubber Agreement in\nGeneva at the weekend.\n    Some importing countries insist the International Cocoa\nOrganization (ICCO) buffer stock rules must not be muddied with\nquota type subclauses which might dictate the type of cocoa to\nbe bought. One consumer country delegate said this would\n\"distort, not support\" the market.\n    Trade and industry sources blame uncertainty about the ICCO\nfor destabilising the market as the recent collapse in coffee\nprices has made traders acutely aware that commodity pacts can\nfounder. On Friday this uncertainty helped push London cocoa\nfutures down to eight month lows. The strength of sterling has\nalso contributed to the recent slip in prices.\n    The ICCO daily and average prices on Friday fell below the\n\"must buy\" level of 1,600 SDRs a tonne designated in the pact,\nwhich came into force at the last ICCO session in January but\nwithout rules for the operation of the buffer stock.\n    Consumers and producers could not agree on how it should\noperate and what discretion it should be given. The agreement\nlimits it to trading physical cocoa and expressly says it\ncannot operate on futures markets.\n    A cash balance of some 250 mln dlrs and a stock of almost\n100,000 tonnes of cocoa, enough to mount large buying or\nselling operations, were carried forward from the previous\nagreement.\n    Members finance the stock through a 45 dlrs a tonne levy on\nall cocoa they trade. It has an upper limit of 250,000 tonnes.\n    The key arguments being faced by the ICCO working group on\nbuffer stock rules which is meeting today and tomorrow will be\nover non-member cocoa and differentials the buffer stock should\npay when trading different types of cocoa. Another working\ngroup is scheduled to meet Wednesday to discuss administrative\nmatters, and the full council meets on Thursday.\n    Producers have so far maintained that buffer stock funds\nshould not help mop up surplus cocoa produced in non-member\ncountries such as Malaysia.\n    Consumers say when this cocoa is the cheapest the buffer\nstock should buy it rather than compete with chocolate\nmanufacturers for premium-priced high quality cocoas.\n    The argument over buying non-member cocoa is closely linked\nto the one over differentials for different qualities.\n    European industry and trade advisers have suggested as a\ncompromise that the buffer stock have a maximum share that can\nrepresent non-member cocoa and that it use the London futures\nmarket's existing differentials for different qualities.\n    Currently, good West African cocoa is tendered at par onto\nthe London market.\n    Discounts, which are currently under review, range up to 50\nstg a tonne for Brazilian and Malaysian cocoa.\n    Consumer delegates said the same arguments in reverse would\noperate when prices are high - the buffer stock should sell the\nhighest priced cocoa in most demand, forcing all prices lower.\n    The January talks were slowed by a split inside the\nEuropean Community, a key ICCO consumer group, with France\nsiding with producers. EC representatives met in closed session\nin Brussels on Friday in an attempt to reach a common ground\nand, a diplomatic source said, narrowed the range of positions\namong the 12 nations.\n    The source said the EC will be looking for signs of\nflexibility on the part of producers in the next few days and\nwill be able to respond if they are there.\n    One ICCO delegate describing the producer/consumer split\nsaid consumer proposals mean buying more cocoa for less and\nbacks the concept of the pact which is \"meant to support the\nmarket where trade buying is not.\"\n    In contrast, he said, producers seem to want to sell their\ncocoa to the buffer stock rather than consumers.\n    Other, more technical, issues still outstanding include\nwhether the buffer stock should buy at a single announced\n\"posted price\" as in the previous pact or by announcing it is\nbuying then accepting offers.\n    In either case, delegates said, it is accepted that\nproducers must be given a clear opportunity to make offers of\ncocoa for forward shipment directly to the buffer stock in a\nway that is competitive with spot offers made by dealers.\n REUTER\n",

But economists said that\nseasonal factors make it hard to assess what spur to the\neconomy, if any, will come from housing in coming months. And\nafter a steady retreat, mortgage rates seem to be near bottom.\n    U.S. housing starts rose 2.6 pct in February to a\nseasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.851 mln units from 1.804\nmln in January. It was the highest pace for starts since April\n1986.\n    The rate at which permits were issued for future building\nclimbed 4.4 pct to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.764\nmln units after dropping 11.52 pct to 1.690 mln in January.\n    \"February's weather is usually more adverse for home\nbuilding. Because of seasonal factors it's difficult to\ndetermine what this means for the economy down the road,\" said\nAllan Leslie of Discount Corp.\n    The housing report is seasonally-weighted to compensate for\nweather-related setbacks. As a result, milder temperatures\ninflate the statistics.\n    Economists said that low mortgage rates also were a spur to\nbuilding last month. But several believe that rates will now\nconsolidate before edging up in late spring/early summer.\n    \"Builders are looking at current mortgage rates and saying\n'Let's do it now',\" said Mark Obrinsky of the U.S. League of\nSavings Institutions in Washington, whose members supply much\nof the financing for home building.\n    But Obrinsky doubts that there is much more downward\npotential for rates because he foresees higher inflation and \nsome overall improvement in the U.S. economy.\n    He expects rates to gain 50 to 100 basis points in early\nsummer from the 9.50 pct fixed rate effective in February. Last\nNovember, fixed rate mortgages were about 10.30 pct.\n    As expected, the strength in housing was concentrated in\nthe single-family sector. The multi-family area -- which\ntypically represents rental units -- remained weak due to high\nvacancy rates and increased capital costs of such units\nfollowing tax law changes effective January 1.\n    Single-family starts rose at a 5.6 pct annual pace to 1.317\nmln units. Multi-family fell 4.1 pct to a 534,000 rate.\n    \"Strength in the single-family sector indicates that low\nmortgage rates are doing their job. But we're probably not\nlooking at a great deal of growth potential,\" said Ward\nMcCarthy of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.\n    McCarthy noted that the housing report, together with\nlarger than expected gains in U.S. employment, industrial\noutput and retail sales in February, may cause some observers\nto start waving \"four pct GNP banners\" for the first quarter.\nGross national product grew 1.3 pct in the fourth quarter.\n    But McCarthy, who still expects first quarter real GNP to\ncome in at an annual rate of 2.5 pct or slightly above, is not\nconvinced that growth will pick up in future.\n    \"The big story is the inventory re-building that's going on\nnow, not all of which is intentional,\" he said. For example,\nU.S. automakers, who are already saddled with high stocks,\nproduced at an annual rate of 8.3 mln units in February\ncompared with domestic car sales of 7.3 mln.\n    Thus while inventories could contribute to GNP in the first\nquarter, they may result in scaled-back production and weaker\ngrowth in the second, he said.\n    \"If most of the first quarter growth is inventory building\nand we cannot identify any improvement in export demand, then\nthere is the potential for softness in the second quarter,\"\nagreed Allan Leslie of Discount Corp. He is still evaluating\nfirst quarter GNP prospects.\n    Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker said last week that\ncurrent data do not show the worsening in trade has reversed.\n    \"At the same time that we are pumping up inventories in the\nfirst quarter, we could foresee production slowing in the\nsecond,\" cautioned Joe Plocek of McCarthy, Crisanti and Maffei\nInc, who expects first quarter growth of about three pct.\n Reuter\n",

By January, its estimate of 1986\nplanted acreage nationwide was 10.06 mln.\n    Analysts said their forecasts for even greater acreage in\n1987 were spurred in part by belief that this year's good\ndemand and firm prices will be repeated next year. Analysts\nsaid those factors make cotton a profitable crop.\n    \"With cotton more attractive price-wise, I think there is\ngoing to be a switch in acreage from soybeans to cotton.\nSoybeans are dirt cheap,\" said Lisbeth Keefe of Cargill\nInvestor Services, whose comments were echoed by other cotton\nmarket specialists.\n    Changes in the U.S. cotton program also could lead to\nincreased acreage, analysts said.\n    They recalled that under the 1986 program, cotton farmers\nwho used part of their crop as collateral for government loans\nwere not responsible for the cost of storing that cotton in\ngovernment warehouses. But under the 1987 plan, the government\nwill not pick up the tab for storage.\n    Analysts said the change will discourage some farmers from\nparticipating in the program, which could result in more\ncotton. \"The cotton program stipulates a mandatory set-aside of\n25 pct of a farmer's base acreage,\" noted Judy Weissman of\nShearson Lehman Brothers. But farmers who elect not to\nparticipate in the program are free to plant all the acreage \nthey have.\n    Some analysts said cotton farmers in the high-yielding\nWestern states would be most likely to steer clear of the\nprogram. \"Western acreage should be up at least 20 pct,\" said\none commission house analyst, whose estimate was based in part\non forecasts made by the National Cotton Council during its\nannual meeting in late January.\n    But others disagreed. \"I think some Western growers have\ndecided they should be in the program for security reasons.\nThere's a lot of comfort in knowing you'll be guaranteed the\ngovernment's loan price of 52.25 cents a lb. Anyone outside the\nprogram is subject to the wiles of the market,\" said Walter\nBrown, market analyst for a major California cotton producer.\n    Some cotton specialists said their expectations for\nincreased acreage might not be verified in Tuesday's planting\nintentions report. \"Anything the USDA is announcing now is\nbased on information they gathered before their cotton program\nwas announced (on March 20),\" one analyst cautioned. She said\ntraders will get a better idea of next year's cotton output\nwhen the USDA's planted acreage report is released on July 9.\n    Brown took that opinion a step further. \"I don't think\nplanted acreage is important. What counts is the abandonment\nrate,\" the difference between acreage planted and acreage\nharvested.\n    Brown said the abandonment rate this year was \"pretty high\"\nat 15.5 pct because of weather problems in key producing\nstates. \"More normal would be about six pct,\" he said.\n Reuter\n",

AMT will contest all three points.\n    The U.K. Companies Act allows the possibility of the\nwinding-up of what it defines as an association, and AMT will\nargue that the Tin Council falls within this definition, Arnold\nsaid.\n    The ITC has immunity except for the enforcement of an\narbitration award, and thus it is important for AMT that the\ncourt accepts that the winding-up petition represents a move to\nenforce an arbitration ruling.\n    The court originally decided that the winding-up petition\nwent wider than the enforcement of such a debt, an AMT\nspokesman said.\n    The appeal is unlikely to be heard for several months, but\na case brought by fellow ITC creditor Maclaine Watson is to be\nheard on April 28. This is a move by the metal broker to have a\nreceiver appointed over the ITC's assets.\n    Since similar arguments will be used in this case, it is\npossible that any appeal in the Maclaine Watson case could be\nconsolidated with AMT's appeal, Arnold said.\n    Other ITC creditors have brought direct actions against the\nCouncil's member states and an application by the governments\nto strike out the first of these, brought by J.H. Rayner\n(Mincing Lane) Ltd, is to be heard on May 11.\n    Shearson Lehman Brothers action against the LME's tin\n\"ring-out\" in March 1986 is also scheduled to be heard in the\nnear future.

It imposed daily and weekly purchase\nlimits, prohibited the BSM from operating on futures markets\nand stipulated, after consumer insistence, that up to 15 pct of\ntotal buffer stock purchases could be of non-member cocoa. This\nwill help prevent lower quality cocoa from Malaysia, the\nworld's fourth largest producer, undermining the market.\n    The cocoa pact establishes precise differentials the Buffer\nStock Manager must use when purchasing varying grades.\n    A new International Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA) was\nadopted earlier this month in Geneva. Importing and exporting\ncountries agreed several changes to make the reference price\nmore responsive to market trends and they eliminated provisions\nunder which the buffer stock could borrow from banks to finance\noperations. Direct cash contributions from members will fund\nbuffer stock purchases. Bank financing was a particular feature\nof the failed ITC buffer stock which suffered losses running\ninto hundreds of millions of sterling. Legal wrangles continue.\n    Recent International Coffee Organization (ICO) negotiations\nin London exemplified the degree to which consumers insist that\nagreements reflect market reality, commodity analysts said.\n    Consumers and a small group of producers argued that\n\"objective criteria\" should be used to define export quota\nshares, which would have meant a reduction in the share of\nBrazil, the world's leading producer. Brazil wanted to maintain\nits previous quota share of 30 pct. The talks broke down and,\nalthough an ICO executive board meeting starts in London today,\ndelegates and trade sources see chances of any near term\nnegotiations on export quota distribution as remote.\n    International agreements exist for sugar and wheat. These\ndo not have any economic clauses but provide a forum for\ndiscussions on possible future economic agreements, collect\nstatistics and draw up market analyses. Analysts said\ndifferences between sugar exporting countries have held up any\nprogress towards an accord with economic teeth, while sheer\ncompetition between major exporters amid a world grain glut\nmilitate against any pact with economic provisions for wheat.\n    An alternative focus for commodity discussions are\ninternational study groups, made up of governments with advice\nfrom industry, such as those for lead and zinc and rubber.\n    The U.N. Common fund for commodities, with a planned\ndirectly contributed capital of 470 mln dlrs, has failed to\nbecome operational because neither the U.S. Nor the Soviet\nUnion has ratified it. U.S. Officials in Washington said the\nU.S. Doubts the fund would be able to fulfil its objectives,\nciting the lack of widespread support.\n    U.S. Officials in Washington and Malaysian officials in\nKuala Lumpur expressed a policy of looking at each commodity\npact case by case. U.S. Officials said it has been willing to\nstudy individual cases for economically sound, market-oriented\ncommodity accords balancing producer and consumer interests.\n    \"We see little to be gained by attempting to increase the\nprice of a commodity whose long-term trend is downward,\"\nofficial Administration policy states. The U.S. Currently\nbelongs to only two international commodity agreements that\nhave economic clauses - the International Coffee Agreement\n(ICA) and INRA - but it is also a member of the sugar and wheat\npacts.\n    The U.S. Did not join the International Cocoa Agreement\nbecause it considered its proposed price ranges unrealistic and\nnot designed to protect the interests of consuming countries,\nthe State Department said. U.S. Officials singled out the INRA\nas the one commodity agreement that seems to be working.\n    U.S. Negotiators were successful in getting other members\nof the pact to agree that the price review and adjustment\nmechanism of the rubber agreement would accurately reflect\nmarket trends and also to continue the accord as a market\noriented agreement, U.S. Officials said.\n    Canadian officials in Ottawa also said they have\nconsistently tried to look at membership of commodity pacts on\nthe merits of each case. Malaysian Primary Industries Minister\nLim Keng Yaik told Reuters in Kuala Lumpur his country, the\nworld's top producer of rubber, tin and palm oil, decides its\nparticipation in international commodity pacts case by case.\n    Malaysia is a member of the Association of Tin Producing\nCountries (ATPC) which produce 65 pct of world tin. The ATPC\nlaunched a plan to limit member tin exports to 96,000 tonnes\nfor a year from March to cut the tin surplus to 50,000 from\n70,000.\n    Economist in the West German Ministry of Agriculture and\ndelegate to cocoa, wheat and sugar agreements Peter Baron told\nReuters in London, \"Agreements with economic clauses to\nstabilise prices could function if fixed price ranges were\nclose to market reality, if there was full participation by\nproducers and consumers, and if participants were prepared to\ntake their obligations in the framework of the agreement\nseriously.\"\n    But Baron added, \"No real sanctions are available for a\ncountry that doesn't stick to its obligations...The German\napproach is sceptical. We don't think agreements are the best\ninstrument to help developing countries. They were never meant\nto be a vehicle for the transfer of resources and that is how\ndeveloping countries often interpret them.\"\n    Traditionally Britain has always been supportive of\ncommodity agreements, reflecting its strong links with Third\nWorld producing countries. But recently demands for more\nstringent and justifiable pacts with emphasis placed on the\nneed for \"intellectual honesty\" and \"objective criteria\" have\ngrown.\n    British officials stress the need for commodity pacts to be\na two way partnership in trade rather than a disguise for aid.\n    It is now seen as essential that any pacts involving direct\nmarket participation through a buffer stock have a high degree\nof transparency and do not contain the risk of open-ended\nborrowing that occurred in the tin pact, they said. U.K.\nDelegates talk of stabilisation and the need for prices to\nreflect changes in market structure and price trends rather\nthan dictate what prices should be.\n    A Foreign Ministry official in Tokyo said Japan urges price\nrealism in commodity pacts, adding high prices inflate supply.\n    A government spokesman in Paris said France is favourable\nto commodity pacts. France, a large consumer and producer of\nsugar, favours a sugar pact as long as it reflects the real\nmarket situation, particularly regarding stocks.\n    Indonesia's Foreign Minister Mochtar Kusumaatmadja told\nReuters in Jakarta: \"These agreements can work as long as the\nproblems are cyclical..But it's another matter when there are\nstructural problems..But we are still committed to commodity\nagreements as an act of faith.\" Nicaraguan External Trade\nMinister Alejandro Martinez Cuenca said in London producers\ncannot afford not to give their backing to commodity\nagreements.\n    \"The political will is not there on the part of some\nconsumers to make agreements work,\" Martinez Cuenca said.\n    The head of the economics department in the Brazilian\nForeign Ministry, Sebastiao do Rego Barros, told Reuters an\nagreement can be successful if it keeps a link with market\nreality. If you have an agreement such as coffee with a system\nof quotas, with a link between prices practised inside the pact\nand actual market prices, it can work. UNCTAD spokesman Graham\nShanley said consuming countries realise steady export earnings\nenhance developing countries' ability to service debt and mean\ngreater demand for industrialised nations' capital goods.\n REUTER\n",

On the inflation\nfront, all is well,\" he said. \"Money supply is well under\ncontrol. It's an absolutely ideal situation.\"\n    February U.S. industrial production rose 0.5 pct, slightly\nless than the 0.7 pct gain the financial markets had expected.\nThis compared with a slim 0.1 pct rise in January's production\nnumber, previously reported as a 0.4 pct increase.\n    The February U.S. producer price index gained only 0.1 pct,\nless than a 0.3-0.4 pct expected rise. This followed a 0.6 pct\nrise in the PPI in January.\n    \"The Fed is going to look at this positively,\" said Allan\nLeslie of Discount Corporation. \"Certainly inflation is not as\nbad as what Volcker (Fed Chairman) has said lately. Industrial\nproduction growth is along the lines of what the Fed wants.\"\n    The energy products component of PPI rose 4.0 pct in\nFebruary, after a 9.8 pct increase in January.\n    \"This shows that the impact of energy prices on inflation\nis behind us in terms of the move from 15 dlrs to 18 dlrs per\nbarrel,\" said Maria Ramirez of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. \"The\ntrend is still 3.5 pct in the first half of the year.\"\n    In 1986, declining energy prices contributed to a 2.5 pct\ndecline in the PPI.\n    Economists said that a rise in energy prices was expected,\nbut a sharp drop in auto prices was not. Passenger car prices\nfell 3.4 pct and light truck prices dropped 1.3 pct.\n    Yesterday, Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker said that\na possibility of renewed inflation remains a concern in both\nthe financial markets and the Federal Reserve.\n    \"The Fed may be lowering its own inflation expectations\ntoday,\" said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities International.\n    While low inflation permits the Fed to maintain an easier\nmonetary policy, Brusca said if import prices do not rise this\ncould necessitate a weaker dollar.\n    \"The outlook for the dollar is still up in the air,\" he\nsaid. \"We need inflation for U.S. producers to compete with\nforeign producers.\"\n    Brusca said prices of electronic equipment dropped 0.8 pct\nin February's PPI. With many electronic goods produced\noverseas, this may show that foreign producers are not raising\nprices which bodes ill for U.S. competitiveness, he said.\n    If further dollar declines are needed, this could diminish\noverseas investment in U.S. debt, Brusca added, which might\nnecessitate higher interest rates and lower bond prices.\n    By contrast, Slifer said imported goods prices rose 11.8\npct from first quarter 1985 to first quarter 1986 reflecting to\na large degree a 22 pct drop in the trade-weighted real value\nof the dollar from February 1985 to February 1987.\n    Slifer said import prices may rise further as\nmanufacturers' contracts put in place before the dollar dropped\nto current levels expire, and new contracts are made that\nreflect a weaker dollar.\n    David Wyss of Data Resources Inc noted that imported\nmanufactured goods prices rose 8.5 pct at an annual rate in the\nsecond half of 1986, which has contributed to rising U.S.\nindustrial output.\n    \"It's the other side of the lower dollar,\" Wyss said.\n\"Producers are beginning to find themselves more competitive\nand they are increasing output.\"\n    Wyss said that the latest data point to an average\nindustrial production gain of 0.3-0.4 pct in the first quarter.\n\"It's an encouraging sign that the manufacturing sector is\nbeginning to revive.\"\n    But Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley and Co Inc was not \nconvinced that the February reports portend economic gains. He\nsaid much of the strength came from factors that do not point\nto a sustained rise in industrial output.\n    Roach pointed out that stikers returning to work in farm\nequipment industries helped account for a one pct rise in\nFebruary business equipment production.\n    Utilities output rose 0.7 pct in February after gaining 1.2\npct in January, but Roach said it shows mostly that more energy\nwas produced, not that manufacturing activity gained.\n    Finally, he pointed out that auto production accounted for\nhalf of the industrial production gain as production of auto\nassemblies rose to 8.3 million units at an annual rate from 7.5\nmillion units.\n    \"In the first quarter, it looks like automakers are\nproducing at an 8.5 mln unit annual rate, but selling at\nroughly a seven mln unit rate,\" Roach said. \"The disparity\nbetween output and sales is showing up in inventories.\"\n    Economists pointed to sharp rise in January U.S. business\ninventories as a sign that production may be outstripping\ndemand in the first quarter of 1987.\n    January business inventories rose 0.9 pct, the largest gain\nsince July 1979 when inventories rose 1.7 pct, the Commerce\nDepartment said. Business sales dropped 4.5 pct in January, the\nlargest monthly sales drop on record.\n    Nonetheless, economists do not expect the Fed to react to\nmonth-to-month changes. \"The Fed has been standing pat for the\nlast seven months,\" Ramirez said. \"They will continue to stand\npat for at least the next couple of months.\"\n Reuter\n",

Some traders and analysts expect limit declines in\nnearby contracts, with spillover selling likely in cattle.\n    University of Missouri agronomist Glen Grimes said,\"The\nreport shows that hog producers have responded to a very\ndesirable feeding ratio that they enjoyed for the past 10\nmonths.\"\n    Shearson Lehman analyst Chuck Levitt said hog futures\nprices are above producers' break even points. Even if futures\nfell the daily limit of 1.50 cents today, producers could still\nlock in a profit, which increases the likelihood of heavy\nselling pressure today.\n    \"We have not had a period of profitability of this\nmagnitude since last summer,\" Levitt said. \"In fact, hog\noperations on many mixed livestock/grain enterprises have been\nso profitable that it actually enabled some farmers to get back\non their feet and refinance their loans just based on the hog\noperation alone.\"\n    Levitt said the weight breakdown in the report also was\nnegative, in that some lead time was anticipated before the\nslaughter increased from the previous year.\n    We expected farmers to increase hog operations, but we\ndidn't expect this degree of expansion to show up in a 10-state\nspring report, Levitt added.\n    High hog corn ratios (the number of bushels of corn that\ncould be bought for 100 lbs of hog) and the resulting increased\nprofits, encouraged farmers and confinement operations to\nincrease production starting late last year.\n    Analysts also noted that part of the increase in the hog\nherd resulted from a revision of the December report and\nwithout the revision, the March report might have been very\nclose to average expectations.\n    Robin Fuller of Agri Analysis said the USDA made a major\nupward revision of 105,000 head in the size of the breeding\nherd in the December 1 report. So the December report was more\nbearish than initially indicated.\n    But Fuller, as well as other analysts, expected the report\nto be less negative on deferred futures contracts. Distant\ncontracts are already at a sharp discount to cash because\ntraders anticipated high farrowing intentions, she noted.\n    Discounts in the October and December contracts take into\nconsideration a six to seven pct increase in March/May\nfarrowing intentions, which was borne out in the March 1\nreport, Fuller said.\n    Grimes said, \"As far as the distant months are concerned,\nif our first quarter pig crop is up only six pct and under 60\nlb inventories actually up only five pct, it would take a\ntremendous discount in price for each percent increase for us\nto push down to the prices that the current futures show for\nthe July and August period.\"\n    Jerry Abbenhaus, analyst for AGE Clearing noted that\ndistant futures prices are already 15 to 20 dlrs lower than\nthey were last summer.\n    \"If cash hogs at the 7-markets last year averaged 61 dlrs\nduring July, that doesn't mean hogs have to be 15 dlrs cheaper\nthis year because we have six pct more numbers,\" he said.\n Reuter\n",

However, he\nsaid new wage agreements in West Germany had raised inflation\nexpectations which would put upward pressure on interest rates\nin the longer term.\n    In the Netherlands, the inflation outlook for 1987 is nil,\nor even negative, while the latest official economic forecasts\npoint to a falling rate of economic growth.\n    \"It will depend on the outcome of collective wage agreement\nnegotiations here whether there could be cost push inflation,\"\nthe ABN economist said.\n    He said Dutch money supply growth, which ran at 3.4 pct in\nJanuary, could also contribute to some inflation.\n    At Amro Bank, a leading analyst said inflation could run to\ntwo pct next year. The bank expects Dutch capital market rates,\ncurrently averaging around 6.1 pct, to stop easing in the\nsecond half of this year and stabilize around 5.6 pct.\n    Analysts said an official rate cut could trigger a buying\nspree on the bond market which would bring yields down,\nprobably only temporarily, while money rates could fall below\nfive pct.\n    Currently, all periods are traded at 5.12 to 5.25 pct in\nthe money market.\n REUTER\n",

Even excluding volatile defense\ngoods, durable goods orders rose a healthy 3.8 pct, the agency\nsaid.\n    The February numbers surpassed the expectations of many\nfinancial analysts, whose predictions ranged from flat to\nincreases of up to five pct.\n    The January/February employment statistics suggest the\nGross National Product will show a healthy rate of growth for\nthe first three months of this year, said Lyle Gramley, an\neconomist with the Mortgage Bankers Association.\n    The U.S. jobless rate in February and January was 6.7 pct,\nthe lowest rate since March 1980. The number of new non-farm\njobs rose by 337,000 in February after a 319,000 gain in\nJanuary and a 225,000 December increase, the government said.\n    The employment data suggests a GNP annual growth rate of\nabout three to 3.25 pct in the first quarter, said Gramley.\n    Much of that will be attributed to businesses rebuilding\ntheir inventories and is not likely to be sustained in the\nsecond quarter, Gramley said. He expects a slowdown in the\nsecond quarter with smaller increases in personal consumption\nand government spending. He also sees residential construction\ndeclining mostly for multi-family housing units.\n    Fidelity Bank senior economist Mickey Levy said some of the\nfourth quarter slowness will continue.\n    Levy predicts GNP will grow at a scant 1.5 pct rate in the\nfirst quarter of 1987, accelerate during the second quarter and\nshow a brisk 4.5 pct annual rate in the third quarter.\n    The key to both forecasts is a marked improvement in the\nU.S. trade balance which is expected because of the decline in\nthe dollar's value over the last year and half.\n    \"The improvement will be gradual and long lasting,\" Levy\npredicted. Most of it will be through import reduction, but at\nleast one-third will be due to a rise in product exports as the\nprices of U.S. goods become more attractive overseas.\n    The Reagan administration has predicted the trade deficit,\nwhich soared to record levels last year, will improve this year\nand the U.S. economy will grow by a respectable 3.2 pct for the\nyear compared with a 2.5 pct rate last year.\n    As part of the effort to reduce the trade deficit, the U.S.\nhas been pressing West Germany and Japan to stimulate their\ndomestic demand for goods from the U.S. and others.\n    U.S. officials believe that would help take some of the\npressure off the United States whose five years of economic\ngrowth has been the mainstay of developing countries.\n    The U.S. economy provided them with a giant market for\ntheir goods giving them a way to earn income badly needed to\nservice their foreign debt.\n    The government last week said the U.S. economy grew at a\nmodest 1.1 pct annual rate during the fourth quarter.\n    There were indications of improvement in the huge imbalance\nbetween the volume of goods imported to the United States and\nthose shipped abroad. The report showed a rising volume of\nexports corresponding to a decline in imports despite the fact\nthat in current dollar terms, the U.S. trade deficit worsened\nduring the closing three months of 1986.\n    While fourth quarter economic growth was weak, corporate\nprofits jumped a healthy 6.1 pct during the period, the\ngovernment said. It also reported that inflation, as measured\nby the GNP price deflator, remained in check, growing a\nmoderate 0.7 pct in the period, the lowest rise in 19 years.\n    The government also reported that consumer spending, a key\nelement of the five year economic recovery, jumped 1.7 pct in\nFebruary, after falling two pct in January.\n    The Federal Reserve Board also reported that the\nmanufacturing sector, which had been one of the weaker elements\nof the U.S. economy, was showing signs of recovery.\n    In its latest report on current economic conditions, the\nFed said that economic activity in the various regions of the\ncountry ranged from uneven or steady to improving.\nManufacturing activity showed signs of improvement in most\nregions except Dallas where orders remained sluggish.\n    Chase Econometrics Chairman Lawrence Chimerine said the\npick up in the U.S. manufacturing sector is largely due to the\ndrop in the dollar's value. He said he does not foresee a major\npick up in economic activity, but does not believe the economy\nwill slip into recession either.\n    He said higher prices on imported products and wage cuts\nthat have helped the manufacturing sector will squeeze\nconsumers purchasing power.\n    \"That pattern is starting and will continue for a number of\nyears,\" Chimerine said.

        "utterance": "Philippine Coconut Authority (PCA)\nchairman Jose Romero said he would visit Brussels later this\nmonth to lobby against a proposed 100 pct European Community\n(EC) levy on vegetable oil imports.\n    \"I intend to visit Brussels and talk to whoever is putting\nup this devilish scheme to impoverish third world countries\nlike the Philippines,\" Romero said in an interview.\n    He said he did not know how much support the levy had\nwithin the EC but he said he believed those originally opposed\nto the tax were under pressure to change their position.\n    Romero said a group of EC members led by West Germany, the\nNetherlands, Denmark and Norway were opposed to the tax. But\nthere was a danger some of them would be persuaded to change\nsides, and if that happened opposition could crumble.\n    Romero said another threat to exports lay in an EC warning\nthat copra meal cake used in livestock feeds contained\ndangerous levels of aflatoxin, a carcinogenic chemical.\n    He said the EC standard of 0.02 parts of aflatoxin per\nmillion parts of meal, which EC countries had been asked to\napply by October 1988, was too rigid. He said Philippine copra\ncake contained much higher levels of aflatoxin.\n    Aflatoxin comes from moulds which develop in copra when it\nis not properly dried or ground.\n    Romero said he would tell big buyers of copra meal in\nLondon that the Philippines was doing its best to meet EC\nstandards. It was also trying to eliminate aflatoxin totally,\nbut this was likely to take several years of research.\n    Copra meal exports were 817,641 tonnes or 35 pct of total\ncoconut exports in 1986. The meal was worth 73.5 mln dlrs.\n    Romero said he would also visit Oxford University's\ndepartment of agricultural economics to discuss ways of\navoiding the copra process altogether.\n    \"There are ways of producing coconut products outside of\ncopra,\" Romero said. \"We can process fresh coconut without drying\nthe meat in the sun. Through the wet process we can process\ncoconuts into other food or non-food products, or we can go to\nthe chemical root.\"\n    He said there was a tendency for agricultural countries to\nbecome more protectionist and he expected export prices of\ncoconut products to drop.\n    \"In the long term we will be getting less and less for more\nand more production, and I'm not comfortable with that,\" he\nsaid.\n    With countries like Indonesia and Malaysia stepping up\nproduction of palm oil, a coconut oil substitute, palm oil\noutput had risen nearly 70 pct since 1971, Romero said.\n    \"To add to that the U.S. Soybean Association is spending\nbillions of dollars to discredit palm oil and coconut oil by\nsaying that they are polysaturated fats and bad for the heart,\"\nhe said.\n    Romero said he expected coconut product export prices to\nstay up for the rest of the year. They would probably touch a\nhigh of 20 cents/pound from the current level of 18.59 cents,\nand a sharp rise from year-ago levels of 10.50 cents.\n    Romero said the Philippines was at the end of a five-year\ncoconut production cycle which showed production tended to fall\nafter two successive years of good harvests.\n    He said 1985 and 1986 were good harvests and this year, to\nadd to the production fall, drought had affected output.\n    \"Traders are stocking up and when they have overbought the\nprices will start declining again. The only sure way to keep\nprices stable is by processing, adding more value,\" he said.\n    Coconut farmers were being encouraged to intercrop by\nplanting other cash crops between coconut trees, he said.\n    \"A typical farm may have from 100 to 150 trees sitting on\n10,000 square metres of land. That's a lot of space,\" Romero\nsaid. He said the government's proposed land reform program\nwould exclude about 75 pct of the coconut farmers because they\nhad less than the proposed seven-hectares of land.\n    \"If the idea of land reform is to increase income levels,\nproduction and employment then it won't happen,\" he said.\n    PCA figures show about one-third of the country's\npopulation is dependent on the coconut industry.\n    Coconuts are planted on about 3.2 mln hectares or\none-fourth of total agricultural land.\n REUTER\n",

It described\nearly development of the new main crop as patchy.\n    The U.S. Agriculture Department (USDA) earlier this year\nforecast a drop in 1986/87 coffee production in the Ivory Coast\ndue to drought in the western part of the country. It estimated\nthe crop at 3.84 mln bags compared with the previous year's\n4.33 mln bag harvest.\n    Ivorian officials have only described this year's coffee\ncrop as \"normal.\"\n REUTER\n",

However, when sufficient selling interest\nto break below chart support in the June contract failed to\nmaterialize, participants who had sold bond futures early\nquickly covered short positions, they said.\n    \"Everyone is expecting strong numbers, and if they come in\nas expected it won't be that bad for the market,\" Sloane said.\n    Sloane said the consensus estimate for the non-auto sector\nof retail sales is for a rise of 0.6 to 0.7 pct.\n    Dean Witter analyst Karen Gibbs said a retail sales figure\nbelow market forecasts would give a boost to debt futures, and\nshe put the range for the non-auto sector of retail sales at up\n0.8 to 1.2 pct.\n    Industrial production and the producer price index Friday\nboth are expected to show increases of about 0.5 pct, she\nadded.\n    Retail sales \"will tell us whether or not we will be able\nto fill the gap,\" Gibbs said, referring to a chart gap in June\nbonds between 100-26/32 and 101-3/32 created Friday. June bonds\nclosed at 100-4/32 today.\n    Also key to debt futures direction, in addition to the\nfederal funds rate, is the direction of crude oil prices, said\nCarroll McEntee and McGinley Futures analyst Brian Singer.\n    \"A higher fed funds rate and firm oil prices precluded the\nmarket from breaking out of the trading range the last time the\nmarket approached the top of the range,\" Singer said.\n    In order for bonds to break above the top of the range,\nwhich is just below 102 in the June contract, \"the crude oil\nrally needs to run its course and pull back a little bit,\"\nSinger said. \"Fed funds are already easing back down toward the\nsix pct level.\"\n    The recent surge in oil prices has also been a concern to\nManufacturers Hanover Futures analyst Jim Rozich, but the rally\nmay be nearing a top around 18.50 dlrs per barrel, he said.\n    Rozich said he is looking for the June bond contract to\nease to 99-6/32 and find support.\n    \"I'm not quite ready to jump on the bullish bandwagon yet.\nThe jury is still out this week,\" Rozich said.\n Reuter\n",

Specific demand has been directed towards metal in\nGothenburg and Trieste warehouses. Gothenburg material is often\na target for merchants shipping to the USSR, traders said.\n    On stocks, the popular LME Continental warehouses, Antwerp\nand Rotterdam, have little more than 3,000 tonnes of lead each,\nand this is believed to be in strong hands.\n    Out of a total 22,125 tonnes in LME stocks, the lowest\nlevel since June 1980, just over half is in U.K. Warehouses\nwhich are not popular with merchants putting together\nshipments.\n    But even U.K. Stocks have dropped around 6,000 tonnes since\nthe start of the year. Traders said this is partly due to\nsecondary smelters buying ingots to supplement feed supplies\naffected by environmental controls, which put restrictions on\nthe transport of used batteries.\n    Labour negotiations in North America will play an important\npart in determining the direction of prices, with contracts\nexpiring end-April at Cominco's Trail and Kimberley, B.C.,\nMine/smelter and at Doe Run's Herculaneum, Mo, smelter.\n    Noranda's New Brunswick mine/smelter also has a contract\nexpiry in July which may cause some nervousness in view of\nstrikes by its zinc and copper workers over recent months.\n    Traders said LME three months delivery, already attracting\nspeculative buying, could rise to 320/330 stg on current\nfirmness, while nearby tightness could widen the cash premium\nto 20 from four.

He forecast the\nChancellor's Budget tax cuts would increase consumer expediture\non imported goods.\n    However, Ian Harwood, economist at Warburg Securities, said\nhis firm was sharply revising its 1987 current account deficit\nforecast in the light of the latest data, cutting one billion\nstg off the expected full year total to about 1.75 billion stg.\n    He said news of strong growth in exports of non-oil goods\nconfirmed recent bullish surveys among members of the\nConfederation of British Industry.\n    The growth in imports appears to be flattening, even if\nJanuary's bad weather had curbed consumer spending on overseas\ngoods and import-intensive stock building among manufactureres,\nHarwood said.\n    U.K. Government bonds, or gilts, surged by more than 1/2\npoint on the better-than-expected news, as earlier worries\nabout the figures evaporated.\n    Sterling peaked at a high of 1.6075 dlrs, before settling\nto a steady 1.6050 dlrs about 1300 GMT, nearly a cent higher\nthan the European low of 1.5960.\n    However, analysts noted that the turnabout in market\nsentiment still looks highly vulnerable to political news.\n    Morning weakness in sterling and the gilt market was\nlargely attributed to a newspaper opinion poll showing that the\nConservative government's support was slipping.\n    The Marplan poll, published in \"Today,\" showed Conservative\nsupport had fallen to 36 pct, from 38 pct last month, while the\nAlliance of Liberals and Social Democrats had rallied to 31\npct, from 21 pct, to run neck and neck with the Labour Party,\nwhose own support fell from 38 pct.\n    The poll was taken after the Budget, which was greeted\nenthusiastically by financial markets but seems to have left\nthe voters indifferent, political observers said.\n    Another regular poll is due tomorrow, and eonomists warn\nthat today's improved sentiment could be dented if support for\nPrime Minister Margaret Thatcher slips again.\n    This upsetting of the markets' political perceptions, which\nare all but discounting a Conservative victory in the upcoming\ngeneral election, made them more sensitive to the trade data,\nHarwood said. \"The news did come as a very, very substantial\nrelief,\" he said.\n    However, on the interest rate front, economists caution\nthat Lawson might be wary of leaving sterling vulnerable by\nencouraging another base rate fall. They noted Lawson had\nalready got an inflation-reducing cut in mortgage rates in\nresponse to lower base rates, so domestic political reasons for\nlower rates have been curtailed.\n REUTER\n",

Analysts say if the banks do not intervene\neffectively, the Paris accord could collapse.\n    \"On balance, sterling would be a net sufferer if G-6\ncollapses,\" Phillips and Drew analyst Stephen Lewis said.\n    He said sterling would lose out as markets turned their\nattention to capital movements whereas previously they had been\nrestricted to looking only at the interest yield on currencies.\n    However, although most analysts and foreign exchange\ndealers were forecasting a brief period of consolidation or\neven retracement for sterling, none were expecting a very sharp\ndrop in the U.K. Currency.\n    Sterling remained supported by optimism on the U.K.\nPolitical and economic outlook, firmer oil prices and\nrelatively high interest rates, they said.\n    Bullish sentiment on the U.K. Economic outlook has been\nrunning especially high after last week's budget, seen as\npopular both with the markets and with British voters.\n    Sterling was also supported by signs of a weakening in the\nWest German and Japanese economies, where growth for 1987 is\ntrailing behind the three pct forecast for the U.K.\n    Recent opinion polls showing Britain's ruling conservative\nparty ahead of opposition parties in popularity have also\nsupported the pound.\n    In addition, sterling has so far shrugged off two\nhalf-point cuts in U.K. Bank base lending rates in less than\ntwo weeks. A further half-point cut, widely expected in the\nnext week or so, has already been largely discounted.\n    U.K. Base rates, now running at 10 pct, are still\nrelatively high compared to other western countries, and\nanalysts said a further base rate cut to 9-1/2 pct was unlikely\nto affect sterling.\n    Sterling today appeared resilient to the dollar's decline,\ndropping only slightly on a cross-rate basis.\n    Worries about renewed turbulence in the foreign exchange\nmarkets, however, were reflected in the U.K. Government bond\n(gilt) market, where prices dropped by up to 5/16 point.\n    Until now foreign investor interest in the gilt market has\nbeen one of the major reasons behind the rise in sterling.\n    Dealers said they expected the pound to hold quietly steady\nfor the next few days while the market awaits further\ndevelopments on the dollar and this Thursday's U.K. Current\naccount figures for February.\n    Market forecasts are for a deficit of around 250 mln stg\nafter January's small surplus.\n REUTER\n",

New production\nforecasts were made for all these crops.\n    The rains over the weekend and up to yesterday registered\nmore than 200 mm on average in western Buenos Aires and\nworsened the flooding in various parts of the province.\n    The weather bureau said the rains, which in Buenos Aires\nhave surpassed 750 mm in the last 30 days, could continue.\n    The northeast of the country was also hit by heavy rains.\n    In Corrientes province the rains also passed an average of\n200 mm in some parts, notably the Paso de los Libres area\nbordering on Uruguay.\n    In Santa Fe and Entre Rios provinces they were over 100 mm\nin places, in Misiones and San Luis 90 mm and in Cordoba 80 mm.\n    The rains were less intense in Chaco and Formosa.\n    Harvesting in areas not actually under water could also be\nfurther delayed due to dampness in the earth, the sources said.\n    The excessive humidity might also produce rotting of the\ncrops, further dimishing the yield, the sources added.\n    Sunflower harvesting before the weekend rains reached 26 to\n30 pct of the area sown in Santa Fe, Cordoba, La Pampa and\nBuenos Aires provinces.\n    The production forecast for 1986/87 sunflowerseed has been\nlowered to between 2.2 and 2.4 mln tonnes, against 2.3 to 2.6\nmln tonnes the previous week, making it 41.5 to 46.3 pct lower\nthan the record 4.1 mln tonnes produced last season.\n    The area sown was two to 2.2 mln hectares, down 29.9 to\n36.3 pct on the record 3.14 mln hectares in 1985/86.\n    The maize harvest advanced to within 26 to 28 pct of the\narea sown in Cordoba, Santa Fe and northern Buenos Aires.

Economists estimated that 30,000 of the gain was\naccounted for by striking workers in the steel and machinery\nindustries returning to work.\n    Even so, some economists said that the manufacturing gains\nhave resulted from an improving trade outlook.\n    Jason Benderly of Goldman, Sachs and Co noted that the U.S.\ntrade picture improved in the fourth quarter as net exports\ngrew at a 20 pct annual rate while the rate of increase in\nimports fell to only six pct, and that it continues to improve\nin the first quarter.\n    \"Not only the official statistics for the fourth quarter,\nbut evidence of a pick up in orders from overseas for paper\nproducts, chemicals, high-tech goods, and capital goods show\nthat trade is improving,\" Benderley said.\n    \"The economy is moving between extremes,\" he said. \"Some\nreports are going to look bad and some good, but first quarter\nGNP is going to grow in the middle at about three pct.\"\n    A 287,000 gain in services employment comprised the greater\npart of February's employment gain. Retail services employment\nrose 129,000 in February, compared to a gain of 117,000 in\nJanuary, previously reported at 166,000.\n    Construction employment rose a slim 2,000 in February. But\nthis follows a robust 113,000 gain in January, revised down\nfrom a previously reported 142,000 gain.\n    The U.S. civilian unemployment rate was unchanged in\nFebruary at 6.7 pct. This means the jobless rate has stayed at\n6.7 pct for three consecutive months, the lowest reading since\nMarch 1980, the Commerce Department noted.\n    \"The Federal Reserve has to be pleased with this report,\"\nCarson said. \"This takes away the Fed's flexibility to ease,\nbut there's no reason to tighten. It's way too early for that.\"\n      \n Reuter\n",

The cost of transport is higher than\nthe value of the animal, he said.\n    U.S. Officials said the Japan Livestock Industry Promotion\nCorporation which regulates beef imports, was forced to borrow\nfrom the fiscal 1987 quota earlier this year because the 1986\nquota was exhausted and Japanese beef prices were rising. Japan\nhas said it cannot open its markets to beef imports.\n    Along with beef, the U.S. Will also press Japan to\neliminate import quotas on fresh oranges and orange juice by\nApril, 1988. Some U.S. Officials believe Japan may eventually\nbe willing to scrap the quota on fresh oranges because\nliberalized trade would not necessarily damage the Japanese\nmandarin orange industry.\n    The quota on juice may be harder to eliminate because\nimports might replace domestic produced juice, U.S. And\nJapanese officials have said.\n   Lyng has resurrected a past U.S. Proposal that Japan buy\nsurplus U.S. Foodgrains for donation to developing countries,\nbut some U.S. Officials are skeptical action will be taken.\n   Lyng will also urge Japan to put its domestic farm policies,\nincluding rice, on the negotiating table during GATT talks in\nGeneva.

Growers had harvested seven to nine pct of\ntotal planted area, compared to five to seven pct last week.\n    Total maize area planted for the 1986/87 harvest was\nestimated at between 3.58 and 3.78 mln hectares, or two to\nseven pct less than the 3.85 mln hectares planted in the\n1985/86 harvest.\n    Maize production is expected to total between 10.4 and 11\nmln tonnes, or a drop of 17.5 to 19.4 pct over the 12.4 to 12.6\nmln tonnes harvested last year according to private estimates,\nor 18.9 to 21.9 pct lower than last year's volume, according to\nofficial figures.\n    The sunflower harvest advanced to between seven and nine\npct of total planted area.\n    Two to 2.2 mln hectares have been planted with sunflowers\nfor this harvest, down 29.9 to 36.3 pct from last year's figure\nof 3.14 mln hectares.\n    Sunflower production is expected to total between 2.4 mln\nand 2.7 mln tonnes, which would mean a drop of between 34.1 and\n41.5 pct against the record 4.1 mln tonnes harvested in the\n1985/86 harvest.\n    Grain sorghum harvesting inched forward to between two and\nfour pct of total planted area, which this harvest is 1.23 to\n1.30 mln hectares or 10.3 to 15.2 pct less than the 1.45 mln\nhectares planted in the 1985/86 harvest.\n    Sorghum production is expected to total between 3.2 mln and\n3.5 mln tonnes, or 16.7 to 22 pct less than the 4.1 to 4.2\nmillion tonnes harvested in 1985/86.\n    Soybean production, by contrast, is expected to hit a\nrecord 8.0 to 8.4 mln tonnes, which would mean an increase of\n11.1 to 15.1 pct over last year's record figure of 7.2 to 7.3\nmln tonnes, according to private estimates. Official figures\nput last year's soybean harvest at 7.1 mln tonnes.\n    Soybean crops were reported to be in generally very good\ncondition, helped by abundant rains and high temperatures.\n    Total soybean-planted area for the 1986/87 harvest is\nexpected to be a record 3.7 to 3.8 mln hectares, up 10.8 to\n13.8 pct from last year's harvest figure of 3.34 mln hectares.\n Reuter\n",
