            "text": "Data source: Diplomat Pharmacy.\nWhat happened with Diplomat Pharmacy this quarter?\nMost of the overall increase in revenue came from the PBM companies Diplomat acquired and rolled into CastiaRx. Revenue for the legacy specialty-pharmacy business grew 8% year over year; drug infusions led the way, up 13%.\nGross margin for the specialty segment dropped from 5.8% in the year-ago quarter to 5.5% in the third quarter, but the company is still making almost as much per prescription: $287 per script in the third quarter versus $289 per script in the year-ago quarter.\nDuring the quarter, Diplomat added two more limited-distribution drugs to its exclusive or semi-exclusive offering of more than 120 drugs.\nCastiaRx is profitable, generating $26 million in gross profit in the quarter. But selling, general and administrative expenses, and interest expenses from debt taken on to pay for the acquisitions, resulted in the company only breaking even for the quarter.\nThe integration of the PBMs has generated $7 million in synergies so far this year, putting the company on track to hit its guidance of $8 million to $10 million in synergies in 2018.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nWhat management had to say\nChairman and CEO Brian Griffin\nlaid it out frankly\n: \"With respect to the CastiaRx launch in April, this is really early days relative to our pure PBM performance. It is a rebuilding year for us.\"\nDiplomat is going to lose some Medicare Part D PBM contracts at the start of next year, but those were relatively low-margin contracts set up by the previous owners, as chief financial officer Atul Kavthekar outlined:\nWe expect the loss of this business to negatively impact Diplomat's 2019 revenue by approximately 4%. Our objective is to offset this revenue loss with new relatively higher-margin business, some of which we've already booked. We are still in the midst of the 2019 PBM selling season, and so a full view into the 2019 outlook is not currently available, but will be incorporated in our 2019 guidance.\nLooking forward\nManagement dropped the top end of its 2018 revenue guidance, which previously went up to $5.9 billion; it now expects revenue to fall between $5.5 billion and $5.7 billion. Bottom-line guidance for 2018 was increased to a range of a loss of $0.10 per share to a gain of $0.03 per share, up from the previous range of a loss of $0.15 per share to a gain of $0.01.\nMore important than the 2018 numbers is guidance for 2019, to see whether the rebuilding created a better team. Unfortunately, the smaller companies that Diplomat is wooing for its PBM business don't tend to make decisions until late in the year, so management won't be able to give 2019 guidance until early next year.\nhas no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

It will enable the company to help growers in their decarbonisation journey, impart agronomic knowledge to help produce quality crop yield and healthier soil and connect farmers to the carbon credit market.\nEven after the separation, Agoro Carbon Alliance will remain 100 per cent owned and backed by Yara, and the two companies will continue to collaborate closely.

This move allows us to focus fully on our Indian growers success by keeping strategic control and flexibility around our core offerings while also cementing our position as a strong, independent and highly motivated agent of change in the Indian agriculture sector. India has a big role to play in global food security, and we at Agoro Carbon, as a high-impact, independent, global business, are well-poised to partner locally with Indian growers to achieve massive farm-level decarbonization, Prithviraj Sen Sharma, Managing Director of Agoro Carbon Alliance India,\nAgoro Carbon is encouraging Indian farmers to adopt climate-friendly farming techniques and assisting them in producing in a sustainable manner. The company has been working with small holder farmers in Wardha, Maharashtra and Punjab.\nAlex Bell, CEO of Agoro Carbon Alliance, said, Our independent status gives us the best of both worlds: enabling Yaras full strategic backing of Agoro Carbon, while giving us even more operational flexibility. Agoro Carbon will continue to focus on practical agronomic excellence and be input and practice agnostic. The separation underscores our intent and confirms our ability to be entirely focused on providing best in class and unbiased farmer enablement to generate premium environmental assets for responsible buyers and investors.\nPublished on",

            "text": "160\nVitamin D\nBOSTON HEALTH Vitamin D deficiency strongly exaggerates the craving for and effects of opioids, potentially increasing the risk for dependence and addiction, according to a new study led by researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). These findings, published in Science Advances, suggest that addressing the common problem of vitamin D deficiency with inexpensive supplements could play a part in combating the ongoing scourge of opioid addiction.\nEarlier work by David E. Fisher, MD, PhD, director of the Mass General Cancer Centers Melanoma Program and director of MGHs Cutaneous Biology Research Center (CBRC), laid the foundation for the current study. In 2007, Fisher and his team found something unexpected: Exposure to ultraviolet (UV) rays (specifically the form called UVB), causes the skin to produce the hormone endorphin, which is chemically related to morphine, heroin and other opioidsin fact, all activate the same receptors in the brain. A subsequent study by Fisher found that UV exposure raises endorphin levels in mice, which then display behavior consistent with opioid addiction.\nEndorphin is sometimes called a feel good hormone because it induces a sense of mild euphoria. Studies have suggested that some people develop urges to sunbathe and visit tanning salons that mirror the behaviors of opioid addicts. Fisher and his colleagues speculated that people may seek out UVB because they unknowingly crave the endorphin rush. But that suggests a major contradiction. Why would we evolve to be behaviorally drawn towards the most common carcinogen that exists? asked Fisher. After all, sun exposure is the primary cause of skin cancer, to say nothing of wrinkles and other skin damage.\nFisher believes that the only explanation for why humans and other animals seek out the sun is that exposure to UV radiation is necessary for production of vitamin D, which our bodies cant formulate on their own. Vitamin D promotes uptake of calcium, which is essential for building bone. As tribes of humans migrated north during prehistoric times, an evolutionary alteration might have been needed to compel them to step out of caves and into the sunshine on bitterly cold days. Otherwise, small children would have died of prolonged vitamin D deficiency (the cause of rickets) and weak bones might have shattered when people ran from predators, leaving them vulnerable.\nThis theory led Fisher and colleagues to hypothesize that sun seeking is driven by vitamin D deficiency, with the goal of increasing synthesis of the hormone for survival, and that vitamin D deficiency might also make the body more sensitive to the effects of opioids, potentially contributing to addiction. Our goal in this study was to understand the relationship between vitamin D signaling in the body and UV-seeking and opioid-seeking behaviors, says lead author Lajos V. Kemny, MD, PhD, a postdoctoral research fellow in Dermatology at MGH.\nIn the Science Advances paper, Fisher, Kemny and a multidisciplinary team from several institutions addressed the question from dual perspectives. In one arm of the study, they compared normal laboratory mice with mice that were deficient in vitamin D (either through special breeding or by removing vitamin D from their diets). We found that modulating vitamin D levels changes multiple addictive behaviors to both UV and opioids, says Kemny. Importantly, when the mice were conditioned with modest doses of morphine, those deficient in vitamin D continued seeking out the drug, behavior that was less common among the normal mice. When morphine was withdrawn, the mice with low vitamin D levels were far more likely to develop withdrawal symptoms.\nThe study also found that morphine worked more effectively as a pain reliever in mice with vitamin D deficiencythat is, the opioid had an exaggerated response in these mice, which may be concerning if its true in humans, too, says Fisher. After all, consider a surgery patient who receives morphine for pain control after the operation. If that patient is deficient in vitamin D, the euphoric effects of morphine could be exaggerated, says Fisher, and that person is more likely to become addicted.\nThe lab data suggesting that vitamin D deficiency increases addictive behavior was supported by several accompanying analyses of human health records. One showed that patients with modestly low vitamin D levels were 50 percent more likely than others with normal levels to use opioids, while patients who had severe vitamin D deficiency were 90 percent more likely. Another analysis found that patients diagnosed with opioid use disorder (OUD) were more likely than others to be deficient in vitamin D.\nBack in the lab, one of the studys other critical findings could have significant implications, says Fisher. When we corrected vitamin D levels in the deficient mice, their opioid responses reversed and returned to normal, he says. In humans, vitamin D deficiency is widespread, but is safely and easily treated with low-cost dietary supplements, notes Fisher. While more research is needed, he believes that treating vitamin D deficiency may offer a new way to help reduce the risk for OUD and bolster existing treatments for the disorder. Our results suggests that we may have an opportunity in the public health arena to influence the opioid epidemic, says Fisher.\nTAGS",

Courtesy of COMO Hotels.\nWhen my alarm went off at 7 A.M., following a jet lag-induced sleepless night at Londons Nobu Portman Square hotel, I was not pleased. Unwillingly, I tumbled out of bed, climbed into workout leggings, slid my feet into my slippers and took the elevator down the spa floor. It was a Monday morningmy second day in London after flying in from New Yorkand for some reason I thought it would be a good idea to book a 7:30am Pilates class at the hotels studio; as a Pilates fan, an in-hotel reformer studio sounded like a dream.\nAccessible from the street (for locals) or via elevator (for guests), the wood-clad studio, lined with ten slick black reformers, has a number of morning and evening classes from classic to more energetic power flow. Not only is it a great way to help kick jet lag, but its an opportunity to do some pelvic curls with new instructors, as well as Pilates enthusiasts from the neighborhood.\nThe pilates studio at the Nobu Portman Hotel in London is open to guests and locals alike.\nCourtesy of Nobu Hotels.\nPerhaps fueled by at-home mat workouts or a need for more breath work during a stressful time, Pilates has become increasingly popular. Hotels are catching on, offering everything from basic mat classes under canopies of trees to advanced reformer sessions in polished, kitted-out studios.\nThe decision to put a Pilates studio in was a natural fit, considering it is getting a lot more spotlight as a way to train the body from a 360 perspective, says Marsha Lindsay, the creative director of Nobu Pilates. People are prioritizing correct movement and overall longevity much more [since the pandemic]. And Pilates focuses on training your muscles in a functional way, Not only has she noticed the guests Pilates appreciation post long-haul flight, but how people are increasingly craving breath-focused exercises.\nA pavilion among the treetops at BodyHoliday in St. Lucia is used for both yoga and pilates mat classes.\nCourtesy of BodyHoliday\nA travelers decision to stay at a certain hotel, or even to book a certain destination, can often come down to its fitness offerings: Does the gym have a Peloton bike? Is the pool long enough to do laps? Is there a yoga studio nearby? Pilates is no exception.\nIt comes as no surprise that COMO hotels, a brand known for its wellness programming, would launch group mat and private reformer classes at its Parrot Cay private island property in Turks & Caicos. Lisa Manser, COMO Shambalas group wellness director, has seen an increase in demand for the workout, partly due to the fact that theres a growing variety of methods. Theres a significant rise in Pilates instructors who practice other modalitiesphysiotherapists, massage therapists and Personal trainersthat Pilates can enhance. Better still, the hotel has a 90 minute head-to-toe Pilates alignment session, a curated experience that includes a full body alignment screening and session with an expert, as well as a takeaway body chart with tailored exercises to do at home. (We also recommend a post-pilates dip in the glimmering Caribbean sea.)\nA few islands away, on the balmy island of St. Lucia, BodyHoliday offers group glasses on the hotels Zen Deck, set high up amongst the trees, that all guests can attend as part of the all-inclusive room rate. Pilates allows for guests of all skill-sets to be included, as the exercises can be easily modified, says Andrew Barnard, Managing Director of Sunswept Resorts, which manages the property.\nAt COMO, alignment sessions are offered, complete with a menu of exercises to continue once youre back at home.\nCourtesy of COMO Hotels\nSome places are even teaming up with local experts to help ramp up their programming. Las Ventanas al Paraso, a Rosewood Resort in Los Cabos, began working with Modu Seye, owner of Moduvated, a local health and lifestyle company in 2019. She leads mat and reformer classes as well as different fusion classes including Yogalates, Barre mixed with Pilates and Suspension Pilates. Its an integrative experience that connects mind, body and soul, which travelers today are looking for, says Seye.\nFurther south, Flor Blanca, located along the wild Pacific Coast in Santa Teresa, Costa Rica, also has an oceanfront Pilates studio with every piece of Pilates equipment you can imagine, from springboards to towers, spine correctors and chairs. Its run by a bevy of highly trained instructors offering private and group classes, as well as osteopaths and physiotherapists specializing in therapeutic sessions. This is a Pilates oasis at its best.\nAt CIVANA Wellness Resort & Spa in the Sonoran Desert, the schedule is packed with yoga, meditation and traditional Pilates mat classes. Pilates is seeing a resurgence in popularity, because of its accessibility. Every body type can benefit from and adapt the practice to their particular needs, says Amanda Grant, CIVANAs chief program and partnership officer. With the mat format in particular, it helps that it can be done anywhere.\nBut, like yoga, people arent just incorporating Pilates into their hotel routines, theyre traveling for it too. Shanti-Som in Malaga, Spain, has retreats where travelers can spend between three and ten days doing unlimited spinal twists and teasers. The retreat also includes carefully-planned meals, body scrubs, massages and meditation.\nEven after my rude awakening, my hour-long power class at Nobu Pilates was positively day-changing. I walked in feeling like a zombie and left ready to tackle a schedule full of meetings. Presumably, Im not the only guest who feels this way. According to Nobu, they've seen positive responses from other guestsperhaps part of the reason why theyll be launching more studios at their other hotels. Expanding the concept and launching wellness retreats is in the pipeline, says Lindsay. Its only the beginning of the journey.",

The scholarship is available to all of the universitys 200 degree programs undergraduate, graduate and professional programs.\nAdvertisement\nIn February, Trilogy and the University of Louisville announced a program offering priority admission to Trilogy employees to attend the colleges nursing program, beginning this fall. The school will work toward accepting up to 25 Trilogy employees per semester, and up to 50 annually. Trilogy Health Services and The Bufford Family Foundation also jointly committed $250,000 towards revitalizing the U of L School of Nursings simulation lab.\nTrilogy is also in the process of formalizing a similar partnership with the Galen College of Nursing Louisville to offer employees priority admission, in the schools Louisville and Cincinnati campuses. These partnerships are intended to give Trilogy employees seeking a career path an opportunity to do so, and in highly competitive nursing programs.\nNursing schools traditionally have limited spots, so they can be difficult to get into. That makes it a little bit more challenging for someone who wants to go from an LPN to an RN, Barney said. If we have designated spots within these nursing programs, then we can put our employees in there and that gives us a leg up.\nAdvertisement\nTrilogy was the 33rd-largest senior living provider in the United States in 2019, according to rankings compiled by industry association Argentum. Overall, the company has a portfolio that includes 110 communities spread across Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio and Michigan. The company is jointly owned by Griffin American Healthcare REIT III and NorthStar Healthcare Income.\nIn this interview, Barney shares details of Trilogys Covid-19 response including how it has segmented its communities to address potential outbreaks; the impact the pandemic is having on its development pipeline; and permanent operational changes stemming from the outbreak including potential involvement in new service lines.\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\nRecommended SHN+ Exclusives\nHow is Trilogy handling markets where there are surges in positive coronavirus cases?\nWe operate in the Midwest, so weve never had the large cases like the Northeast or California or the Southeast. It was a little bit different based on each state and probably had to do with how each state closed and when they closed for business.\nAs communities started to reopen, the biggest thing weve seen recently has been a larger uptick of positives from employees. We attribute that to the vacation season. We had numerous employees taking off and going places. We have a process in place, especially if they go to a hotspot, they have to get tested and have a negative test before they come back to work. We are seeing more positives from those tests. The good thing about this is now that we have testing, we can quarantine those employees and were not seeing the spread as significantly within our facilities. We are catching it from our testing processes that we didnt have access to as readily back in March when things were starting.\nHow are the communities set up to prevent outbreaks, and to isolate residents who test positive?\nWeve split our communities into green units, yellow units and red units. The folks that are in the green units have all been tested and theyre negative for Covid-19. The yellow unit is a transitional unit. This would be where a new admission would come into the facility. Theyll go into the yellow unit for at least two weeks, and theyll be tested. Once we have two negative tests, theyll move off to the green.\nIf someone tests positive, we put them into the red unit and we only have staff that works exclusively on a red unit, so theres no cross contamination between any of the units. They have a separate entryway, PPE is lined up for everybody within that unit. We keep it very contained and very manageable. I think that has helped us.\nThis was something that we developed early on in one of our campuses when we had an outbreak. And we figured that this was the best way to manage it. That also gave us more comfort in our ability to take people from outside the community as admissions, because we know that were not going to mingle them in with everyone else.\nHas Trilogy considered moving staff working in these red units\non-site\n?\nWe havent asked anyone to stay away from their family. Working on the red unit has been voluntary. For the folks that are willing and want to do that, there is extra compensation. Typically the people that do work in that unit, you have the ability to quarantine or maybe it wouldnt be someone who has an underlying health issue.\nWhat other incentives is Trilogy offering its employees?\nOur foundation has historically been known for educational opportunities, as well as employee assistance. We continue to help our employees through that employee assistance program. Weve seen more needs along the lines of child care assistance, as well as helping with food, and we may pay bills. We have seen an increase in the need. Weve also tried to increase our foundation contributions.\nHave there been any changes to Trilogys educational initiatives since the virus spread across the country. Specifically, what is the status of the\nPurdue University Global Initiative\n?\nWe did a pause on new enrollment, but everybody thats in the program is able to continue. We expect that in January well be able to open it back up to new enrollees.\nThe apprenticeship programs that we run, were still promoting, and those all come with pay increases, from the workforce grants that we were able to receive to help fund those programs.

Gretchen Whitmer's administration wants to consolidate multiple contracts for managed care of dental services for Medicaid recipients into one contract, potentially shaking up the delivery of oral health care for the state's poorest residents.\nThe proposed 2023 budget blueprint Whitmer submitted Wednesday to the Legislature calls for a single contract for three different types of benefits: Medicaid-funded dental services through the Healthy Kids Dental program, the dental benefit of the Healthy Michigan Plan for low-income adults and traditional fee-for-service dental care for adults.\nWhitmer's budget proposal for the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services also calls for raising the fee-for-service reimbursement rates for providers by $247.6 million annual to get more dentists to accept the lowest-paying Medicaid patients.\nMDHHS Director Elizabeth Hertel said her department wants a single procurement for managed care of dental services, but that doesn't mean it will be awarded to a single company.\n\"Having a single contract allows for easier management of the beneficiaries and being able to have a network that's adequate across the state,\" Hertel told Crain's.\nThe nearly more than 980,000 low-income adults enrolled in the state's Medicaid program, Healthy Michigan Plan, who get dental benefits through HMP's managed care insurers, such as Health Alliance Plan of Michigan, McLaren Health Plan and Priority Health.\nThose health insurers typically subcontract management of Healthy Michigan's dental benefits to Delta Dental, DentaQuest, DenteMax or another PPO, said Dominick Pallone, executive director of the Michigan Association of Health Plans.\nMAHP supports raising reimbursement rates for dentists, but has \"concerns\" about breaking off a portion of its members' managed care contracts in the Healthy Michigan Plan, Pallone said.\nDominick Pallone\n\"For the Healthy Michigan Plan, we've got that built into our rates,\" Pallone said. \"... If you're going to pull a member's dental benefit out of an integrated benefit and assign it to a different managed care entity, I don't know how you could assume savings.\"\nThe Whitmer administration's proposed increase in fee-for-service provider rates for dentists would cost the state's general fund $69.8 million, while drawing down $177.8 million in matching federal funds, according to the State Budget Office.\nHertel declined to say how much MDHHS spends annually for dental services through all of its Medicaid programs.\n\"We don't generally share what dollar number we're looking at prior to doing a procurement,\" Hertel told Crain's. \"We like to see what people come in at instead of giving them a target.\"\nBy consolidating all Medicaid dental services under one contract, Hertel said, it could eliminate gaps in provider networks.\nCurrently, children in the Healthy Kids Dental program may get service from one dentist who doesn't accept their mother in the traditional Medicaid fee-for-service program or the Healthy Michigan managed care program, Hertel said.\n\"Which is why it's important in this proposal (that) not only are we pulling these together into one managed care contract, but we're also looking to increase the reimbursement rates for dental,\" Hertel said.\n\"The goal here really is to increase access to dental services,\" Hertel said. \"Do I think it will save money? I think in the long run it could save money (by ensuring) adults who currently aren't receiving dental care receive the dental care that they need to avoid more acute or serious issues.\"\nThe contract consolidation move comes four years after the state health department broke up the Healthy Kids Dental contract that Delta Dental of Michigan Inc. had held since its inception in 2000.\nSince 2018, Delta Dental has shared the contract with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, which has used Boston-based DentaQuest as a subcontractor to perform most of the work managing dental benefits for low-income children.\nThat contract survived a court challenge by a third dental benefits managed care firm, Fort Lauderdale-based MCNA Insurance Co. Inc., which alleged Blue Cross acted as a \"shell vendor\" to win a share of the Medicaid business for children's dental care.\nDelta Dental's Healthy Kids Dental contract is valued at $912 million for the fiscal year that ends Sept. 30; Blue Cross' contract is valued at $612.7 million, according to the contracts.\nOkemos-based Delta Dental currently serves 795,000 children in the Healthy Kids Dental program and 191,000 adults through four health plans under the Healthy Michigan Plan, said Rick Lantz, vice president and chief lobbyist for Dental Dental.\nDelta Dental supports the health department's proposed consolidation of all Medicaid dental benefits under one procurement because the current system is bifurcated, leading to different oral health outcomes for the same population of low-income adults, Lantz said.\n\"This has the potential to dramatically improve access to care for Michigan's low-income adults. Delta Dental's position is that it's vital that we make this investment as dental disease left untreated can cause severe pain, infection and diminished overall health.\"\nAdults enrolled in Medicaid health insurance programs often struggle to access dental care, Lantz said.\n\"And because of this, they often show up in hospital emergency departments because their dental pain or infection is so severe that they can't tolerate it anymore,\" Lantz said. \"... We believe it's time to apply the successes of Healthy Kids Dental to that adult program to ensure that our state's most vulnerable adults can receive the dental care that they need.\"\nA representative for Blue Cross did not respond to questions seeking comment about the proposed Medicaid dental contract changes.\nThere are 1.1 million children in the Healthy Kids Dental program, according to MDHHS.\nIf the proposal is approved by the Legislature, MDHHS would put out a request for proposals for a new Medicaid dental managed care contract after the 2023 fiscal year begins on Oct. 1, Hertel said.\nHertel didn't rule out having multiple health plans manage a single contract for Medicaid dental services.\n\"It could be, but we haven't begun establishing anything about the procurement yet and what we're actually looking for and what we're asking people to meet,\" Hertel said. \"But the important thing is it's pulling all of these populations into one contract, one procurement process instead of having separate ones.\"\nEditor's note: This Feb. 10 article was updated on Feb. 14 to include comment from Delta Dental of Michigan.",

We stand ready to work out the details with the mayor, as we have been throughout this process, the group's chair Harry Nespolli said.\nThe city's largest police union, which has sued the city over the mandate, said its officers dont deserve to be treated like second-class citizens.\nWe have been suing the city for months over its arbitrary and capricious vaccine mandate this is exactly what we are talking about. If the mandate isnt necessary for famous people, then its not necessary for the cops who are protecting our city in the middle of a crime crisis, said said its president, Pat Lynch.\nThe city last month fired more than 1,400 workerswho failed to comply with the vaccine mandate. The uneven application could likely invite more legal challenges over the mandate.\nAdams predecessor, Mayor Bill de Blasio, made vaccination mandatory as a workplace safety rule last year, before leaving office.\nJay Varma, a health advisor to de Blasio, said in a tweet that the mandate had legal standing because it applied to everyone.\n#VaccinesWork unless youre rich and powerful, in which case, #LobbyingWorks, Varma wrote. He added: The #KyrieCarveOut opens City up to entire scheme being voided by courts as arbitrary and capricious.\nAdams had said he felt the vaccine rule was unfair when it came to athletes and performers because a loophole in the measure, imposed under his predecessor, allowed visiting players and performers who dont work in New York to still play or perform even if they are unvaccinated.\nIrving, a vaccine holdout, had been among the most high-profile people impacted. He was able to re-join the team in Januarybut only when they played out of town games. When New York lifted rules several weeks ago requiring a vaccine to dine in a restaurant, work out at a gym or attend a performance, Iving was allowed to watch the Nets' home games but not play or enter the locker room.\nThe Nets need him as they push for a playoff spot with nine games left in their regular season.\nConcerns had been raised this that the rule would also impact Major League Baseball.\nYankees star Aaron Judge refused to directly answer a question about his vaccine statusearlier this month, leading to speculation that another New York team would be hobbled by a player's refusal to get inoculated.\nWhen asked Wednesday about the rule being lifted, Judge said he was happy Kyrie can play some home games.\nThe Yankees, who open their season at home against the Boston Red Sox on April 7, said earlier this month that the team president was working with city hall and all other appropriate officials on this matter. The Yankees declined comment Wednesday.\nNew York Mets owner Steve Cohen gave $1.5 million to a political action committee supporting Adams during his 2021 campaign. Adams is a Mets fan.\nAdams has been rolling back vaccine mandates and other coronavirus restrictions, including on Tuesday when he said masks could become optionalfor children under 5 starting April 4.\nMask mandates for older children have already been removed, as well as rules requiring people to show proof of vaccinationto dine in a restaurant, work out at a gym, attend a show, or go to an indoor sporting event.\nCopyright 2022 The Associated Press.

The order came after Animal Wellness Action and other wildlife groups filed a lawsuit to stop the hunt.\nCollins said his group has been following Facebook posts about killing wolves since the Trump administration delisted the wolf from the federal endangered species list in January. He pointed to the Wisconsin Wolf Hunting Facebook page, which include comments like smoke a pack a day.\nOther comments referred to the legal battles as games, and said the wolf population cant go unchecked and unmanaged.\nCollins acknowledged most people posting to the page are blowing smoke.\nEven if 0.1% of those turn out to be real, we think were doing our due diligence by putting the offer out there to get the information to the proper authorities, said Collins.\nState law in Wisconsin requires the state Department of Natural Resources to hold a wolf hunt from November through the end of February when the animal isnt under federal protections.\nAdam Jarchow pushed for the wolfs delisting and advocated for state wolf management as a former Republican state lawmaker. Jarchow, who is running for Wisconsin attorney general, said the comments illustrate peoples frustration with the growing number of wolves in Wisconsin and lack of a season.\nI suspect those people that are saying things are just saying it out of frustration, said Jarchow. Obviously, nobody should be breaking the law or killing wolves illegally. But it does illustrate the importance of having a regulated hunt so that we can control this predator.\nJarchow was among a group of Republican lawmakers from northern Wisconsin that proposed a bill that would block game wardens and police from investigating illegal wolf killings in the state in 2017.\nDNR spokesperson Sarah Hoye said the agency hasnt encountered any trend of illegal killings this fall.\nMeanwhile, we read and monitor all comments on the departments social media. We send any comment that mentions poaching to law enforcement for investigation, wrote Hoye in an email. Additionally, if someone mentions that they know of someone who is poaching, we encourage them to report the information they have via our violation hotline.\nThree wolves have been shot in the act of depredating a domestic animal this year, according to DNR officials. The wolves were shot in Price County in August and September. Since the wolfs delisting, landowners are allowed to shoot wolves in the act of biting, wounding or attacking their animals. Shootings must be reported to the DNR within 24 hours.\nAgency officials have said they havent had any recent reports of illegally killed wolves.\nIn February, state-licensed hunters killed 218 wolves in less than 72 hours, taking nearly double the wolves allowed under a 200-wolf quota.\nThe DNRs report on the February harvest found four wolves were illegally taken during the hunt, which were presented at registration. The agency detected 16 illegal killings of wolves from April 2019 to April 2020.\nResearch has shown that illegal kills account for around 9% of deaths each year. One study by University of Wisconsin-Madison researchers, found that around 100 wolves were killed on top of the 218 wolves that were harvested during the February wolf hunt.\nThe DNR encourages people to report any suspected violations to its violation hotline: 1-800-TIP-WDNR.",

            "text": "Telegram\nWashington: A recent study conducted by researchers at the University of Bonn suggests that the activity of individual nerve cells in the brain tells us how confident we are in our decisions.\nThe result is unexpected the researchers were actually on the trail of a completely different evaluation mechanism. The results are published in the journal Current Biology.\nEvery day humans have to make decisions. Researchers at the University Hospital Bonn have now identified nerve cells in the brain whose activity indicates the confidence in decisions.\nA total of twelve men and women took part in their experiment.\nWe showed them photos of two different snacks, for example a chocolate bar and a bag of chips. They were then asked to use a slider to indicate which of these alternatives they would rather eat, said Prof. Dr. Dr. Florian Mormann from the Department of Epileptology.\nThe more they moved the slider from its center position towards the left or right photo, the more confident they were in their decision.\nParticipants had to judge a total of 190 different snack pairs in this way. At the same time, the scientists recorded the activity of 830 nerve cells each in the so-called temporal lobe.\nWe discovered that the frequency of the electrical pulses in some neurons, in other words their firing rate, changed with increasing decision confidence, said Mormanns colleague Alexander Unruh-Pinheiro.\nFor instance, some fired more frequently, the more confident the respective test person was in their decision, added Pinheiro.\nIt is the first time that such a correlation between activity and decision confidence has been identified.\nThe affected neurons are located in a brain region that plays a role in memory processes.\nIt is possible that we not only store what decision we made, but also how confident we were in it. Perhaps such a learning process saves us from future wrong decisions, said Mormann.\nEthical reasons usually prohibit the study of the state of individual neurons in living humans. However, the participants in the study suffered from a severe form of epilepsy.\nIn this form of the disease, the characteristic seizures always start in the same area of the brain. One possible treatment is therefore to remove this epileptic focus surgically.\nTo pinpoint the exact location of the defective site, the doctors at the Clinic for Epileptology implant several electrodes in the patient. These are distributed over the entire potentially affected area.\nAt the same time, they also allow an insight into the functioning of individual nerve cells in the brain.\nResearchers at the University of Bonn were originally looking for a completely different phenomenon: When we make a decision, we assign a subjective value to each of the alternatives.\nThere is evidence that this subjective value is also reflected in the activity of individual neurons. The fact that we instead came across this connection between fire behavior and decision confidence surprised even us, said Mormann.\nTags",

It also brings additional concerns:\nEnvironment E-waste contains a long list of chemicals that are harmful to people and the environment.\nResources E-waste contains precious metals like gold and platinum, as well as elements like cobalt and neodymium. There is a finite supply of these resources and its dwindling rapidly.\nHuman rights E-waste is often illegally exported to countries that dont have applicable laws. Once stripped of valuable materials, the remainder is left to pollute the land, air and water of local citizens.\nData security Computing equipment makes up a large portion of the total e-waste produced. The data storage devices inside often contain sensitive information that can have significant detrimental effects when in the wrong hands.\nWhy do special interest groups, industry and governments care about e-waste?\nFor special interest groups, issues pertaining directly to them are always top-of-mind. Their activism serves as the catalyst for governments to take legislative action. Since organizations have a vested interest in the resulting laws, they prepare in advance for complying with the new regulations. The challenge then becomes convincing private citizens to comply with these laws and best practices.\nWhy should individuals care about e-waste?\nAs the world continues to get smaller, a regional issue can quickly develop into a global issue with far-reaching effects. This is especially true with e-waste:\nEnvironmental issues are more acutely felt as larger areas encounter tainted air, water and food.\nRare resources will only become scarcer and costlier to acquire.\nHuman rights violations will continue. Thankfully, the global economy provides new opportunities to enforce international law.\nData security is a major concern as we become more connected. Certified data destruction soon will be a necessity, but are there enough providers to do the job?\nWhat can I do to reduce e-waste?\nThe three keys to addressing e-waste are education, influence and action. Look for opportunities to make\nan impact at a grassroots level:\n1. Education Share your knowledge with others.\n2. Influence Model behavior that is conducive to solving e-waste problems.\n3. Action Take simple actions that make a huge difference.\nBuy only EPEAT registered products.\nBoycott companies that turn a blind eye to human rights violations.\nVote for lawmakers who embrace e-waste management.\nHelp develop e-waste policies in your organization.\nPatronize your local e-recycling company.\nThe question isnt if e-waste reduction and management will happen, its when. As our world becomes more polluted, natural resources dwindle, more people suffer social injustice and lives are ruined by data breaches, change will become a necessity.\nIf youre ready to make a difference in your world, check out SEDDs website and blog for ways you can help solve e-waste issues in your family, organization and community.\nAbout the Author\nChief Technology Officer and\nDirector of E-recycling, Sadoff E-Recycling & Data Destruction Co.\nChad Hayes is the chief technology officer and director of e-recycling at Sadoff E-Recycling & Data Destruction.

The Daily Record has since published an article about this case as it has meaningful impact on not just the Prince Georges County town but also for broader communities.\nMr. Ashkar, a Palestinian-American, became the owner of Gregs Towing in January of 2015. Greg's Towing is the only tow company in the Town of Riverdale Park in Prince Georges County and, for 30 years, it was the exclusive tow service provider for the town and its police department. Once Mr. Ashkar took over Greg's Towing, he contacted Town representatives, including the police dept., to continue the company's long standing relationship with the Town, but he was denied the by the Town, its employees and the police department through numerous instances that included derogatory language, name-calling and discriminatory statements.\nLocal government cannot discriminate against its citizens and this case is about fairness, justice and equality and this verdict speaks to that, Levi S. Zaslow told The Daily Record on Tuesday May 22\nnd\n.

(credit: REUTERS/ALESSANDRO BIANCHI)\nMekorots technologies improve the quality of water production and its consumption, and provide a myriad of benefits to the Israeli economy, while reducing the cost of living. They could also greatly improve the energy consumption, big data and cybersecurity sectors across the world, among other examples.\nFocusing on fiber optics, the water company developed a way to fish fiber optic lines throughout the country using its already existing pipeline infrastructure that stretches from the far reaches of the North back down to the southern borders. One of the recent projects that were dispatched was to connect the Negevs capital  the city of Beersheba  to Eilat, through a 280-km. pipeline.\nWe got the idea from the army, Mekorot chief technology officer Moti Shiri explained. The fiber optics are used by the army along the road to listen to noise stemming from long distances. Whether it be a car, people or animals, the technology can pick up and pinpoint the sounds from far away.\nWe didnt start this project for communication capabilities, our goal was to change the pipe to a smart pipe, Shiri said. We wanted to know in every centimeter or every inch of pipe what is happening in real time.\nThe fiber optics discovery ended up being just a plus to the equation, a plus that could save the Israeli economy and its citizens billions a year and countless hours of work in the process.\nThis makes it a prominent option to provide high-speed internet to the entirety of the country  especially sections that would otherwise not have access  at a lower cost than it would have originally been if the fiber optics cables were to be disseminated using non-existing infrastructure  infrastructure that would either have had to be commissioned or constructed from scratch.\nOur goal now is to connect the entirety of Israel to fiber optics, Shiri said. Not all of Israel is connected to fiber optics, and to connect them across the entire country costs a lot of money and takes a lot of time.\nShiri said that considering Mekorot has pipes all across the country  even in the remote sections  that by using the pipes, communications companies can connect to these remote areas quickly, instead of waiting three to four years to do it.\nIf the infrastructure would have had to have been built from scratch, it could cost the Israeli economy billions in construction, deployment, digging, permits and creating the overall infrastructure companies would need to house the fiber optic lines within. Additionally, as a separate plus, Mekorot forwards the option to use indoor facilities for the construction of a data center and Hub.\nMekorot itself, is the owner of more than 13,000 km. of existing and protected underground infrastructure throughout Israel, which constitutes as essential valuable real estate for a fiber network deployment  real estate which will all eventually be filled with fiber optic capabilities.\nTo disseminate the lines throughout the country, Mekorot fashioned a way to insert fiber optics cables into the pipelines and dispatch them throughout the country  2 km. at a time  using an innovative system that uses both water and air pressure to carry and transp",

As a result, the Bulldogs had built a substantial lead by the midway point of the second quarter 27-6.\nAs the game continued, Nyssa continued to maintain its early lead, even though the Tigers began to find their offensive rhythm in the second half.\nIn the third quarter, the Bulldogs had obtained a 40-16 lead over the Tigers, and extended their lead after a 17-3 offensive run midway through the quarter. As a result, Nyssa held onto a 57-19 lead.\nHowever, the Tigers began to claw into the Bulldogs lead by finding open teammates on the perimeter, along with holding the Bulldogs to 11 points for the remainder of the game. Although, the Tigers couldnt close the gap before the final buzzer, resulting in the conclusion of their season.\nSubsequently, Nyssa claimed victory over Clatskanie in the first round of the state tournament 68-41. As a result, the Bulldogs will travel to Coos Bay, Oregon, to compete against #10 Brookings-Harbor High School, at Marshfield High School, starting at 8:15 p.m. (PT).",

We are launching this industry-setting model right here in Michigan and plan to expand it nationally.\nJeff Radway, Green Peaks Innovation CEO\nWe are excited to launch 19 Skymint stores across Michigan within the next 18-24 months, said Joe Neller, executive vice president, Government Affairs & Business Development. We have carefully selected communities that are searching for a professional, best-in-class organization.\nThe new Skymint stores will feature high quality medical marijuana and marijuana products in a contemporary and inviting setting. The first locations of the 19 Michigan stores will be announced after the licenses are issued by the State of Michigan LARA Bureau of Medical Marihuana Regulation Board. The first store is expected to open in March 2019.\nWe have hired talented people from inside and outside the cannabis industry to produce, process and safeguard our Skymint harvest, said Molly VanSyckle, director of human resources. We have over 50 team members now and will grow to be more than 270 by the end of 2019.\nIn July 2018, Green Peak Innovations received pre-qualification by the LARA Bureau of Medical Marihuana Regulation for a full vertical suite of medical marijuana licenses including 12 class C cultivation licenses, one processor license and 19 provisioning center licenses. GPI was awarded two Class C cultivation licenses in October, ten additional Class C cultivation licenses in December, and anticipates receiving the remainder of the licenses over the next few months.\nThis month, our 60,000 square foot Windsor Township headquarters in Harvest Park will become fully operational and our first crop will be harvested, added Radway.

Dhanik joined the team before MySpace became a huge thing, and, from 2003 to 2008, he was the VP of strategic marketing. In 2009, he founded engage: BDR, a marketing company. And that helped him get to a net worth of $5 million as of 2022, and afford among many others a Bugatti Veyron.\nThe former MySpace executive shared a shot of my bug on his social media. He worked on the hypercar and on several other projects with RDB LA.\nIn 2005, Bugatti introduced the Veyronline, which lasted until 2011. It was the first production car that offered more than 1,000 horsepower. One can imagine, its price was up to measure. It was both exotic and powerful and came with the title of the fastest production car at the time. But, even today, you could find its name among the worlds fastest (the Veyron Super Sport version).\nThe German-then-French carmaker gave it an 8.0-liter W16 engine, mated to a 7-speed automatic double-clutch transmission. 987 horsepower (1,001 ps) and a maximum torque of 922 lb-ft (1,250 Nm) go to both axles. The Veyron is able to sprint to 62 (100 kph) from a standstill in 3.2 seconds and hits a top speed of 253 mph (407 kph).\nPainted in black and red on the outside, according to an older video from RDB LA the Veyron sports the same color scheme on board.\nAccording to Vik from RDB LA, Dhanik had purchased the Bugatti a few months ago, at the moment of their video, in March 2021. But, in a past interview with CelebMagazine he revealed he would only keep the car for a couple of years and then level up. So, who knows for how long he'll enjoy this dazzling ladybug?",

The round was led by BioX Clan, which specializes in early stage funding for new bioscience technologies. Other investors included Seerave Foundation and SOSV, which was following up on its pre-seed investment in BiomeSense via the biotech accelerator program, IndieBio.\nFounded in 2018, the Chicago, IL-based BiomeSense is revolutionizing human microbiome research by developing novel technologies to enable investigators to collect, store, and analyze the daily microbiome profiles of clinical trial participants in a low-cost, scalable way. By enabling daily profiling, the platform allows investigators the unprecedented ability to tie microbiome changes directly to clinical outcomes in real time, dramatically increasing the research discovery potential.\nThe human microbiome is the next frontier of precision medicine with enormous possibilities for improving our health, said Kevin Honaker, BiomeSense co-founder and CEO. Understanding how and why the microbiome changes over time is key to fully unlocking that potential, but today, getting continuous data at a reasonable cost is impossible.\nNow, thanks to the confidence of our funding and research partners, well be able to launch the first-ever solution to that problem in human trials next year.\nWere delighted to be leading BiomeSenses seed round, said Ho Joon Lee, CEO of BioX Clan. Their ground-breaking approach to continuous microbiome analysis has the potential to revolutionize the diagnostic use of microbiome data and bring tangible benefits to human health.\nWith the seed funding, BiomeSense will complete its prototype biosensor and data modeling platform in preparation for first clinical trials, scheduled for 2020. Those trials were oversubscribed within weeks of their availability, reflecting the widespread support BiomeSense has received from the research community since its launch from the Polsky Center at the University of Chicago.\nIndicating the breadth of the impact a better understanding of the gut microbiome can have on human health, those trials will investigate cancer progression, immunotherapy response, surgical recovery and athletic performance.\nWe have barely scratched the surface of understanding the power of the microbiome, said Dr. Jack Gilbert, BiomeSense co-founder and principal investigator. Recent work by the Human Microbiome Project and others has shown that to fully understand microbiomedisease interactions, we need large-scale studies that track microbiome changes over time, but until now we havent had the tools to make those possible.\nBiomeSense is developing an at-home biosensor to produce continuous gut microbiome data and a cloud-based analytics platform to turn that data into actionable clinical insights. The company provides this solution to scientists studying the microbiome, delivering dramatically more data over the course of a trial than currently available and enabling an unprecedented understanding of how short-term changes in the microbiome influence clinical outcomes.\n0",

Fewer overdoses occurred in rural areas, but the numbers still increased in 2020.\nKathryn Deuvel, Carris Health Addiction Serivces, Willmar\nIt was a wake-up call, said Deuvel, part of a team that started the Addiction Servicesprogram at the\nCarris Health-Willmar Main Clinic\nin April 2020.\nThe timing wasnt ideal, just after the pandemic started, said Holly Morales, a family practice physician assistant on the team.\nPeople didn't know what we had to offer, she said, but as people were referred to the program or heard about it on social media, the staff became increasingly busy.\nHolly Morales, Carris Health Addiction Services, Willmar\nThe program sees patients dealing with all kinds of substance use disorders, whether with opioids, alcohol, nicotine, methamphetamine or other other drugs.\nWillmar had not had a program offering medication-assisted treatment until Deuvel, Morales and Dr. Scott Abrams began it. Abrams works with Project Turnabout treatment programs in Granite Fallsand also works with inmates in the Stearns County Jailin St. Cloud Morales also works with Project Turnabout\nMedication-assisted treatment offering drugs that help curb cravings and reduce withdrawal symptoms can help prevent relapse and maintain abstinence, according to the\nU.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.\nA SAMHSA report lists the ability to offer medication-assisted treatment in primary care settings and not only specialized treatment programs as a key advantage.\nBefore the program in Willmar, people were driving two to three hours to see a doctor who prescribed their medication. The drugs are prescribed as part of a broad program that includes counseling and treatment.\nAddicts still need to work hard to find sobriety, said Abrams, who is a recovering addict himself.\nIm not going to give you the magical pill thats going to make you sober; I wanted that back in the day, Abrams said.\nDr. Scott Abrams, Carris Health Addiction Services, Willmar\nI would say to anyone, dont come into this thinking youre just going to take a pill and be fine, Abrams said. If you rely on a pill to change your behavior, you will fail every time.\nAbrams is in recovery from an addiction to opioid pain medication. Seven years ago, he lost his job as an emergency physician and his licenses to practice medicine and prescribe drugs.\nAfter he completed a treatment program, the clinic hired him to work in urgent care under close supervision. His licenses have since been restored, and his experiences led him to practice addiction medicine.\nBefore drugs like Suboxone or several others were available locally, some addicts tried to buy them on the streets, Deuvel said.\nThe trouble is theres no quality control from a drug dealer, she said.\nLike many other illegal drugs, they may have had fentanyl in them.\nFentanyl is a very strong drug and a big risk of overdose for people buying illegal drugs. Theres fentanyl in everything, Deuvel said.\nPatients will still have to work hard to overcome their addiction, Abrams said, and the program offers options for them.\nPatients can be referred to several outpatient treatment programs in the area.\nFor those who need to keep their jobs and are trying to keep their families intact, outpatient treatment is an option, he said.\nIt still requires a major commitment three nights a week, but they can stay in their community.\nInpatient treatment is another option.\nSome are worried about losing their jobs if they go to inpatient treatment. Abrams uses himself as an example and tells them that if they keep using, the job has a way of going away on its own.\nMorales said some patients come and go from the program. Some treatment programs in the past were strict with people whove started using again. In Willmar, the idea is to encourage them to try again.\nWhat we hope is they eventually find their way back to us, Morales said. Theyre so used to being chastised for missing appointments. ... Thats not what were about.\nMorales said she developed an interest in treating addiction after conversations with patients in her family practice about their substance use.\nPatients are thankful they can be treated in their local community and that they dont have to feel ashamed if they make a mistake and start using again, Deuvel said.\nIts a group of people who deserve way better treatment than communities and medical systems have given, she said. We dont shame people who have to take high blood pressure meds or have diabetes, why do we have to shame people with opioid addiction.\nThe idea that addicts are seeking quick pleasure is a misconception That part goes away pretty quickly, and then its the avoidance of the negative, Deuvel said.\nIts not a choice, either.\nIf you had your life controlled by a chemical that was hard to get, expensive and caused emotional trauma and shame for you and your family, would you choose to use that? she asked.\nAbrams said most people can come to some understanding of addiction through their own experiences.\nEverybodys got their thing they wish they didn't do that they keep doing, he said.\nIt might be something innocuous, like eating doughnuts or ice cream. The reward pathways in the brain are similar, regardless of the substance.\nIm not going to jail when I eat unhealthy food; its not the same thing, but thats how people can understand, he said.\nDeuvel was asked to develop the program by Dr. Cindy Firkins Smith, the former head of the clinic and now vice president of rural health for Carris Health's parent organization CentraCare\nSmith asked her to develop a thorough approach for dealing with the problem of opioid addiction and overdoses, Deuvel said.\nDeuvel spent many years at the clinic as an obstetrician/gynecologist. She delivered lots of babies How could you have a better job than that? but physical problems with her hands made it impossible for her to continue in that field.\nShe earned a masters degree in health care delivery and Smith asked her to come back to Willmar to work on quality innovations. For Deuvel, it felt like coming home.\nDeuvel said she looked at prevention, treatment and recovery, and found gaps in the system.\nWe developed a toolkit to help decrease the number of opioid prescriptions, she said.\nIts a balancing act, she said, of providing adequate treatment for pain while avoiding prescribing opioids wh",

            "text": "Email\nFew verticals are as vital or as global as the chemical industry, where the raw materials that cross borders find their way into everything from computer chips to potato chips. Shortages of those chemicals and bottlenecks in supply chains ultimately translate into shortages on shelves of everything from beauty products to paint cans.\nAnd yet, the chemical buying process itself, in which buyers connect with suppliers, place orders and get them fulfilled, is archaic and paper based. As ChemDirectCEO Tyler Ellisontold Karen Webster, Its extraordinarily opaque.\nIts a highly fragmented market, too, said Ellison, marked by $6 trillion in sales volume but where even major players have low single-digit market share.\nIts also marked by intermediaries including distributors, so transparency into end demand (and supply) is, to put it mildly, less than optimal. There are any number of causes of friction in the supply chain, said Ellison, tied to regulatory and political events everything from pandemics to production disruptions to tariffs.\nThe inefficient sales cycles can be improved considerably, he said, with two-sided automated, direct and digital marketplaces that bring buyers and sellers online in an experience that changes not just sourcing and price discovery, but the entire procurement process.\nThe urgency is there, and Ellison said ChemDirects genesis stems from his own time as CEO of a chemicals manufacturing company that led to frustration with lack of visibility into end markets and the multiple steps involved in getting orders in place.\nThe conversation came amid ChemDirects announcement earlier this month that it had launched version 2.0 of its website, with enhanced point, click and buy capabilities, as well as faster delivery speeds.\nIn terms of mechanics, as the platform is embedded into enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems via application programming interfaces (APIs), a chemical buyer can shop on the marketplace for the best pricing from verified chemical suppliers and manufacturers. The manufacturers, he said, are vetted (internally) by the platform (additional verification and security checks come from the payments partners).\nSuppliers are given a digital storefront at no cost, allowing buyers to shop directly and access those suppliers marketing materials and accreditation certificates. Along the way, he said, eliminating the distributors from the equation (and from the marketplace) allows those suppliers to build up their brands as they become known and trusted by the buyers.\nFinding the Tipping Point\nIn constructing the marketplace, which debuted last year and took six months to build, once wed reached that tipping point, the customer acquisition has been very good, said Ellison.\nHe added that the most recent enhancement of the site serves all manner of buyers and suppliers, from larger firms down to technical buyers (who scout for chemicals with different characteristics and even impurities) to occasional buyers who might be considered long tail users.\nThe companys platform also has payments functionality built in. Ellison noted that ChemDirect has partnered with Balance, a B2B payments firm, and Stripe to offer terms across a range of payments optionality, from ACH to cards. The payments functionality built into the platform allows payments to be staged based on certain milestones or approvals and receipts.\nAnd in a departure from what seems to be the fashion du jour no blockchain or cryptocurrencies are in the mix.\nThe Logistics Puzzle\nBeyond payments, Ellison said that one key failing of most B2B eCommerce sites centers on the fulfillment side of the equation. The average time till fulfillment in the chemicals space lasts anywhere from 12 to 20 weeks; the average fulfillment time with ChemDirect is three and a half days.\nOne of the of the things weve learned about institutional buyers is that they like a permission-based system, he said. If youre the procurement director, you might have 15,000 of monthly permissions to buy, and weve digitized that whole process. Knitting together a more digital value chain and skipping all those steps benefits everybody.\nThat shortened fulfillment time has positive ripple effects up and down supply chains as firms cut down on their inventory and re-ordering costs, he said.\nIn the future, the platform will continue to bring buyers and sellers together globally, with focus on the largest production regions in Asia, including India and China, and the largest consumption regions, marked by the U.S. and western Europe, he said.\nFurther advances in payments will be tied to continued efforts to understand the processes and constraints around foreign producers. As Ellison said: Some of them need prepayments, others do not. Still other firms can forward position inventory under a range of terms. We need to map out workflows before we overlay solutions.\nMonetizing the Data\nThe wealth of data accumulated on the platform across buyers and sellers can hint at changes in the market in the surpluses or shortages that loom. Case in point: Ellison recounted how in the early throes of the pandemic, isopropyl alcohol (and all the things that go into it) saw spikes in demand in the thousands of percentage points. In March of last year, ChemDirect was among the only places that had access to isopropyl alcohol. Passing the demand data along to the manufacturer allowed it to adjust its production.\nWe consider ourselves the demand scouts of the industry, he said, with data that may be, eventually, monetized while creating a B2C experience in a B2B marketplace.",

Aging Baby Boomers-the Silver Tsunami want to age differently than their grandparents did, says Schonbrun.

NYC design firm Pembrooke & Ives and local developer Trammel Crow collaborated with Balfour on the 138-unit building featuring penthouses, a swimming pool, theatre and no large buy-in fees.\nNative Content\nA successful career as CEO of National Jewish Hospital and government nursing home regulator didnt come close to preparing Michael Schonbrun for the challenges of relocating his then recently widowed mother Madeline from the familys NYC apartment to senior living. The lessons learned from that journey is the origin story behind the soon-to-be-built Balfour at Palisades.\nQuality is our standard says Schonbrun, CEO of Balfour Senior Living, a collection of boutique senior living communities.

Of these, ten units are part of D.C.s Inclusionary Zoning program and are income restricted. Residents will have the convenience of a range of services centered around their lifestyle and needs from independent living to assisted living, and memory care. The amenities include seasonally inspired culinary offerings at breakfast, lunch and dinner, seven days a week in three dining venues, indoor saltwater pool, sauna, fitness center and yoga studio, hair salon, theatre, a library, bar, housekeeping and home maintenance services, valet parking for residents and their guests, reserved covered parking, rooftop access and a Tesla fleet staffed with Balfour drivers to meet scheduled or spontaneous local transportation needs.\nThe Balfour at Palisades community spaces feature exceptional quality architecture, dcor and art where future residents can proudly welcome their families and friends.  The bar evokes the mood of some of DCs iconic clubs and restaurants.\nBalfours model does not have a large buy-in fee, instead charging monthly rent plus a la carte levels of care when or if needed. Its a model that requires Balfour to earn your trust every day and allow for flexibility should a relocation or changed life circumstances arise. Additionally, couples can stay together with care brought into their apartment home if needed.\nFor Michael Schonbrun and his partner Susan Juroe, a Georgetown resident for 20 years, Balfour represents a personal calling. We wanted to create places where residents can welcome their friends and families and enjoy wonderful experiences together. The Palisades is designed for ease of living and engagement within and beyond our community. Residents can enjoy all that the Palisades neighborhood offers  only steps away from their front door  and all that the Washington, D.C.  area has to offer. Another plus: Balfour is pet friendly. Residents can move in with their pets and Its common for some pet-less residents to adopt pets after theyve settled in. Balfour at Palisades will feature an indoor off-leash pet park and a pet grooming station.\nThe silver tsunami is nowhere close to cresting according to AARP and other senior advocacy groups. Baby Boomers (sorry, Millennials!) are still making their influence known in all sorts of ways. To be honest, we designed Balfour for ourselves. And for Madeline, of course! Michael admits. We thought seriously of what we would like and need to feel comfortable, what it meant to feel at home and have that pride of place  thats something were always working on. Susan adds, Were also mindful of the challenges people are facing as they age. Loneliness, depression, and lack of physical, mental, and emotional stimulation are real health hazards. At Balfour, were creating communities where everyone can feel valued and welcome and are free to discover new interests and friendships.\nLocal architects Perkins Eastman took inspiration from the art deco buildings in the Palisades as well as the grand historic residential buildings in Washington, DC to create a design compatible with the neighborhood. Balfour at Palisades is set to open in 2023.\nBalfour at Palisades will be located at 4865 MacArthur Blvd NW, D.C. 20007 and is expected to open in 2023. The leasing center address is 4418 MacArthur Blvd., NW. For more details or to schedule a meeting at their leasing center contact Eileen Alexander, Executive Director,",

            "text": "Email\nIllustration by Alex Castro / The Verge\nMIT and Harvards Broad Institute was the first to apply the gene-editing tool CRISPR to human cells, the US Patent and Trademark Office said Monday The decision stymies years of efforts from the University of California, Berkeley to obtain lucrative patent rights to the technology. UC Berkeley is home to Jennifer Doudna, who won a 2020 Nobel Prizewith Emmanuelle Charpentier for discovering the CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing technique.\nIt also complicatesthe work of some biotech companies to develop gene-editing therapies based on CRISPR: many, including companies like Caribou Biosciences (co-founded by Doudna) and Intellia Therapeutics, which licensed the CRISPR tech from the UC Berkeley group.\nThis decision once again confirmed Broads patents were properly issued, Broad Institute said in a statement. Broad believes that all institutions should work together to ensure wide, open access to this transformative technology.\nThe UC Berkeley group, collectively referred to as CVC, said in a statementthat it intends to challenge the decision. The group holds dozens of other CRISPR-related patents.\nThe decision is likely an end to a long-running fightover ownership of the gene-editing technique, which revolutionized genetic research and biotech. It lets scientists easily and precisely cut and and reorder bits of DNA, changing the way it codes for different functions. Doudna and her colleagues published the first paper on the CRISPR system in 2012, showing how it worked in a test tube. Then, in 2013, researchers at the Broad Institute published a paper on using CRISPR in the types of cells found in animals and people.\nBoth institutions filed for patents, and the US Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) initially awarded CRISPR patents to the Broad Institute in 2014. UC Berkeley contested the decision, and the PTO determinedin 2017 that the patents from the two institutions were different enough that they could both stand  and that the Broad Institute retained patents, potentially worth billions for the use of CRISPR in complex human and animal cells. UC Berkeley appealedto the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, DC, and lost that appeal\nThe ruling Monday was the result of another challengeUC Berkeley put before the Patent Trial and Appeal Board in 2019, pitting different CVC patents against the Broad Institutes patents. Once again, the PTO sided with the Broad Institute.\nBiotech companies that initially licensed technology from CVC will likely have to renegotiate with the Broad Institute. Companies that licensed from the Broad Institute, like genome editing company Editas Medicine, are more secure. The decision reaffirms the strength of our foundational intellectual property as we continue our work to develop life-changing medicines for people living with serious diseases, Editas CEO James Mullen said in a statement\nNext Up In\nSign up for the                  newsletter\nVerge Deals\nSubscribe to get the best Verge-approved tech deals of the week.\nJust one more thing!\nPlease confirm your subscription to Verge Deals via the verification email we just sent you.\nEmail\n(required)\nBy signing up, you agree to our Privacy Noticeand European users agree to the data transfer policy.\nSubscribe",

Developing innovative software is one thing but tech startups often lack the financial heft to venture into the somewhat dicey hardware side of the equation.\nIn akin's case, related to home hubs, ambient computing and hopefully, further down the line - robotic helpers.\nFor LG, the feeling is mutual as Dr. Sokwoo Rhee, senior vice president for innovation at LG Electronics and head of LG NOVA explains:\nWhen you develop technology with a clear vision and a clear goal, which is going to bring real value to people, thats when its going to have the highest impact.\nToo few companies have this type of vision from the outset while also being fully aligned with the philosophy of our challenge. Thats where we feel akin is different.\nOver the long-term, akin is passionate about hosting its sophisticated high-end chatbot inside a robot, whatever shape that might take, to provide physical support.\nAddressing the greatest need\nFor now, the priority remains in creating a software interface with the intention of easing the cognitive load on family caregivers. The company is adopting a universal design approach by initially honing in on disability use cases.\nRight now, a typical scenario might be that of Emily  a girl with cerebral palsy and mild intellectual impairment.\nEmilys mom might tell the AI that Emily wants to be more independent but is often late for school because she struggles to pack her school bag every day. She also has to be careful, as the bag cant be too heavy on account of her disability.\nThis goal will be relayed to Emilys personal avatar on her tablet who she has specially chosen to have long blue hair. The interface has also been rendered with large buttons to help her navigate better.\nEmilys avatar talks to her differently from mom when she is rushed off her feet in the morning getting the kids to school. Her assistant will remind her to pack her school bag the night before and be careful not to make it too heavy.\nAt the same time, Emilys older brother Jack is reminded by his avatar that its his turn to cook the dinner tomorrow night and the meal plan says its going to be vegetable pasta.\nThe akin interface\nakin\nLiesl Yearsley is CEO of akin and a world-leading artificial intelligence expert. She has founded three successful companies, including Cognea Artificial Intelligence, which was later acquired by IBM Watson.\nTwo of her children live with a disability.\nThe emotional load and level of organizational labor facing families living with a disability are significant, says Yearsley.\nIts around 10-15 hours a week. That is the key problem area we are working on with our software. We want to build an ambient, centralized AI that understands the goals of the family and individual, has empathy and can actualize as well.\nYearsley continues, We feel, in these early days, that we can manage much of this organizational load with software but when the technology gets there, we will have a physical assistance mode too.\nChanging expectations\nAcross wider society, there exists a rapidly expanding business case for help with managing domestic tasks and family affairs, that may not have existed, or at least not been fully appreciated, in previous decades.\nSometimes, when Ive engaged with the investment community  what I hear the most is  I just dont get the problem, says Yearsley.\nThis is because most of them have a chef, a housekeeper, nannies for the kids - a whole entourage that supports their household.But thats not how most of us live. Most people are cutting a 20-40 hour a week job in addition to what has to be done at home.\nFor the last couple of decades, the economics around this type of innovation might not have worked. But what's happening now is 72% of millennials are working parents and millennials are now the largest living generation.\nToday, its not like grandma's time where there is somebody unpaid doing this housework and it not being viewed as an economic cost. We now have this more vocal generation coming through with clearer ideas about the value of their time, says Yearsley.\nWhile the age of the robot butlers or even the super-intelligent Ai voice assistants living in the walls might not yet be upon us, its already a frontier opening up due to the innate desire of us as humans to innovate and explore.\nThats not to forget, the more modern era trend to want to make what we see in sci-fi movies come true in real life.\nThere are many hard yards to cover before we get there but understanding how to interweave technology into the granular and unique dynamics of individual family units seems like the perfect place to start.\nFollow me on",

Before the pandemic, Dr. Kathryn Deuvel said, she thought west central Minnesota might be turning a corner on the number of overdose deaths.\nBut with the pandemic drug overdoses and deaths in the region and across the country went right back up.\nMinnesotas overdose deaths had decreased in 2018, the numbers rebounded to previous levels in 2019 and skyrocketed in 2020 after the pandemic lockdowns began. Fewer overdoses occurred in rural areas, but the numbers still increased in 2020.\nKathryn Deuvel, Carris Health Addiction Serivces, Willmar\nIt was a wake-up call, said Deuvel, part of a team that started the Addiction Servicesprogram at the\nCarris Health-Willmar Main Clinic\nin April 2020.\nThe timing wasnt ideal, just after the pandemic started, said Holly Morales, a family practice physician assistant on the team.\nPeople didn't know what we had to offer, she said, but as people were referred to the program or heard about it on social media, the staff became increasingly busy.\nHolly Morales, Carris Health Addiction Services, Willmar\nThe program sees patients dealing with all kinds of substance use disorders, whether opioids, alcohol, nicotine, methamphetamine or other other drugs.\nWillmar had not had a program offering medication-assisted treatment until Deuvel, Morales and Dr. Scott Abrams began it. Abrams works with Project Turnabout treatment programs in Granite Falls and also works with inmates in the Stearns County Jail in St. Cloud. Morales also works with Project Turnabout.\nMedication-assisted treatment offering drugs that help curb cravings and reduce withdrawal symptoms can help prevent relapse and maintain abstinence, according to the\nU.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.\nA SAMHSA report lists the ability to offer medication-assisted treatment in primary care settings and not only specialized treatment programs as a key advantage.\nBefore the program in Willmar, people were driving two to three hours to see a doctor who prescribed their medication. The drugs are prescribed as part of a broad program that includes counseling and treatment.\nAddicts still need to work hard to find sobriety, said Abrams, who is a recovering addict.\nIm not going to give you the magical pill thats going to make you sober; I wanted that back in the day, Abrams said.\nDr. Scott Abrams, Carris Health Addiction Services, Willmar\nI would say to anyone, dont come into this thinking youre just going to take a pill and be fine, Abrams said. If you rely on a pill to change your behavior, you will fail every time.\nAbrams is in recovery from an addiction to opioid pain medication. Seven years ago, he lost his job as an emergency physician and his licenses to practice medicine and prescribe drugs.\nAfter he completed a treatment program, the clinic hired him to work in urgent care under close supervision. His licenses have since been restored, and his experiences led him to practice addiction medicine.\nBefore drugs like Suboxone or several others were available locally, some addicts tried to buy them on the streets, Deuvel said.\nThe trouble is theres no quality control from a drug dealer, she said.\nLike many other illegal drugs, they may have had fentanyl in them.\nFentanyl is a very strong drug and a big risk of overdose for people buying illegal drugs. Theres fentanyl in everything, Deuvel said.\nPatients will still have to work hard to overcome their addiction, Abrams said, and the program offers options for them.\nPatients can be referred to several outpatient treatment programs in the area.\nFor those who need to keep their jobs and are trying to keep their families intact, outpatient treatment is an option, he said.\nIt still requires a major commitment three nights a week, but they can stay in their community.\nInpatient treatment is another option.\nSome are worried about losing their jobs if they go to inpatient treatment. Abrams uses himself as an example and tells them that if they keep using, the job has a way of going away on its own.\nMorales said some patients come and go from the program. Some treatment programs in the past were strict with people whove started using again. In Willmar, the idea is to encourage them to try again.\nWhat we hope is they eventually find their way back to us, Morales said. Theyre so used to being chastised for missing appointments. ... Thats not what were about.\nMorales said she developed an interest in treating addiction after conversations with patients in her family practice about their substance use.\nPatients are thankful they can be treated in their local community and that they dont have to feel ashamed if they make a mistake and start using again, Deuvel said.\nIts a group of people who deserve way better treatment than communities and medical systems have given, she said. We dont shame people who have to take high blood pressure meds or have diabetes, why do we have to shame people with opioid addiction.\nThe idea that addicts are seeking quick pleasure is a misconception That part goes away pretty quickly, and then its the avoidance of the negative, Deuvel said.\nIts not a choice, either.\nIf you had your life controlled by a chemical that was hard to get, expensive and caused emotional trauma and shame for you and your family, would you choose to use that, she asked.\nAbrams said most people can come to some understanding of addiction through their own experiences.\nEverybodys got their thing they wish they didn't do that they keep doing, he said.\nIt might be something innocuous, like eating doughnuts or ice cream. The reward pathways in the brain are similar, regardless of the substance.\nIm not going to jail when I eat unhealthy food, its not the same thing, but thats how people can understand, he said.\nDeuvel was asked to develop the program by Dr. Cindy Firkins Smith, the former head of the clinic and now vice president of rural health for Carris Health's parent organization CentraCare.\nSmith asked her to develop a thorough approach for dealing with the problem of opioid addiction and overdoses, Deuvel said.\nDeuvel spent many years at the clinic as an obstetrician/gynecologist. She delivered lots of babies How could you have a better job than that? but physical problems with her hands made it impossible for her to continue in that field.\nShe earned a masters degree in health care delivery and Smith asked her to come back to Willmar to work on quality innovations. For Deuvel, it felt like coming home.\nDeuvel said she looked at prevention, treatment and recovery and found gaps in the system.\nWe developed a toolkit to help decrease the number of opioid prescriptions, she said.\nIts a balancing act, she said, of providing adequate treatment for pain while avoiding prescribing opioids whe",

            "text": "Email\nFew verticals are as vital or as global as the chemical industry, where the raw materials that cross borders find their way into everything from computer chips to potato chips. Shortages of those chemicals and bottlenecks in supply chains ultimately translate into shortages on shelves of everything from beauty products to paint cans.\nAnd yet, the chemical buying process itself, in which buyers connect with suppliers, place orders and get them fulfilled, is archaic and paper based. As ChemDirectCEO Tyler Ellisontold Karen Webster, Its extraordinarily opaque.\nIts a highly fragmented market, too, said Ellison, marked by $6 trillion in sales volume but where even major players have low single-digit market share.\nIts also marked by intermediaries including distributors, so transparency into end demand (and supply) is, to put it mildly, less than optimal. There are any number of causes of friction in the supply chain, said Ellison, tied to regulatory and political events everything from pandemics to production disruptions to tariffs.\nThe inefficient sales cycles can be improved considerably, he said, with two-sided automated, direct and digital marketplaces that bring buyers and sellers online in an experience that changes not just sourcing and price discovery, but the entire procurement process.\nThe urgency is there, and Ellison said ChemDirects genesis stems from his own time as CEO of a chemicals manufacturing company that led to frustration with lack of visibility into end markets and the multiple steps involved in getting orders in place.\nThe conversation came amid ChemDirects announcement earlier this month that it had launched version 2.0 of its website, with enhanced point, click and buy capabilities, as well as faster delivery speeds.\nIn terms of mechanics, as the platform is embedded into enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems via application programming interfaces (APIs), a chemical buyer can shop on the marketplace for the best pricing from verified chemical suppliers and manufacturers. The manufacturers, he said, are vetted (internally) by the platform (additional verification and security checks come from the payments partners).\nSuppliers are given a digital storefront at no cost, allowing buyers to shop directly and access those suppliers marketing materials and accreditation certificates. Along the way, he said, eliminating the distributors from the equation (and from the marketplace) allows those suppliers to build up their brands as they become known and trusted by the buyers.\nFinding the Tipping Point\nIn constructing the marketplace, which debuted last year and took six months to build, once wed reached that tipping point, the customer acquisition has been very good, said Ellison.\nHe added that the most recent enhancement of the site serves all manner of buyers and suppliers, from larger firms down to technical buyers (who scout for chemicals with different characteristics and even impurities) to occasional buyers who might be considered long tail users.\nThe companys platform also has payments functionality built in. Ellison noted that ChemDirect has partnered with Balance, a B2B payments firm, and Stripe to offer terms across a range of payments optionality, from ACH to cards. The payments functionality built into the platform allows payments to be staged based on certain milestones or approvals and receipts.\nAnd in a departure from what seems to be the fashion du jour no blockchain or cryptocurrencies are in the mix.\nThe Logistics Puzzle\nBeyond payments, Ellison said that one key failing of most B2B eCommerce sites centers on the fulfillment side of the equation. The average time till fulfillment in the chemicals space lasts anywhere from 12 to 20 weeks; the average fulfillment time with ChemDirect is three and a half days.\nOne of the of the things weve learned about institutional buyers is that they like a permission-based system, he said. If youre the procurement director, you might have 15,000 of monthly permissions to buy, and weve digitized that whole process. Knitting together a more digital value chain and skipping all those steps benefits everybody.\nThat shortened fulfillment time has positive ripple effects up and down supply chains as firms cut down on their inventory and re-ordering costs, he said.\nIn the future, the platform will continue to bring buyers and sellers together globally, with focus on the largest production regions in Asia, including India and China, and the largest consumption regions, marked by the U.S. and western Europe, he said.\nFurther advances in payments will be tied to continued efforts to understand the processes and constraints around foreign producers. As Ellison said: Some of them need prepayments, others do not. Still other firms can forward position inventory under a range of terms. We need to map out workflows before we overlay solutions.\nMonetizing the Data\nThe wealth of data accumulated on the platform across buyers and sellers can hint at changes in the market in the surpluses or shortages that loom. Case in point: Ellison recounted how in the early throes of the pandemic, isopropyl alcohol (and all the things that go into it) saw spikes in demand in the thousands of percentage points. In March of last year, ChemDirect was among the only places that had access to isopropyl alcohol. Passing the demand data along to the manufacturer allowed it to adjust its production.\nWe consider ourselves the demand scouts of the industry, he said, with data that may be, eventually, monetized while creating a B2C experience in a B2B marketplace.",

            "text": "LinkedIn\nWhen Melissa Chan was 18 years old, her father went missing again. It had happened four years earlier, but this time he'd been gone for two days. His dementia had gotten worse.\nWe stayed in Woodlands. My mum had dropped him off at his office at Potong Pasir, and when she went to pick him up, she couldnt find him and started panicking, Melissa recalled. There was no Facebook. We had to SMS everyone, and the police followed the missing persons protocol, which meant waiting for 24 hours.\nMelissa Chan with her siblings and her father. (Photo: Melissa Chan)\nHer father was eventually found sitting on a sofa a few blocks from their home he had somehow managed to find his way to the neighbourhood, but not quite home.\nWhen I think about it, I can imagine how painful and confused he was sitting there. When I saw him at the police station, his shirt was tucked out and he had lost his shoes, said Melissa. The sofa he was sitting in was the same colour as the one we used to have.\nProject We Forgot founder and Homage's head of community and outreach Melissa Chan at the latter's office. (Photo: Alvin Teo)\nThat incident, along with many others as she, her siblings and their mother struggled to care for her father, would eventually prompt the 28-year-old Singaporean to start a social enterprise for dementia caregivers and, later, join an even bigger start-up with bigger aspirations.\nGIVING SUPPORT FOR CAREGIVERS\nFounded shortly after Melissa's father passed away in 2014, the much-lauded Project We Forgothas been actively functioning as a kind of support group for caregivers of persons with dementia, through online forums, workshops and other activities.\nMelissa Chan with volunteers and members of Project We Forgot. (Photo: Project We Forgot>\nIt was community that her family didnt have back then. As a family, we never spoke about it. My mother was struggling to figure out what was happening to her husband, and care for us, said Melissa. Id cancel appointments with friends because I felt a sense of guilt. I decided not to go overseas for education because a part of me worried that my father would forget who I was when I came back.\nOne lightbulb moment to start PWF would also come from an unlikely source: Comedian Seth Rogen.\nHes seen as someone super funny but I saw him speaking in (US) Congress about dementia his wifes mother had it and the two of them had to care for her. I was very impressed because he was using a different way to educate them about the condition, and the struggles of caregivers,\" she said.\n\"I realised there was nothing like that in Singapore. When you Google, you see Western faces. Any information was very medical, and research papers. But its a very human journey.\"\nStarting PWF entailed a sharp career detour. Melissa had previously worked in the hospitality and tech industries (in marketing and communications for W Hotels and later, a travel tech start-up) but both experiences proved crucial.\nI realised that at the end of the day, its about taking (complicated information) and making it accessible for people to digest.\nShe and her PWF team turned to social media after discovering there were caregivers overseas who were using Instagram as a platform. They were sharing stories, talking about day-to-day experiences, videoing themselves about their struggles.\nAnd it worked. Today, PWF continues to organise activities in Singapore (most recently a dementia-friendly design-a-thon at the National Design Centre) and they are aiming to grow in Malaysia, where theyre holding a film event in time for World Alzheimers Month this September. Alzheimer's contributes a large percentage to cases of dementia, which is an umbrella term, said Melissa.\nThey have have also gotten support from organisations like the National Youth Council, Alzheimer's Disease Association and Singtel, which had named it one of its Future Makers start-up companies in 2017.\nCONNECTING CAREGIVERS AND THE ELDERLY\nBut PWF was just the start of her advocacy. Early this year, Melissa also joined Homage another local start-up that is also expanding to Malaysia, which helps connect caregivers with the elderly and their family.\nI decided not to go overseas for education because a part of me worried that my father would forget who I was when I came back.\nFor Melissa, whos now also head of Homages community and outreach, it was a chance to offer something that PWF could not.\nWeve been doing the emotional well-being support (for caregivers at PWF) and now, Homage has a platform to provide on-demand care (for patients).\nIn a nutshell, said Melissa, it's something like Grab but for elderly care.\nThe company has a pool of care professionals, or \"Care Pros\", that people can tap into by using an app or going online, whether its to send a loved one for a medical check-up or simply to look after them at home.\nProject We Forgot founder Melissa Chan is now also head of community and outreach at Homage, which connects caregivers with the elderly. (Photo: Alvin Teo)\nTHE IMPORTANCE OF TECHNOLOGY\nIt might seem strange to be bringing up technology when talking about an issue where physical, human interaction is whats most vital, but Melissa says being connected has actually become crucial as the population ages and families become smaller and often busy at work.\nThere is a need to shift the way care is delivered, especially if youre looking at the topic of longterm care for an ageing population, she said. If a family needs a caregiver in the next two days, can they get it or do they wait two to three weeks, for example.\nWhenever I think of services at Homage, I think about how my family couldve used it just a few hours to ensure that someone was home to watch over my dad.\nOn top of that, people who are tech-savvy will want information at their fingertips its no longer just putting a parent in a nursing home or with a caregiver and not knowing whats happening for a few hours. Just knowing how your parent is doing there is a big role for technology to play in this space,\" said Melissa.\nFor example, being connected means one can be updated on how the medical appointment or house visit went without being physically there. And the Care Pros, too, can access previous information about the client-patient through the app so theyre prepared before even entering the home.\nThe Homage app lets you book a caregiver for your family member. (Photo: Homage)\nThe current pool of Care Pros number around 1,000, which is a mix of nurses, therapists and non-nurses who are able to provide support. And theyre in-demand. Every hour were delivering care right now, Melissa told CNA Lifestyle.\nJoining Homage also resonated with Melissa on a very personal level.\nWhile taking care of her father, there were times when the familys schedules wouldnt sync and they had to sometimes resort to locking him up at home.\nIt was dangerous and we knew it wasnt the right thing to do, but it was our only option sometimes, she said, sadly.\nMelissa C",

The three-day art and lifestyle fair welcomed a fairly good number of visitors on its opening day. A celebration of the theme, Free Your Mind, the fair is showcasing a range of artworks and experiences across a range of different styles, with works of 120+ solo artists and galleries from 20+ countries.\nAfter months of virtual exhibitions and Zoom openings, the artists, buyers, organisers, and visitors, had a field day out, as they attended the events for the day, including live art walks and painting sessions. In addition, the visitors took part in various workshops like learning button mosaic and paper collage skills. The three curators, incidentally all women, Batool Jafri, Samar Kamel, and Petra Kaltenbach, expressed their happiness and hope at the response, \"Until this noon, we were not sure of what to expect but within 20 minutes of the opening, we were certain of the event's success.\"\nAmong the many new features, this year are the digital art display, Urban Art DXB and a dedicated zone for sculptures and photographers. A wall with psychedelic colours, inspired by Alexa Meade and curated by Batool and Samar, a perfect Instagram friendly space to sit and get clicked was one of the most-visited (and sanitised, each time a person sat and left!) spot on day one! With only one or two visitors allowed in the art booths at a time, and floor stickers with words like, \"Social Distancing Expert\" and \"Wear your masks at all times,\" it was remarkable to note how the fair kept responsibility at its core mission.\nFor those looking to invest in art or simply adorn their homes with canvases, there are ample choices to select from works ranging in prices between $100 - $20,000. \"World Art Dubai remains an extremely innovative show that embraces every corner of the art world. We are leading the region's charge for the restart of events and have curated a show that embraces the latest trends while celebrating art traditions,\" said Trixie LohMirmand, Executive Vice President, Exhibitions  &  Events Management, DWTC.\nAll the venue entry points are equipped with thermal scanning, along with smart cameras to ensure social distancing protocols. The venue is getting regularly sanitised and hand sanitisers are available throughout the venue. All visitors are required to wear a mask at all times. The event is on until Saturday (1 pm to 9 pm), visitors can pre-book their tickets worldartdubai.com.\nA year of creativity and opportunity\nA. P. Laitu, one of the participating artists at World Art Expo 2020, said that this has been an unprecedented year in the history of mankind and did not even leave the art world untouched.\nHe added that at the same the year would be remembered as a year of creativity and opportunity. \"It gave us all ample time to create some good art.\" He shared that he is grateful to World Art Dubai for giving the artists the much-awaited platform to showcase their creativity and also meet and greet fellow artists from all over the world. \"This platform is also the evaluation of how constructively we all have spent our time during this period of lockdown and isolation.\"\nWhat is arty-fash style statement?\nIndividuality is the key, and while many of us wish to make a personal statement, we find it hard to express ourselves via colours, shapes and images. At Artify Station by multi-disciplinary artist Ella Orencillo, you can get a bespoke pair of shoes, a cap or a cloth bag, as the artist helps you define your style.\nElla, a Filipino, has been in Dubai for 13 years now. She quit her job in 2017 to be a full-time artist and started her company, Craftology, last year. \"I'd been pursuing art on the side, all this while though, as I worked as a receptionist, personal assistant, executive assistant, etc.\" She hand-painted a bag with Khaleej Times written in signature blue colour. \"People want to be different and have good ideas, but are unable to translate the same visually.

The magic of #photogrammetry, 3D Scanning, & many cameras @MadMaxGame. pic.twitter.com/gIjzC3zM54 WENDY W FOK |  (@W_W_F) February 7, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tweet shows digital researcher Wendy W. Fox at Avalanches New York offices, having her face scanned using photogrammetry cameras, for what she describes as Mad Max 2.\n\n\n\nThe photo was apparently taken before the pandemic but other than stating that her face would have been used for a rebel character theres no information on what the game is and whether its still in development.\n\n\n\nIt is possible she may have been mistaken about what game she was been scanned for, as Avalanche also worked on the Mad Max-esque Rage 2. However, that was released in May 2019 and so unless shes underplaying how much earlier this was before the pandemic started, it doesnt seem likely that it was that.\n\n\n\n3D scanning technology was not used for the original Mad Max, in fact its poor quality character models were a notable flaw, so it does make sense that it would be something that Avalanche would want to improve in a sequel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheres also recently been talk of a new Mad Max film, a prequel focusing on the Furiosa character from Fury Road, thats supposed to start production this year.\n\n\n\nThat would certainly be a good reason to start work on a new game and while the tweet doesnt make any claim that the sequel is still in development  so it could have been cancelled  its certainly enough to remain hopeful.\n\n\n\nAvalanche is currently working on Xbox console exclusive Contraband for Microsoft but theyre big enough to have two major games in production at once, with the original Mad Max releasing the same year as Just Cause 3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail gamecentral@metro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter.\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\tMORE : Fortnite leaks point to Mad Max crossover following Season 7 finale\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\tMORE : Mad Max review  Fallout on wheels\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\tMORE : Mad Max preview and interview  Australian U-turn\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\nFollow Metro Gaming on Twitter and email us at gamecentral@metro.co.uk\n\n\n\nFor more stories like this,check our Gaming page.",

            "text": "In this June 6, 2017, file photo, a reporter holds up an example of the amount of fentanyl that can be deadly after a news conference about deaths from fentanyl exposure, at DEA Headquarters in Arlington, Va.\nCredit: Jacquelyn Martin / AP\nRare drugs designed to mimic the opioid fentanyl are showing up more often in urine samples from Penobscot County than any other county in the nation, according to a recent study. The findings are concerning to the authors, they said, since they come at a time when the fentanyl analogs are frequently being added to methamphetamine, creating a deadly combination.\nIn the study published in the Drug and Alcohol Dependence journal, the authors analyzed 300,000 urine drug tests from July 15, 2019, through March 12, 2020. Health professionals from all 50 states submitted urine samples to Millennium Health LLC, a commercial laboratory based in San Diego, to have them tested as part of patients routine care. The vast majority  295,647  had not been prescribed fentanyl for medical purposes.\nThe studys authors, who are all employees of Millennium Health, found that, of those patients testing positive for fentanyl without a fentanyl prescription, 40.55 percent had at least one fentanyl analog detected in their system, showing that copycat fentanyl is absolutely infiltrating the market for illicit substances, said Joseph Stanton, associate director of clinical affairs at Millennium Health and one of the studys authors.\nFentanyl analogs are usually produced in clandestine laboratories and, while they are chemically similar to fentanyl, they were specifically engineered to skirt U.S. law though the U.S. later banned them China is the principal source of fentanyl analogs, which has routed the drugs through the mail and Mexico, according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.\nSome drug dealers mix fentanyl analogs with other drugs, such as heroin, cocaine and methamphetamine. Mixing is cheaper for dealers because it takes only a small amount of a fentanyl analog to produce a high. However, its far riskier for users who dont always know what they are getting, evidenced by the fact that, in Maine, the average drug overdose death in 2019 involved three drugs Different analogs have different potencies, and they are not all well understood or well studied.\nOne well-known analog, however, is carfentanil, which, at 100 times the potency of fentanyl, was originally designed to sedate large animals such as elephants and moose. About 20 microgramsof carfentanil, which is less than a grain of salt, is enough to kill someone.\nOf the no-prescription, fentanyl-positive urine samples in the study, the counties that saw the highest positivity rates for more frequently found analogs such as carfentanil and acetyl fentanyl were in Kentucky and Ohio.\nBut the greatest percentage of urine samples showing traces of the least frequently found fentanyl analogs came from residents living in Penobscot County. Of those Penobscot County samples, 11.36 percent tested positive for at least one of seven rare analogs, such as acryl fentanyl.\nFor Dr. Noah Nesin, chief medical officer for Penobscot Community Health Care in Bangor, the data was startling. To have Penobscot County at the top of the list is distressing and a possible explanation as to why our overdose rates remain higher than the rest of the state, he said. PCHC does not send samples to Millennium Health.\nIn its other studies, Millennium Health can see methamphetamine use has been growing quickly in Maine  placing the state 10th nationally for its methamphetamine positivity rate among urine samples processed by Millennium Health. Maine has the fifth highest positivity rate in the nation for fentanyl, based on the laboratorys data. And for the number of samples showing a combination of methamphetamine and fentanyl, Maine ranks sixth, said Eric Dawson, the laboratorys vice president of clinical affairs.\nCombined with the recent evidence showing a high prevalence of rare fentanyl analogs in Penobscot County, it paints a very concerning picture of the state of Maine and that county specifically as it relates to those users, said Eric Dawson, vice president of clinical affairs at Millennium Health and a study author. As you start adding these things, you add to the risk of overdose.\nNeither Dawson nor Stanton know why the rare analogs appeared in Penobscot County in the eight months prior to the pandemic.\nNeither did Marcella Sorg, director of the Rural Drug and Alcohol Research Program within the University of Maine. But the results were not a surprise to her.\nI suppose thats unusual, but Maine has had fentanyl analogs present in the population since late 2012, she said.\nIn 2017, acryl fentanyl was involved in the drug death of one person in Maine, according to  Sorgs analysisof drug-related deaths that year. Butyryl fentanyl, another lesser-found analog, helped kill two people. Cyclopropyl fentanyl killed eight. And furanyl fentanyl, which the Millennium Health study didnt detect in its review, contributed to the deaths of 32 people in Maine that year. Maine has seen a variety of fentanyl analogs show up in the overdose data since.\nDifferent analogs seem to peak at different times. Its tough to get a real sense of why that may be, Stanton, with Millennium Health, said. But the authors hope that knowing more about the ever-changing makeup of the drugs in an area will help local providers and others have more informed conversations with people who are using drugs and enhance efforts to reduce overdoses, they said.\nSorg also questioned whether the studys sample size was large enough to protect against Penobscot County rising to the top of the list by chance. It is reasonable to assume that if the lesser-known analogs are in Penobscot County, they are also elsewhere in Maine, she said. Or, its possible Millennium Health tested Penobscot County samples at a particularly troublesome time.\nThey may have just happened to hit it when a bad batch showed up in the drug supply, she said.\nDr. Mark Publicker, an addiction specialist based in Portland who uses Millennium Health, agreed that the analogs may be common throughout the state. As for Penobscot Countys ranking, that may be a function of how many providers use Millennium, which may be greater than other areas in the state, he said.\nThe study does not reveal how many samples per county Millennium Health received. Because it is a private company, it doesnt disclose specific data about its customer base, Dawson said. But the company only analyzed counties where at least 10 samples tested positive for fentanyl, and 181 counties across 30 states met that bar. The lab detected the rarer group of fentanyl analogs in 56 counties across 16 states.\nOur data is limited to samples being sent to our lab from health care practitioners. It may not reflect the general population of users, but what we see for Maine is concerning, Dawson said.\nWhat is clear to Sorg from the study is that fentanyl an",

He said repeated electric signals can be sent to nerves to turn off their pain.\n\"In our studies, we can do that now; we can turn off pain now,\" Soin said.\nThrough his research, Soin also founded Motility Medical  https://motilitymedical.com/  in 2020. The biotech startup uses a device \"to interface with nerves and muscles to facilitate bowel activity without the use of oral pharmaceuticals,\" according to the website.\nSoin said this is particularly helpful in paralyzed patients who lose the ability to tell their brain to do an action.\n\"We can send signals to nerves to make muscles move and contract,\" Soin said. \"It stimulates the nerve. When you're paralyzed your brain can't fire the signal.\"\nSoin's work also includes developing new non-narcotic drugs for treating pain, such as for patients with diabetic nerve pain. He said another new drug he's developing will be used to treat complex regional pain syndrome.\n\"Dayton has been the first place to try some of these things,\" Soin said. \"In medical research we test with healthy volunteers. Interestingly, for patient volunteers we use Craigslist.\"\nErin Barker\n, director of operations and clinical services, research coordinator at Ohio Pain Clinic, has worked with Soin for over a decade. She actively recruits research candidates and assists on various clinical studies.\n\"Dr. Soin has extensive experience in the research arena,\" she said. \"He employs his expertise towards meaningful breakthroughs in the management of chronic pain through technology and collaboration. ... He has made it his lifes mission to derive methods of providing relief from debilitating conditions without the dependency of addicting medications.\"\nWhen reflecting over the last 18 months during the pandemic, Soin said he's proud of the entire healthcare system of workers.\n\"Health care workers were there; on the frontline before a vaccine,\" Soin said. \"I think that piece really needs to be recognized.\"\nSoin is a native of the Dayton area and attended Beavercreek High School. Soin completed his medical school training at University of Akron. He completed a residency at Rush University in Chicago, and his fellowship training at Cleveland Clinic.\nBy",

            "text": "In this June 6, 2017, file photo, a reporter holds up an example of the amount of fentanyl that can be deadly after a news conference about deaths from fentanyl exposure, at DEA Headquarters in Arlington, Va.\nCredit: Jacquelyn Martin / AP\nRare drugs designed to mimic the opioid fentanyl are showing up more often in urine samples from Penobscot County than any other county in the nation, according to a recent study. The findings are concerning to the authors, they said, since they come at a time when the fentanyl analogs are frequently being added to methamphetamine, creating a deadly combination.\nIn the study published in the Drug and Alcohol Dependence journal, the authors analyzed 300,000 urine drug tests from July 15, 2019, through March 12, 2020. Health professionals from all 50 states submitted urine samples to Millennium Health LLC, a commercial laboratory based in San Diego, to have them tested as part of patients routine care. The vast majority  295,647  had not been prescribed fentanyl for medical purposes.\nThe studys authors, who are all employees of Millennium Health, found that, of those patients testing positive for fentanyl without a fentanyl prescription, 40.55 percent had at least one fentanyl analog detected in their system, showing that copycat fentanyl is absolutely infiltrating the market for illicit substances, said Joseph Stanton, associate director of clinical affairs at Millennium Health and one of the studys authors.\nFentanyl analogs are usually produced in clandestine laboratories and, while they are chemically similar to fentanyl, they were specifically engineered to skirt U.S. law though the U.S. later banned them China is the principal source of fentanyl analogs, which has routed the drugs through the mail and Mexico, according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.\nSome drug dealers mix fentanyl analogs with other drugs, such as heroin, cocaine and methamphetamine. Mixing is cheaper for dealers because it takes only a small amount of a fentanyl analog to produce a high. However, its far riskier for users who dont always know what they are getting, evidenced by the fact that, in Maine, the average drug overdose death in 2019 involved three drugs Different analogs have different potencies, and they are not all well understood or well studied.\nOne well-known analog, however, is carfentanil, which, at 100 times the potency of fentanyl, was originally designed to sedate large animals such as elephants and moose. About 20 microgramsof carfentanil, which is less than a grain of salt, is enough to kill someone.\nOf the no-prescription, fentanyl-positive urine samples in the study, the counties that saw the highest positivity rates for more frequently found analogs such as carfentanil and acetyl fentanyl were in Kentucky and Ohio.\nBut the greatest percentage of urine samples showing traces of the least frequently found fentanyl analogs came from residents living in Penobscot County. Of those Penobscot County samples, 11.36 percent tested positive for at least one of seven rare analogs, such as acryl fentanyl.\nFor Dr. Noah Nesin, chief medical officer for Penobscot Community Health Care in Bangor, the data was startling. To have Penobscot County at the top of the list is distressing and a possible explanation as to why our overdose rates remain higher than the rest of the state, he said. PCHC does not send samples to Millennium Health.\nIn its other studies, Millennium Health can see methamphetamine use has been growing quickly in Maine  placing the state 10th nationally for its methamphetamine positivity rate among urine samples processed by Millennium Health. Maine has the fifth highest positivity rate in the nation for fentanyl, based on the laboratorys data. And for the number of samples showing a combination of methamphetamine and fentanyl, Maine ranks sixth, said Eric Dawson, the laboratorys vice president of clinical affairs.\nCombined with the recent evidence showing a high prevalence of rare fentanyl analogs in Penobscot County, it paints a very concerning picture of the state of Maine and that county specifically as it relates to those users, said Eric Dawson, vice president of clinical affairs at Millennium Health and a study author. As you start adding these things, you add to the risk of overdose.\nNeither Dawson nor Stanton know why the rare analogs appeared in Penobscot County in the eight months prior to the pandemic.\nNeither did Marcella Sorg, director of the Rural Drug and Alcohol Research Program within the University of Maine. But the results were not a surprise to her.\nI suppose thats unusual, but Maine has had fentanyl analogs present in the population since late 2012, she said.\nIn 2017, acryl fentanyl was involved in the drug death of one person in Maine, according to  Sorgs analysisof drug-related deaths that year. Butyryl fentanyl, another lesser-found analog, helped kill two people. Cyclopropyl fentanyl killed eight. And furanyl fentanyl, which the Millennium Health study didnt detect in its review, contributed to the deaths of 32 people in Maine that year. Maine has seen a variety of fentanyl analogs show up in the overdose data since.\nDifferent analogs seem to peak at different times. Its tough to get a real sense of why that may be, Stanton, with Millennium Health, said. But the authors hope that knowing more about the ever-changing makeup of the drugs in an area will help local providers and others have more informed conversations with people who are using drugs and enhance efforts to reduce overdoses, they said.\nSorg also questioned whether the studys sample size was large enough to protect against Penobscot County rising to the top of the list by chance. It is reasonable to assume that if the lesser-known analogs are in Penobscot County, they are also elsewhere in Maine, she said. Or, its possible Millennium Health tested Penobscot County samples at a particularly troublesome time.\nThey may have just happened to hit it when a bad batch showed up in the drug supply, she said.\nDr. Mark Publicker, an addiction specialist based in Portland who uses Millennium Health, agreed that the analogs may be common throughout the state. As for Penobscot Countys ranking, that may be a function of how many providers use Millennium, which may be greater than other areas in the state, he said.\nThe study does not reveal how many samples per county Millennium Health received. Because it is a private company, it doesnt disclose specific data about its customer base, Dawson said. But the company only analyzed counties where at least 10 samples tested positive for fentanyl, and 181 counties across 30 states met that bar. The lab detected the rarer group of fentanyl analogs in 56 counties across 16 states.\nOur data is limited to samples being sent to our lab from health care practitioners. It may not reflect the general population of users, but what we see for Maine is concerning, Dawson said.\nWhat is clear to Sorg from the study is that fentanyl an",

TODAY pic\nSINGAPORE, Dec 11  The Singapore-based biotechnology company Tychan hasstarted the third and final phase of its clinical trials on an antibody drug for patients with Covid-19 after it received the nod from the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) in October.\nThe trials, which began today, will involve 1,305 volunteers. The company is in the process of recruiting trial candidates.\nTrials for the drug, known as TY027, will be done at the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) and National University Hospital (NUH). Patients may also check if they are suitable for the trials at Changi General Hospital and Sengkang General Hospital. If so, they will be referred to SGH or NUH.\nOwing to the low incidence of the coronavirus in Singapore, the trials will also involve hospitals overseas, such as Israels Sheba Medical Centre.\nTY027 is being explored as a treatment forpatients with Covid-19 to slow the progression of the disease and speed up recovery. It could also provide temporary protection against infection from SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19.\nInfectious diseases expert Ooi Eng Eong, who co-founded Tychan, told reporters in a video conference today that the firm had chosen Israel as a partner because the country allows it to carry out studies in a similar fashion asSingapore.\nIsrael is also not overwhelmed by the pandemic and has the capacity to conduct the trials.\nIsrael has recorded more than 352,000 Covid-19 cases and 2,960deaths.\nProfessor Ooi, who is also deputy director of Duke-NUS Medical Schools emerging infectious diseases programme, was unable to reveal the other countries Tychan is in talks with because of a non-disclosure agreement.\nOn why Tychan has to tie up with other countries to conduct the trials, Prof Ooi said that Singapore has been successful in containing Covid-19 and, thus, there are not enough suitable candidates.\nCandidates for the trial must be Covid-19 patients within the first six days of illness.\nThe lack of suitable trial volunteers in Singapore is also why Tychan had delayed moving into the third phase of clinical trials, even though media reports previously quoted Prof Ooi saying they were slated to start in August.\nTY027 has been in development since February 25. It is a partnership between Tychan and a stable of government departments, including the Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Health and Economic Development Board.\nIn June, it entered the first phase of human trials, which involved 23 volunteers.\nProf Ooi said the Phase One trial went very well and the antibodies were so safe, with no serious adverse effects, that researchers increased the dosage from 20mg per kg to 30mg per kg.\nThe decision was made to give ourselves the best chance of eliciting a quick antiviral effect.\nHe added that researchers debated among themselves on whether to move to Phase Two trials  this phase would only further test whether the drug is safe. A decision was made to skip to Phase Three.\nPhase Two is not powered to address efficacy you cannot conclude that a drug works, only that it is safe and has a chance of working, he said. In this time of pandemic, and with all the uncertainty, we might as well go to the direct answer (in Phase Three).\nThe results of Phase Three trials will hinge on how quickly Tychan can recruit volunteers.\nVaccines alone not enough\nWhen asked how the antibody drug differs from a vaccine, Prof Ooi said that a vaccine alone would not get rid of Covid-19.\nFor example, he noted that the protection a vaccine offers against the disease is about 95 per cent. That means there is still a chance for vaccinated individuals to contract the virus.\nFurthermore, vaccination may not be suitable for patients undergoing cancer treatment or those with a history of allergies.\nMoreover, we do not know how long the protection from vaccines will last. At some point, as the vaccine immunity wanes, there is a chance that Covid-19 could reappear, he said.\nIt is thus important to have both forms of treatment.\nAn antibody drug will allow those unable to be vaccinated to be protected in some way, said Prof Ooi.\nHe does not foresee issues mass-producing TY027, as the technology for such production of antibody drugs is mature, compared with new vaccine production.\nTo really tackle this problem of a re-emergence of a Covid-19 epidemic... having treatment (with antibody drugs) for Covid-19 that really drives the virus load down, so that we do not get severe disease, is still important to prevent our healthcare system from being choked up with severe cases.
