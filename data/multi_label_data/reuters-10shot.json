It closed at 1.8160/70 marks.\n    Viermetz also said he did not see the U.S. Federal funds\nrate falling below six pct for fear of provoking an\nuncontrolled fall in the dollar.\n    But at the same time, worries about the international debt\ncrisis would mean there was little chance of a rise above 6-3/4\npct since this would increase loan costs to the third world.\n    The Middle East foreign exchange conference brings together\nmore than 200 traders and bank treasury chiefs from the Arab\nworld and Arab banks in European and U.S. Financial centres.\n    Formal discussions, which end today, have also centred on\nthe role of Arab banks in world financial markets, with bankers\nurging them to adapt to a new global trend towards\nsecuritisation of  business.\n    Hikmat Nashashibi, President of the Arab Bankers\nAssociation, said Arab banks have to shake off their old\nmentality of commercial banking and concentrate more on\ninvestment banking.\n REUTER\n",

There's no real\nreason for it to change policy,\" said Joseph Liro of S.G.\nWarburg and Co Inc.\n    Liro said the economy is showing moderate growth and does\nnot require immediate policy easing and the money aggregates\nmay well end March at the bottom of their target ranges.\n    All of the economists agreed that the Fed's major concern\nnow is recent weakness in the dollar which early this week was\nheavily supported by central banks. They said fear of hurting\nthe dollar will cause the Fed to be cautious in lowering\ninterest rates further.\n    Numbers released by the Fed today were all in line with\nexpectations and similar to the data for most of this year.\n    The Fed said that banks' net free reserves averaged 603 mln\ndlrs in the two-week statement period that ended on Wednesday\nversus 749 mln dlrs in the previous period.\n    In the single week to Wednesday, banks' borrowings at the\ndiscount window, less extended credits, averaged 302 mln dlrs\ncompared with 228 mln dlrs in the first week of the statement\nperiod. Meanwhile the Federal funds rate average edged up to\n6.14 pct from 6.08 pct.\n    The Fed's failure to add reserves in the market on Tuesday\nand Wednesday surprised some, but economists said the data\nreleased today suggest it had no real need to add reserves.\n    The Fed's absence may be explained by the lack of any\npressing need for it to supply reserves and by a desire to\nboost borrowings in the second week of the statement period to\nmeet its borrowings target, said Liro of Warburg.\n    Liro said the Fed probably is shooting for a two-week\nborrowings average of 300-325 mln dlrs. The borrowings actually\naveraged 265 mln dlrs in the latest statement period and that\nwas up from 191 mln dlrs in the prior period.\n    Brusca of Nikko agreed that the Fed probably is aiming for\ntwo-week average discount window borrowings of around 300 mln\ndlrs. He said that would correspond to a Federal funds rate of\naround 6.10 pct.\n    It is nearly impossible for the Fed to hit any borrowings\ntarget since the demand for excess reserves is erratic, said\nWells Fargo's Nathan. He said the Fed is focusing instead on\nthe funds rate and is trying to keep it roughly within a six to\n6-1/4 pct band.\n    Upward funds rate pressure and a big reserve-adding need\nare anticipated for the statement period that began today.\n More\n    Brusca believes the Fed will have to add 3.5 to four\nbillion dlrs a day in reserves in this statement period. Liro\nputs the add need at around 3.9 billion dlrs.\n    To partly address this requirement, many expect the Fed to\nadd permanent reserves with effect next Thursday by offering to\nbuy all maturities of Treasury bills on Wednesday. A similar\ncoupon \"pass\" may be required later.\n    There will be a greater demand for funds in this statement\nperiod because it includes the close of the quarter. Further\nupward pressure on the Federal funds rate may come from window\ndressing demand as the Japanese fiscal year ends on March 31.\n Reuter\n",

Privately, some bank\nofficials forecast the Bank will hold out at least for this\nweek, but at least one bank says a rise is possible tomorrow.\nIf a move comes before March 17, forecasts are for a half-point\ncut, with another half or full point about Budget day.\n REUTER\n",

The current quota agreement\nexpires next March and beef quota negotiations are set to get\nunderway this fall.\n    The Reagan administration has called for an end to the\nquotas by April, 1988, but Japanese officials have said they\nwould not liberalize imports regardless of the U.S. pressure.\n    Officials from the Meat Export Federation told Reuters that\nthey do not expect a complete lifting of the quota, but that\nthey hope for at least a gradual increase in the quota.\n    High beef prices in Japan caused by the protected market\nhas also kept beef consumption at modest levels, meat industry\nofficials said.\n    Japanese shoppers pay an average of 27.14 dlrs for a U.S.\ntenderloin steak in a restaurant and an average of 47.42 dlrs\nfor a Japanese-produced restaurant steak, the meat association\nsaid.

However, the sources noted\na late temporao is always more susceptible to pod rot, which\nflourishes if conditions turn cold and humid, and which is more\nlikely from late July on.\n    This year's crop is doubly susceptible because poor prices\nmean farmers were not encouraged to invest in fertilisers and\ninsecticides and are also unlikely to treat against pod rot.\n    A severe attack of pod rot can cause the loss of over\n500,000 bags in a very short period, one source said.\n    Because of the increased exposure to pod rot damage,\nestimates of the final outcome of the temporao are extremely\nvulnerable and production could easily drop to below the 2.0\nmln bag mark if the disease hits.\n    Although flowering was good following the start of the\nrains, pod setting was not up to expectations, possibly because\nthe drought had caused a drop in the insect population which\npollinates flowers, the sources said.\n    However, reports from farms indicate moisture levels are\nnow generally back to near normal levels and that current\nflowering and pod setting is good, which should result in\nmature fruit from August through September.\n    The sources said they expect no break in the harvesting of\nbeans between the end of the temporao and the beginning of the\nmain crop, which officially starts on October 1.\n    \"The cut-off date is completely artificial. If things go\nwell from now on we should see heavy harvesting without a break\nfrom August through November or even December,\" one said.\n    If predictions of a 2.0 to 2.5 mln bag temporao prove\naccurate this would be below the 2.7 mln bag average for the\npast 10 years. The last poor temporao was in 1984 when\nprolonged drought and later pod rot cut production to 1.79 mln\nbags, the lowest since 1974.\n    Good growing conditions the following year produced a\ntemporao of 3.12 mln bags, just below the 1983 3.17 mln bag\nrecord, while last year's output, which also suffered some\ndrought damage, was 2.77 mln bags.\n    Figures for the coming temporao might be distorted upwards\nby the inclusion of undeclared current main crop beans.\n    The sources said large quantities of beans are believed to\nhave been undeclared from this year's record total harvest and\nthey were unsure how much of this would be unregistered by the\nend of the official crop year on April 30.\n    Recent official arrivals figures have been swollen by the\ninclusion of beans which had been delivered previously to port\nwarehouses but not declared.\n    Because of the high turnover of beans this year,\nsignificant amounts have deteriorated because they were stored\ntoo long at the back of warehouses. Some of these are expected\nto be held for mixing in with early temporao arrivals.\n    With official arrivals figures for the 1986/87 temporao and\nmain crops totalling over 6.1 mln bags, and over seven weeks\nstill to go to the end of the year, the total outturn should be\nat least a record 6.5 mln bags if all production is declared,\nthe sources said.\n    This would compare with the previous record set last year\nof 6.03 mln.\n    However, there is no way of telling how many current crop\nbeans will be declared after the May 1 start of the temporao\nand thus the true size of the 1986/87 harvest may never be\nofficially registered.\n Reuter\n",

The five institutes had jointly forecast\nthree pct 1987 growth in October last year.\n    Taking a dissenting view, the DIW institute of West Berlin\nand Munich's Ifo institute predicted only one pct 1987 growth.\n    The joint report said that the estimates of economic\ndevelopment made by the DIW and Ifo were \"markedly less\nfavourable\" than those of the other three.\n    The DIW and Ifo forecast the economy would pick up after a\nslow start to the year. \"In the second half of 1987 there will,\nhowever, only be a weak upward movement,\" they said.\n    The two institutes said external economic factors which\nwere currently damaging exports and pushing up imports would\ndominate the economic environment throughout the year. They saw\nexports falling by a real 2-1/2 pct in 1987 and predicted no\nmarked improvement in the course of the year.\n    The other three institutes, however, wrote: \"The decline in\ndemand and production (seen) in the winter months does not\nindicate the beginning of a cyclical downswing.\"\n    They said the sharp rise of the mark had led to corporate\nuncertainty and companies had not carried out investment plans.\nBut they expected that many investments had not been cancelled\nbut only put off. \"It can be presumed that the braking actions\n(on the economy) will diminish markedly this year.\"\n    They added: \"The domestic prerequisites for a continuation\nof the economic uptrend are still favourable.\"\n    These three institutes said diminishing external burdens\ncombined with favourable domestic conditions meant an upturn in\ndemand and production could be expected by the spring.\n    However, this projection was clouded by risks including the\nfurther development of the mark against the dollar.\n    Contrary to the DIW and Ifo, the three institutes said that\nwhile exports would continue to be the weak point of the\neconomy in 1987, \"there is good reason to believe that exports\nwill soon bottom out and that a slight rise will emerge during\nthe course of the year.\" They predicted an overall 0.5 pct fall\nin exports in 1987, the same as in 1986.\n    The three more positive institutes saw private consumption\nrising by four pct in 1987, compared with 4.2 pct in 1986,\nwhile DIW and Ifo predicted a three pct increase.\n    They saw the climate for equipment investment improving but\npredicted only a rise of four pct in 1987 against 4.6 pct in\n1986. Ifo and DIW saw these investments rising by only two pct.\n    All the institutes predicted only a slight decline in\nunemployment. The Kiel, Hamburg and Essen institutes said the\njobless total would average 2.17 mln in 1987 compared with 2.23\nmln in 1986 and predicted a rise in the number of people in\nwork of about 200,000.\n    These three institutes said new jobs would be created\nmainly in the private services sector and also by the state in\nthe context of job creation measures. The construction industry\nwas likely to engage new workers for the first time since 1980\nbut they predicted either no rise in employment in the\nmanufactured goods industry or only a slight expansion.\n    The DIW and Ifo said rises in employment would occur only\nin the tertiary sector, while \"the number employed in the\nmanufacturing industry will decline.\"\n    The DIW and Ifo said unemployment would only decline to\n2.20 mln in 1987 from 2.23 mln in 1986.\n    They saw the current account surplus falling in 1987 to 58\nbillion marks from 78 billion in 1986. The other three saw a\ncurrent account surplus in 1987 of at least 60 billion marks\nand predicted that the trade surplus would fall to only around\n100 billion marks from 112 billion in 1986.\n    The institutes agreed that consumer prices would start to\nrise in 1987, after they declined in 1986, and all five\npredicted an average increase over the year of 0.5 pct.\n REUTER\n",

Taken together, the four\nAmerican-led warrant issues raised only about 50 mln Swiss\nfrancs.\n    But banks believe the vehicle meets a need of investors and\npredicted a lively future.\n    Andrew Barrett of Citicorp Investment Bank (Switzerland) AG\nsaid: \"The warrants give smaller investors a chance to have a\nlong-term investment in gold with limited risk.\"\n    Citicorp in Zurich launched the first of these warrants on\nFebruary 27, following it up with a second issue less than a\nweek later. The issuer in both cases was Citibank NA.\n    The idea found some quick copies. Goldman Sachs in Zurich\norganized and co-led an issue for the Swiss branch of Banque\nIndosuez on March 9 and last night Morgan Guaranty\n(Switzerland) AG did another for Morgan Guaranty Trust Co of\nNew York.\n    The four issues now offer investors striking prices for\ngold ranging from the Indosuez issue at 410 dlrs an ounce, the\nsame price as the underlying commodity, to a 430 dlr level on\nthe first one for Citibank.\n    The premiums range from 22 pct to 36 pct and maturities\nfrom 18 months to four years and three months, in all cases\nlonger than gold futures and options on U.S. Markets.\n    The bankers traced the inspiration for the market back to\nthe February report of U.S. Consumer prices for January, when a\njump of 0.7 pct raised again the threat of inflation.\n    \"Many people are worried about inflation again,\" said Mats\nJoensson of Goldman Sachs. \"Money supply in Germany and the\nUnited States has grown very strongly in the last year and\npeople want to take a ride on gold.\"\n    The gold market, having seen strong gains in 1986, has\nlanguished just above 400 dlrs an ounce over the past few\nweeks. But the banks saw in warrants the vehicle for a more\nhighly leveraged play where the downside risk was limited.\n    Barrett said it was natural that the market developed in\nSwitzerland. \"People here understand gold, and they understand\nwarrants,\" he said.\n    Citicorp (Switzerland) pioneered warrants with a series of\nequity-linked covered issues based on Japanese company shares\nover the past two years, and last autumn, Swiss banks launched\ncovered warrants in Swiss registered shares in a bid to give\nforeign investors a chance to play in a market otherwise closed\nto all but Swiss citizens, and to play it with higher leverage.\n    But after a quick flurry of issues, that market dried up\nwhen Swiss shares prices fell from their January peaks.\n    The issues are being marketed not on the basis of simple\npremiums, but on implicit volatility models devised to provide\nscientific comparisons between titles in the options market.\n    Martin Bachem of Morgan Guaranty said his bank's issue was\ncompetitive despite its relatively high premium. The issue, for\nfive ounces at 425 dlrs, was priced at 955 Swiss francs, making\na premium over the spot gold price of nearly 36 pct.\n    Using a Black Sholes options model, he said the issue's\nlong, 4.3-year maturity meant the warrants needed an implicit\nvolatility of gold of only 24.5 pct for the option to pay off,\nwhich he claimed was lower than the other issues.\n    But Barrett said the Black Sholes variant Citicorp used\npointed to a higher volatily for the Morgan issue and\nemphasized that the models were at best an inexact science.\n    And each bank, using its own model, put the implicit\nvolatility needed for its own issue at close to 25 pct.\n    Whatever the calculation, the issues have received a warm\nwelcome from investors.\n    Joensson of Goldman Sachs said there was a lot of demand,\neven among small investors, who were buying 15 or 20 warrants\napiece. \"The most sophisticated ones wouldn't buy these because\nthe premiums are too high,\" he said.\n REUTER\n",

But there is no\nway they can trade their way out of this situation,\" Aldo\nRoldan, Vice President for International Services at Chase\nEconometrics, said.\n    Roldan told Reuters that Brazil not only had to tackle the\nproblems of satisfying domestic demand and competing on glutted\nworld markets, but also had to work to make its position on\nforeign exchange markets more profitable.\n    \"Domestic costs have increased (due to inflation) and\nexporters have not had the same offsetting movement in exchange\nrates,\" Roldan said.\n    The Chase economist also said commodities markets were\ndepressed and generally did not appear very promising for a\ncountry like Brazil, where pure commodities account for some 50\npct of exports and in 1986 had a total value of around 23\nbillion dlrs.\n    But he added: \"They are always pretty aggressive and they\nhave good foreign marketing channels.\"\n    Analysts said a key factor in Brazilian trade will be\ncoffee, and even without background pressure from foreign\ncreditors the world's largest producer was expected to hit the\nmarket this year with a vengeance.\n    Negotiations between International Coffee Organization\n(ICO) members to re-establish producer export quotas broke up\nearlier this week with major producers and consumers accusing\neach other of intransigence.\n    \"Brazil would not tolerate a change in ICO regulations,\nwhich others wanted changed,\" one senior coffee dealer said.\n    The dealer, who declined to be named, said Brazil wanted to\npreserve its market share. At the end of the talks, he said\nBrazil hinted it could sell more than anyone else and others\nwould suffer.\n    Brazil will be an aggressive seller under any scenario but\nas yet there is no sign of unusually heavy Brazilian sales, the\ndealer said.\n    \"If they do come into the market at this level it will go\nlower and you could breach a dollar, ninety or eighty cents,\"\nhe said.\n    New York coffee futures for May delivery settled 2.29 cents\nlower Thursday at 104.68 cents a lb, while more distant\ndeliveries fell the six-cent maximum trading limit.\n    President of the Brazilian Coffee Institute, Jorio Dauster\ntold a press conference in Rio de Janeiro today that Brazil has\nno set target for its coffee exports following the breakdown of\nthe ICO talks on export quotas.\n    Many economists and analysts believe soybeans could be the\nfocus of possible stepped-up Brazilian marketing efforts. \"They\nwill be more aggressive this year than they have ever been,\"\naccording to Richard Loewy, analyst for Prudential-Bache\nSecurities Inc.\n    Loewy believes the foreign debt problem, a good crop, plus\ndifficulties with storage would help motivate selling of the\nBrazil soybean crop. \"Brazilian farmers also need cash flow and\nthey can't afford to store the crops,\" he said.\n    The Chicago soybean complex has been nervous for some time\nabout large South American crops developing under near ideal\nconditions towards record yields.\n    \"We are going to see a very rapid decline, earlier than\nusual, this year in our (U.S.) exports,\" Loewy said.\n    Tommy Eshleman, economist for the American Soybean\nAssociation (ASA), said this year's Brazilian soybean harvest\ncould total 18 mln tonnes, versus 13.7 mln last year.\n    Marketings will be very aggressive this summer when prices\nare usually high relative to the rest of the year due to the\nvulnerability of the U.S. crop to bad growing weather.\n    Another incentive to sell might be trade anticipation of a\nreduction in the U.S. government soybean loan rate, offered to\nfarmers who give crops as collateral, Eshleman said.\n    He said there has been some uncertainty this year about the\nsoybean loan rate, which acts as an effective floor for prices\nby keeping supplies away from the free market. Farmers can\nforfeit their beans to the government rather than repay the\nloan.\n    \"We're getting into a period when they (Brazil) are\nstarting to harvest and starting to export,\" Eshleman said. But\nhe added it will be a while before U.S. exports fall to below\n10 mln bushels a week from around 20 mln bushels currently.\n    Jose Melicias from the research department of Drexel\nBurnham Lambert said Brazil would be trying to export as much\nas it can this year because of its economic situation.\n    He said the debt situation was a major consideration. \"The\nBrazilian government also does not have enough money to pay for\nstorage,\" he added.\n    Asked if a return to an inflationary environment in Brazil\nwould make farmers inclined to hold onto crops, Melicias said\nit would not make a big difference.\n    On other commodity markets, Brazil's selling impact may be\nmuted no matter its need to generate capital.\n    Brazil is faced with a poor 1986/87 sugar harvest, which\ncould limit exports to the world market, analysts said. The\ncountry may have oversold and be unable to honor export\ncommitments, and this plus higher domestic demand caused by\nconsumer price subsidies on ethanol and refined sugar, will\ngive it little room to stretch exports, they said.\n    Brazil's other major crop, cocoa, is in its third year of\nsurplus. \"Cocoa consumption is basically flat and last year it\nfell, so I don't think they can start throwing out cocoa and\nfind many more markets for it,\" one analyst said.\n    \"If they come out as aggressive sellers, the market would\ncollapse and they can't afford to do that,\" she added.\n Reuter\n",

Chris Dunn, economist at Royal Bank of\nCanada, said the remarks may signal a decisive move to insulate\nsterling from the fortunes of the dollar.\n    Although about two-thirds of Britain's trade is conducted\nwith European countries, sterling has traditionally shadowed\nthe dollar rather than the mark, analysts noted.\n    \"Britain must decide whether it wants to follow the U.S. Or\nthrow in its lot with Europe,\" Dunn said.\n    \"It suggests that while the U.K. Is not actually applying to\njoin the European Monetary System, it is seeking protection by\nshadowing it ... The Bundesbank has made it clear that it wants\nthe U.K. To clarify its position relative to the mark,\" he said.\n    Analysts said sterling's dip on currency markets following\nLawson's remarks made an early half-point cut in U.K. Base\nrates from current 10 pct levels unlikely in the short term.\n    \"Over the next three weeks, a cut is out, unless we get some\nextremely good economic indicators,\" Capel's Skeoch said.\n    Base rates have been cut twice by one-half point in March,\nthe last after the March 17 budget presentation, and analysts\nhad been expecting another half point cut shortly afterwards.\n REUTER\n",

Japan's rice PSE was 68.8 pct compared to the EC\n13.6 and the U.S. 5.4 pct, the OECD calculations show.\n    In coarse grains, Japan's subsidies reached 107.1 pct\ncompared with 27.9 pct for the EC and 13.1 pct for the U.S.\nJapan's beef subsidy was 54.9 pct versus 52.7 pct for the EC\nand 9.5 pct for the U.S., OECD concluded.\n    For sugar, Japan's PSE was 48.4 pct versus 27.9 pct in the\nEC and 13.1 pct for the U.S., the study shows.\n    The OECD calculated farm subsidies for other industrial\ncountries such as Canada, Australia and New Zealand but in most\ncases the results were much lower than for the U.S., EC and\nJapan, the sources said.\n    Subsidies in Argentina and Brazil, two major developing\ncountry producers of commodities, were not included in the OECD\nwork.\n    Officials said they hope to persuade reluctant countries to\nrelease the study soon, perhaps coinciding with the OECD\nministerial meeting in Paris during May.\n    Some officials hope the OECD results will be used as a \nbasis for negotiations during the Uruguay round of global trade\ntalks now underway in Geneva.\n    British Agriculture Minister Michael Jopling during a visit\nto Washington this week endorsed the OECD work as a starting\npoint for the Uruguay round negotiations on agriculture.\n    He said the PSE calculations provide a tool to negotiate\ndown domestic farm support levels, which are a major cause of\nthe present crisis in world agriculture.\n    However, the OECD study results are controversial because\nthey highlight the levels of assistance to farmers, officials\nfamiliar with the study said.\n    The U.S. Agriculture Department's Economic Research Service\nrecently published a study of farm subsidies in an attempt to\nverify the OECD results and update them to 1982-84.\n    In some cases the results were substantially different than\nthe OECD's, in part because farm policies in both the U.S. and\nelsewhere had changed markedly by 1982-84 from the OECD base\nperiod of 1979-81, U.S. officials said.\n    For example, the USDA study found the United States\nsubsidies to corn producers were higher in 1982-84, at 25 to 49\npct, than in the EC, at zero to nine pct.\n    French Maize Producers Association president Marcel Cazale,\nciting the result of the USDA calculation for corn, told\nreporters last week that the United States subsidizes its\nfarmers more than the EC.\n    However, the sources said EC corn subsidies are probably\nhigher than the U.S. now because of increases since 1984.\n    Officials of several countries have been asked to\ncontribute data to OECD so that the study can be updated to\n1985 subsidy levels, a much more relevant measure of the\ncurrent world farm situation.\n    The updated calculations, which may take several months to\ncomplete, are expected to show substantial increases in U.S.\nsubsidy levels for sugar because the U.S. imposed restrictive\nimport quotas in 1982 as aid to the domestic industry.\n    U.S. subsidy levels also are increased by the 1985 farm\nbill, which sharply boosted government deficiency payments to\ngrain farmers and applied a marketing loan for rice, officials\nadded.\n Reuter\n",

Johsen\nTakahashi, chief economist at Mitsubishi Research Institute,\nsaid the 14.4 pct increase in public sector spending in Oct/Dec\nresulted from an issue of gold coins.\n    \"This is just a one-shot spending and we can't expect that\nhigh level of public-sector consumption in the following\nquarter,\" Takahashi said. Agency officials said public spending\nwould have risen 1.1 pct in Oct/Dec without the issue, which\nmarked 60 years of Emperor Hirohito's reign.\n    Takahashi said the economy might contract in the current\nquarter given the lack of additional significant government\nspending and sluggish consumer spending.\n    Saito said the most effective government action would be\nincome tax cuts and the postponement beyond next January of a\nproposed controversial sales tax.\n REUTER\n",

Today's relatively stable oil\nprices of about 18 dlrs a barrel are not enough to spur a\nreturn to the heady days of 1981 when the U.S. drilling rig\ncount soared to a record high of more than 4,500 and oilfield\nroustabouts commanded premium wages.\n    The latest weekly Hughes Tool Co &lt;HT> rig count, a\nbarometer of the oil industry's health, showed 761 U.S. rigs\nactive in what is traditionally the slowest time of the year.\n    In 1986, the Hughes rig count began the year at 1,915 but\ndived to a post-World War II low of 663 in July as world oil\nprices experienced the sharpest decline in recent times.\n    Ike Kerridge, a Hughes economist, said \"In 1986, the United\nStates replaced only about 40 pct of the gas it used and that\nreplacement rate won't be any better this year.\"\n    He added, \"We don't have the options we do with oil.\nImports of gas from Canada are limited by pipeline capacity and\nimporting liquefied natural gas on ships will not be feasible\nin the next 10 years because of the cost.\"\n    Only about 6 trillion cubic feet of additional gas reserves\nwere discovered last year while U.S. consumption approached 16\ntrillion cubic feet, according to industry estimates.\n    George Gaspar, an oil analyst with Robert W. Baird and Co\nagreed that the need for gas supplies would set the stage for a\nnew cycle of gradual increases in U.S. drilling.\n    \"We anticipate that natural gas pipelines will need to\ndedicate to their systems new gas reserves for 1989 and 1990\nsupplies. That means new drilling programs must begin no later\nthan mid-1988,\" Gaspar said.\n    Gasper said he sees a new drilling cycle emerging that\ncould last until 1992 and that he expects the average rig count\nto peak near 2,000 in December of 1989.\n    Much of the search for new gas reserves is likely to be\nconducted in the offshore waters of the Gulf of Mexico, where\nfederal leases on unexplored areas will revert back to the\ngovernment unless drilling begins in the next two or three\nyears. Some of the industry's biggest companies, such as Exxon\nCorp &lt;XON>, Mobil Corp MOB, and Union Texas Petroleum have\nalready indicated plans to increase spending for drilling later\nthis year in the Gulf of Mexico, Crandall said.\n    For example, Conoco Inc, a Dupont &lt;DD> subsidiary, will\nspend 400 mln dlrs to build the Gulf of Mexico's deepest\nproduction platform, which will produce 50 mln cubic feet of\ngas per day.\n    But T. Boone Pickens, who has acquired huge Texas and\nKansas gas reserves for his Mesa Limited Partnership &lt;MLP> in\nrecent months, is not convinced that the drilling industry is\non the verge of a recovery.\n    Pickens predicts the U.S. rig count will soon drop below\n600 and will not increase significantly until oil prices do.\n    \"The rigs won't go back to work until the price of oil gets\nabove 30 dlrs a barrel,\" said Pickens, 58, adding he did not\nexpect to see the rig count top 2,000 again in his lifetime.\n    Tenneco Inc &lt;TGT>, one of the largest U.S. gas producers,\nis skeptical that a need for additional gas drilling exists.\n    Tenneco vice president Joe Foster said he did not expect\nsignificant increases in drilling for gas until the early 1990s\nwhen the U.S. gas reserves life will have declined to about\nseven years' supply. Current spot market prices of about 1.50\ndlrs per thousand cubic feet will need to rise to about three\ndlrs to spur reserve replacement, he said.\n Reuter\n",

Mining\nis monopolised by ZCCM and accounts for about 90 pct of the\ncountry's foreign exchange earnings.\n    Production has also been seriously affected in recent years\nby equipment breakdowns, deteriorating ore and shortages of\nspare parts, fuel and lubricants. The 463,354 tonnes output\nlast year compared with a peak 1975 output of 700,000 tonnes.\n    A five-year production and investment plan launched in 1984\nby ZCCM is being funded by the European Community, the African\nDevelopment Bank and the World Bank.\n    The plan foresees the shutdown of some seven mining and\nmetallurgical units on the grounds they are unprofitable.\n    ZCCM, the second largest employer after the government, has\nsaid it intends to lay off 20,000 of its 60,000 workforce as\npart of the plan.\n    More than 250 mln dlrs have so far been channelled into the\nindustry in a bid to improve efficiency and profitability under\nthe five-year restructuring plan.\n    Company officials said although reserves were being\ndepleted, Zambia could continue to produce copper beyond the\nend of the century, though at lower levels of production.\n    Industry sources said ZCCM's projected pre-tax profit for\nthe financial year ended March 31 would be around 500 mln\nkwacha. But with the current mineral export tax level being\nlevied, a net loss is likely to be registered.\n    ZCCM recorded a net loss of 718 mln kwacha in 1986 compared\nwith a net profit of 19 mln kwacha the year before.\n    Under the foreign exchange auction system introduced in\n1985, ZCCM's profits from its foreign exchange earnings rose as\nthe value of the kwacha fell to 21 to the dollar from just over\ntwo to the dollar.\n    But on May 1, President Kenneth Kaunda abolished the\nauctioning system, inspired by the International Monetary Fund,\nand announced Zambia would pursue a go-it-alone economic\nstrategy based on national resources.\n    ZCCM officials are still cautious over what effects the\nbreak with the IMF will have on the industry's plans.\n    \"We are still consulting to see how the new measures will\naffect us but it is too early to say just how we shall fare\nunder the new situation,\" Peter Hansen, director of operations\nand third in the ZCCM hierarchy, told Reuters.\n    Some analysts believe the new officially-fixed exchange\nrate of eight kwacha to the dollar will hit ZCCM's export\nprofits.\n    \"Most specialists I have talked to tell me the break-even\npoint for ZCCM is a rate of 10 kwacha per dollar,\" Frederick\nChiluba, leader of the Zambian Congress of Trade Unions said.\n    High production costs continue to bedevil the Zambian\nindustry.\n    Zambia mines copper at a relatively expensive rate of 69\ncents per pound, compared with 55 cents in the United States\nand under 40 cents in Chile.\n    The industry also faces transport problems due to Zambia\nbeing landlocked. The government confirmed this year it had\nstopped sBending copper south through South Africa.\n    Over 80 pct of shipments, some 35,000 tonnes a month, are\nsent by rail to the Tanzanian port of Dar-es-Salaam, while\n5,000 tonnes go via Zimbabwe to the Mozambique port of Beira.\nTransport has often been hit by shortages of wagons, spares and\nfuel.\n Reuter\n",

The buffer stock\nmanager is expected to begin buying cocoa within the next three\nweeks, after organizing communications with cocoa producing\ncountries and assessing the market, since prices are below the\n\"must-buy\" level of 1,600 Special Drawing Rights per tonne\nspecified in the agreement, the sources said.\n    The buffer stock theoretically has funds to buy a maximum\n100,000 tonnes within a five week period, but its approach will\nbe more cautious, buffer stock manager Juergen Plambeck said.\n    The buffer stock has around 250 mln dlrs in funds and a\nbuying limit of 250,000 tonnes of cocoa, 100,000 tonnes of\nwhich are already in the buffer stock.\n    ICCO council chairman and Ivorian Agriculture Minister\nDenis Bra Kanon said the new rules have a good chance of\nstabilizing prices. Ivory Coast is the world's largest cocoa\nproducer.\n    \"We have established rules which will permit us to withdraw\nimmediately the surplus of cocoa on the world market,\" Bra Kanon\ntold reporters after the council adjourned. Bra Kanon reckoned\nthe world cocoa surplus could be less than half the 94,000\ntonnes estimated by the ICCO statistics committee.\n    However, some producer and consumer members emerged from\nthe final ICCO council meeting with reservations about the\npact.\n    Ghana, whose high-quality cocoa is the world's most\nexpensive and provides 60 pct of the country's export earnings,\nmade a formal protest to the council about the price\ndifferentials assigned to its cocoa, saying they were too high\nfor Ghanaian cocoa to be bought for the buffer stock.\n    According to consumer spokesman Peter Baron of West\nGermany, \"Consumers weren't perfectly happy with the buffer\nstock rules. We reached a very sensitive compromise...There\nwere no real winners or losers.\"\n    Some European Community delegates were not satisfied that\nimportant points were fully discussed during the talks, and as\na result, doubted the rules can deal with world surpluses as\neffectively as they could have, delegates said.\n    Under the new rules, the buffer stock manager would seek\noffers of different origin cocoas, using price differentials to\nreflect different qualities. Non-ICCO member cocoa can comprise\nup to 15 pct of the total buffer stock.\n    London cocoa prices traded today around 1,300 stg per\ntonne, down from around 1,450 stg in January 1987 and 1,750 stg\nin January 1986.\n    A cocoa withholding scheme can take a further 120,000\ntonnes of cocoa off the market if a special council session\ndecides market conditions warrant it, according to the\nagreement.\n    The withholding scheme can only be used if prices fall\nbelow the 1,600 SDR lower intervention price for more than five\ndays and if 80 pct of the maximum buffer stock capacity has\nbeen filled, or if the buffer stock runs low on funds, it says.\n    The ICCO will discuss withholding scheme rules at an\nexecutive committee meeting on June 9/12, ICCO officials said.\n REUTER\n",

Dealers here will also want to\nsee how acceptable foreign metal will be on the new market and\nwhat sort of demand develops for forward deliveries.\n    There is also a view among European traders that, while the\nproposed Kuala Lumpur tin futures market would provide another\nuseful reference point, a market inaugurated by the Malaysian\ngovernment -- in the past viewed as a major player at times by\nthe trade -- would make participants uncomfortable.\n    Some traders expressed a preference for a resumption of\ntrading on the London Metal Exchange, but they added that while\nthere has been some behind the scenes discussion on the subject\na definite move is unlikely until outstanding High Court\nlitigation actions have been resolved.\n    Spot tin prices on the European free market are currently\naround 4,200 stg per tonne for high grade metal in warehouse\nRotterdam. Over the past 18 months the price moved to a ten\nyear low of 3,400 stg in March 1986 and rebounded to as high as\n4,680 stg in December 1986.\n    This compares with 8,140 stg last paid when LME trading\nceased in October 1985 and a record high tin price of 10,350\nstg traded for Cash Standard Grade metal in June of that year.\n    LME warehouse stocks are now near a two-year low at 28,065\ntonnes, having fallen steadily from a record high of 72,485\ntonnes reached in February 1986.\n    Traders said the free market turned bullish during late\nlast year based on producer forecasts of a supply/demand\ndeficit of some 28,000/29,000 tonnes. Analysts were predicting\nprices of up to 5,000 stg per tonne during 1987.\n    However, the trend was reversed following a strong upswing\nin sterling versus the dollar and values fell back briefly to\n4,100 stg last month after approaching 4,700 stg in December.\n    The decline accelerated as producers who had sold very\nlittle metal at the higher levels became competitive sellers.\n    There was also a lack of significant demand from major\nsteel mills who made large purchases prior to the new year.\n    Traders say the 15 ITC creditor banks' original tin\nholdings of nearly 45,000 tonnes have now been almost halved,\nand the bulk of material still available is being held by\nMalaysian and Japanese firms which are reluctant to depress the\nmarket with unwanted metal.\n    Some 80,000 tonnes were held by banks and brokers after the\nInternational Tin Council's, ITC, buffer stock manager halted\nsupport operations on the LME on behalf of the 22 members\nnations of the International Tin Agreement.\n    The overhang of metal was reduced further by broker\nShearson Lehman Brothers, which earlier this year reported\nhaving sold its ITC-related holdings and halved its overall tin\nposition.\n    Analysts see no immediate sign of a rally in European tin\nprices and movements are still expected to be largely related\nto currency fluctuations, unless significant consumer demand\nemerges for the third quarter.\n    The Association of Tin Producing Countries, ATPC, has made\nefforts since the collapse of the ITA to achieve higher world\nprices by attempting to bring all major producers under an\nexport control umbrella, but to date Brazil and China, two\nmajor producers, remain unaffected by the ATPC argument and\napparently are continuing to offer material at discounts to\nconsumers in main European trading centres, dealers said.\n Reuter\n",

India has signed a trade protocol to\nbuy up to 15,000 tonnes of asbestos fibre from Zimbabwe in\nexchange for Indian goods, including jute bags and cars.\n    But despite India's new drive, countertrade has some\ninherent problems, they added.\n    \"It is not always easy to meet the basic requirement that\nthe trade should always be balanced,\" one trade source said. \"The\nother problem is it is often difficult to supply or buy\ncommodities which the other party wants.\"\n    Another added, \"Barter is also restrictive.

The non-member cocoa issue has\nbeen among the most contentious in the rules negotiations.\n    The 15 pct figure, up five percentage points from earlier\nproposals, represents a concession to consumers, delegates\nsaid. They have demanded a larger allowance for non-member\ncocoa in the buffer stock than producers have wanted.\n    Another problem area, delegates said, was the question of\nprice differentials for different origins of cocoa bought into\nthe buffer stock, by which the buffer stock manager could\nfairly compare relative prices of different cocoas offered to\nhim.\n    The compromise narrowed the range of differentials between\nthe origins from what previous proposals had detailed -- a move\nsome delegates described as \"just fiddling.\"\n    But the adjustments may prove significant enough to appease\nsome countries that were not satisfied with the original\nproposed differentials assigned to them, delegates said.\n    The compromise also stated buffer stock purchases on any\nday would be limited to 40 pct each in nearby, intermediate or\nforward positions, delegates said.\n    If the compromise is accepted by the council, most\nconsumers and producers want buffer stock rules to take effect\nnext week, or as soon as practically possible.\n    The full council is scheduled to meet around 1500 GMT to\ndiscuss the compromise, and could agree on it then if all\nparties are satisfied, they said.

Fekete said the rates would come into\neffect tomorrow.\n    He said one reason for the devaluation was that Hungary had\na higher rate of inflation over the past two years than its\nmain partners (around eight pct in 1985 and between five and\n5.5 pct in 1986).\n    This was partly an after-effect of action Hungary took to\nprevent inflation from soaring during the oil price shocks of\nthe 1970s, he added.\n    Hungary devalued by a similar amount last September and by\nbetween three and four pct early last year.\n    But the country's hard currency trade balance nevertheless\nfell into a deficit of 539.4 mln dlrs from a surplus of 295.3\nmln in 1986 and 1.2 billion in 1985.\n    Fekete said Hungary was hoping for a hard currency trade\nsurplus of between 200 and 300 mln dlrs this year, but that a\nmore likely outcome would be closer to equilibrium on total\nhard currency trade of around 10 billion dlrs.\n    One Western commercial attache here said: \"Devaluation of\nitself will not change anything. It will only be useful if they\nalso make efforts to restructure industry and improve the\nquality of their export goods.\"\n    Fekete said he hoped to raise credits on good terms this\nyear to invest in restructuring industry.\n    It would be his role to persuade international banks to\ncooperate in this process. He noted Hungary had been given an\nAA rating enabling it to raise money on the Japanese Samurai\nbond market.\n    Hungary's net hard currency debt soared to 7.79 billion\ndlrs last year from 5.01 billion in 1985, partly because of a\ncurrent account deficit of 1.42 billion dlrs and partly because\nthe fall in the dollar increased the dollar value of debt\ndenominated in marks or yen.\n    He said he feared net debt would also rise slightly this\nyear, but he was in favour of borrowing for the purpose of\nmodernisation.\n    \"I am for credits to invest for that purpose,\" he said. \"I am\nagainst credits for consumption.\" He forecast gross domestic\nproduct growth of two pct this year, from one pct in 1986.\n   Fekete said Hungary would continue to restructure its debt\nprofile by prepaying high interest shorter and medium term\nloans with cheaper long term money for which it was looking\nmore and more to the fixed interest rate bond market, where he\nconsidered rates to be low.\n    Hard currency foreign exchange reserves would stay at\naround 3.5 billion dlrs, he said. On the budget deficit, which\ntripled to a provisional 47 billion forints last year after\nquadrupling in 1985, Fekete said the finance ministry was\nworking out measures to reduce an approved target deficit for\nthis year of 43.8 billion forints to between 30 and 35 billion\nforints.\n REUTER\n",

Inflation was zero last year.\n    Gross investment in industry was expected to grow by five\npct this year, a slowdown compared with 11.5 pct growth last\nyear, the CPB said.\n    Exchange rate and oil price fluctuations will continue to\ncondition the Dutch economy in the future as it has in recent\nyears, the CPB said, noting a continued depressing impact of\nthese factors on Dutch competitiveness.\n    In addition, it noted a slight rise in taxation and social\nsecurity costs to employers.\n    The CPB, forecasting a rise in the budget deficit to 7.2\npct of Net National Income in 1987 from 6.3 pct last year,\nurged the government to cut expenditure further to bring down\nthe deficit and reduce tax and social security payments in\nfuture.\n    Dutch government revenue is being depressed further by\nfalling income from natural gas sales in 1987, the CPB said.\n    It said unemployment was expected to fall to 675,000 this\nyear from 710,000 last year.\n    While the two pct GDP growth forecast set by the CPB is\nwithin its latest forecast, issued last month, of 1.5 to two\npct growth, the figure is well above recent market estimates.\n    Dutch merchant bank Pierson, Heldring en Pierson said in\nits February economic outlook that GDP growth at constant\nprices was expected to be 1.1 pct this year and market analysts\nhad expected the CPB's final forecast to be below its own\nlatest estimate.\n    \"It is too early to comment because I haven't seen the whole\ndocument yet, but it would seem we are more pessimistic in some\nof our estimates,\" a Pierson economist said.\n    The CPB forecast 2.5 pct export growth in volume terms in\n1987, after four pct growth last year. Excluding energy\nexports, the 1987 figure would be two pct, it said.\n    Imports were set to rise by 4.5 pct this year compared with\nfour pct in 1986 in volume terms, the CPB said.\n    The balance of payments would see a sharp decline in the\nsurplus, to six billion guilders in 1987 compared with 12.1\nbillion last year, the CPB forecast.\n REUTER\n",

The new INRA is to\nreplace the current one which expires in October.\n    Delegates at the renegotiation conference, held under the\nauspices of the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development\n(UNCTAD), reached agreement over the central elements of a new\naccord last weekend.\n    Xuto said the new INRA retains the reference price -- of\n201.66 Malaysian/Singapore cents per kilo -- and indicative\nprices set in the present pact.\n    Price levels will continue to be expressed in the joint\nMalaysian/Singapore currency, he added.\n    The new agreement also maintains the basic structure of\nprice ranges -- the \"may sell\" and \"may buy\" points at plus and\nminus 15 pct of the reference price, as well as the \"must sell\"\nand \"must buy\" zones at plus and minus 20 pct of it.\n    Xuto said the new pact maintains the same objectives that\nwere set in the present accord. \"The most important of these are\nto stabilise prices and to achieve a balanced growth between\ndemand and supply,\" he said. The buffer stock remains the sole\ninstrument of market intervention for price stabilisation and\nits maximum capacity is unchanged at 550,000 tonnes, Xuto\nadded.\n    At this month's session, which was the fourth attempt in\ntwo years to negotiate a new INRA, the main issue to be\nresolved concerned the mechanism for adjusting the reference\nprice.\n    It was agreed to conduct reviews of the reference price\nevery 15 months -- instead of the current 18-month intervals.\n    The extent of the adjustment was also modified.\n    Under the present agreement if the daily market indicator\nprice has been above the upper intervention (\"may sell\") price\n(currently 231 Malaysian/Singapore cents) or below the lower\nintervention price (\"may buy\") price (171 cents at present) for\nsix months, the reference price is then revised by five pct or\nwhatever amount the International Natural Rubber Council\ndecides.\n    Under the new pact, the adjustment under these\ncircumstances will be five pct unless the Council decides on a\nhigher adjustment.\n    Similarly, when buffer stock purchases or sales amount to\n300,000 tonnes, there would be an automatic adjustment of three\npct under the new accord unless the Council decides on a higher\npercentage.\n    Throughout the talks, which began on March 9, producers had\nstrongly opposed a consumer proposal to lower the reference\nprice and the \"lower indicative price\" (or floor price) of 150\ncents in the present pact if the buffer stock, currently\n360,000 tonnes, reached 450,000 tonnes.\n    The proposal, initiated by the U.S., was withdrawn last\nFriday, setting the stage for compromise at the weekend.\n    Since then negotiators have worked on the finer details of\nthe new pact.\n    On the question of conditions for entry into force of the\nnew INRA, Xuto said it was tentatively agreed that governments\naccounting for 75 pct of world exports and 75 pct of world\nimports approved or ratified the new agreement before it became\noperational.\n    The present agreement had a figure of 80 pct.\n Reuter\n",

It may be a shame,\nbut we are locked into this,\" said Dan Glickman, (D-Kans.),\nchairman of the subcommittee on wheat, soybeans and feed\ngrains. \"We need to look at ways to cut costs and not hurt the\nfarmer. A 0/92 plan, if properly done, could do both.\"\n    Glickman announced this week plans to introduce a 0/92 bill\nfor 1987 and 1988 wheat and feedgrains. An aide to Glickman\nsaid that it will probably be introduced next week.\n    Glickman said a 0/92 program, which allows a farmer to\nforego planting and still receive 92 pct of his deficiency\npayment, would not be a major revision of the 1985 farm bill --\nonly an extension of the 50/92 option already provided under\nthe current bill.\n    It is premature to make any major changes in the farm bill,\nhe said, but if agriculture has to make further cuts to meet\nbudget goals, a voluntary 0/92 plan would be better than\nsharply cutting target prices, as USDA has proposed.\n    A 0/92 plan, however, would not be decoupling, but simply a\ndifferent type of acreage diversion program, Glickman said.\n    Decoupling -- delinking planting decisions from government\npayments -- is too much of a policy change to approve at this\npoint, he said.\n    \"I don't think there is any interest in pursuing a\ndecoupling bill this year. Period. Unequivocal,\" Glickman said\nat the hearing.\n    Sen. Rudy Boschwitz (R-Minn.), cosponsor of the\nBoren/Boschwitz decoupling plan, said he supports a short term\n0/92 program as a move to a more permament decoupling plan.\n    Boschwitz plans to introduce a 0/92 plan in the senate. His\nplan would guarantee a certain deficiency payment to\nparticipating farmers, require that idled acreage be put to\nconservation use only, prohibit haying and grazing on extra\nidled acreage, limit participation to a certain number of acres\nin a county and provide tenant protection provisions.\n    \"I know we cannot obtain complete decoupling in 1987, but\nwe can at least move in that direction,\" Boschwitz said.\n    Robbin Johnson, vice president of Cargill, Inc., testified\nin favor of decoupling. Decoupling would end the current bias\nin U.S. farm policy towards overproduction and reduce farmers'\ndependency on the government, he said.\n    A 0/92 plan does not go far enough in decoupling, Johnson\nsaid, and would still encourage farmers to plant.\n    Officials from the National Corn Growers Association and\nthe National Cattlemen's Association said their groups oppose\nany 0/92 or decoupling plan due to concerns about reopening the\nfarm bill and creating more confusion among farmers.\n    But when asked if his association were forced to choose\nbetween a ten pct cut in target prices or a 0/92 program, Larry\nJohnson of the Corn Growers said they would agree to 0/92\nrather than take sharp cuts in target levels.\n Reuter\n",

But January's\nsales were revised down to a 7.4 pct drop, from a previously\nreported 5.8 pct decline.\n    \"The trend is toward continued spending but certainly at a\nmuch more sluggish pace,\" said Don Maude of Midland Montagu\nCapital Markets Inc.\n    Maude averaged out the wide swings in the retail sales data\nover past four months to show that the pace of consumer\nspending is slowing.\n    Combining the latest data with a 0.6 pct drop in November\nand a 4.6 pct gain in December, the average retail sales gain\nover the four months was 0.2 pct, he said, compared to to a 0.4\npct rise for year-over-year sales through February.\n    \"You can see a pattern developing,\" Maude said. \"I wouldn't\nbe surprised to see a fall-off in March, especially since sales\nprobably won't be boosted by auto sales as they were in\nFebruary.\"\n    Despite the weak underlying trend, economists were\nimpressed by a robust 1.5 pct gain in total sales excluding\nautos in February.

I will work to reach\nthat solution,\" he said in the interview conducted in Paris.\n    An EC decision to impose tariffs on Gulf petrochemical\nexports over a set quota has strained trade relations between\nthe two sides.\n    GCC members Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, the UAE\nand Oman are threatening to impose heavy customs duties on\nEuropean exports to the Gulf if no solution is reached.\n    Raimond said negotiations between the two groups took a\nlong time because there were 20 countries involved. But added:\n\"Time is now ripe and all circumstances are appropriate for\nmaking crucial progress.\"\n    Referring to the Iran-Iraq war, he said efforts should\ncontinue to find a solution despite prevailing difficulties.\n    He said France was continuing negotiations with Iran. Some\nproblems were solved as a result of the contacts while others\nremained unresolved. He gave no details but said: \"France wishes\nto have normal relations with Iran.\"\n REUTER\n",

But economists said that\nseasonal factors make it hard to assess what spur to the\neconomy, if any, will come from housing in coming months. And\nafter a steady retreat, mortgage rates seem to be near bottom.\n    U.S. housing starts rose 2.6 pct in February to a\nseasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.851 mln units from 1.804\nmln in January. It was the highest pace for starts since April\n1986.\n    The rate at which permits were issued for future building\nclimbed 4.4 pct to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.764\nmln units after dropping 11.52 pct to 1.690 mln in January.\n    \"February's weather is usually more adverse for home\nbuilding. Because of seasonal factors it's difficult to\ndetermine what this means for the economy down the road,\" said\nAllan Leslie of Discount Corp.\n    The housing report is seasonally-weighted to compensate for\nweather-related setbacks. As a result, milder temperatures\ninflate the statistics.\n    Economists said that low mortgage rates also were a spur to\nbuilding last month. But several believe that rates will now\nconsolidate before edging up in late spring/early summer.\n    \"Builders are looking at current mortgage rates and saying\n'Let's do it now',\" said Mark Obrinsky of the U.S. League of\nSavings Institutions in Washington, whose members supply much\nof the financing for home building.\n    But Obrinsky doubts that there is much more downward\npotential for rates because he foresees higher inflation and \nsome overall improvement in the U.S. economy.\n    He expects rates to gain 50 to 100 basis points in early\nsummer from the 9.50 pct fixed rate effective in February. Last\nNovember, fixed rate mortgages were about 10.30 pct.\n    As expected, the strength in housing was concentrated in\nthe single-family sector. The multi-family area -- which\ntypically represents rental units -- remained weak due to high\nvacancy rates and increased capital costs of such units\nfollowing tax law changes effective January 1.\n    Single-family starts rose at a 5.6 pct annual pace to 1.317\nmln units. Multi-family fell 4.1 pct to a 534,000 rate.\n    \"Strength in the single-family sector indicates that low\nmortgage rates are doing their job. But we're probably not\nlooking at a great deal of growth potential,\" said Ward\nMcCarthy of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.\n    McCarthy noted that the housing report, together with\nlarger than expected gains in U.S. employment, industrial\noutput and retail sales in February, may cause some observers\nto start waving \"four pct GNP banners\" for the first quarter.\nGross national product grew 1.3 pct in the fourth quarter.\n    But McCarthy, who still expects first quarter real GNP to\ncome in at an annual rate of 2.5 pct or slightly above, is not\nconvinced that growth will pick up in future.\n    \"The big story is the inventory re-building that's going on\nnow, not all of which is intentional,\" he said. For example,\nU.S. automakers, who are already saddled with high stocks,\nproduced at an annual rate of 8.3 mln units in February\ncompared with domestic car sales of 7.3 mln.\n    Thus while inventories could contribute to GNP in the first\nquarter, they may result in scaled-back production and weaker\ngrowth in the second, he said.\n    \"If most of the first quarter growth is inventory building\nand we cannot identify any improvement in export demand, then\nthere is the potential for softness in the second quarter,\"\nagreed Allan Leslie of Discount Corp. He is still evaluating\nfirst quarter GNP prospects.\n    Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker said last week that\ncurrent data do not show the worsening in trade has reversed.\n    \"At the same time that we are pumping up inventories in the\nfirst quarter, we could foresee production slowing in the\nsecond,\" cautioned Joe Plocek of McCarthy, Crisanti and Maffei\nInc, who expects first quarter growth of about three pct.\n Reuter\n",

This followed a 0.6 pct\nrise in the PPI in January.\n    \"The Fed is going to look at this positively,\" said Allan\nLeslie of Discount Corporation. \"Certainly inflation is not as\nbad as what Volcker (Fed Chairman) has said lately. Industrial\nproduction growth is along the lines of what the Fed wants.\"\n    The energy products component of PPI rose 4.0 pct in\nFebruary, after a 9.8 pct increase in January.\n    \"This shows that the impact of energy prices on inflation\nis behind us in terms of the move from 15 dlrs to 18 dlrs per\nbarrel,\" said Maria Ramirez of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. \"The\ntrend is still 3.5 pct in the first half of the year.\"\n    In 1986, declining energy prices contributed to a 2.5 pct\ndecline in the PPI.\n    Economists said that a rise in energy prices was expected,\nbut a sharp drop in auto prices was not. Passenger car prices\nfell 3.4 pct and light truck prices dropped 1.3 pct.\n    Yesterday, Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker said that\na possibility of renewed inflation remains a concern in both\nthe financial markets and the Federal Reserve.\n    \"The Fed may be lowering its own inflation expectations\ntoday,\" said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities International.\n    While low inflation permits the Fed to maintain an easier\nmonetary policy, Brusca said if import prices do not rise this\ncould necessitate a weaker dollar.\n    \"The outlook for the dollar is still up in the air,\" he\nsaid. \"We need inflation for U.S. producers to compete with\nforeign producers.\"\n    Brusca said prices of electronic equipment dropped 0.8 pct\nin February's PPI. With many electronic goods produced\noverseas, this may show that foreign producers are not raising\nprices which bodes ill for U.S. competitiveness, he said.\n    If further dollar declines are needed, this could diminish\noverseas investment in U.S. debt, Brusca added, which might\nnecessitate higher interest rates and lower bond prices.\n    By contrast, Slifer said imported goods prices rose 11.8\npct from first quarter 1985 to first quarter 1986 reflecting to\na large degree a 22 pct drop in the trade-weighted real value\nof the dollar from February 1985 to February 1987.\n    Slifer said import prices may rise further as\nmanufacturers' contracts put in place before the dollar dropped\nto current levels expire, and new contracts are made that\nreflect a weaker dollar.\n    David Wyss of Data Resources Inc noted that imported\nmanufactured goods prices rose 8.5 pct at an annual rate in the\nsecond half of 1986, which has contributed to rising U.S.\nindustrial output.\n    \"It's the other side of the lower dollar,\" Wyss said.\n\"Producers are beginning to find themselves more competitive\nand they are increasing output.\"\n    Wyss said that the latest data point to an average\nindustrial production gain of 0.3-0.4 pct in the first quarter.\n\"It's an encouraging sign that the manufacturing sector is\nbeginning to revive.\"\n    But Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley and Co Inc was not \nconvinced that the February reports portend economic gains. He\nsaid much of the strength came from factors that do not point\nto a sustained rise in industrial output.\n    Roach pointed out that stikers returning to work in farm\nequipment industries helped account for a one pct rise in\nFebruary business equipment production.\n    Utilities output rose 0.7 pct in February after gaining 1.2\npct in January, but Roach said it shows mostly that more energy\nwas produced, not that manufacturing activity gained.\n    Finally, he pointed out that auto production accounted for\nhalf of the industrial production gain as production of auto\nassemblies rose to 8.3 million units at an annual rate from 7.5\nmillion units.\n    \"In the first quarter, it looks like automakers are\nproducing at an 8.5 mln unit annual rate, but selling at\nroughly a seven mln unit rate,\" Roach said. \"The disparity\nbetween output and sales is showing up in inventories.\"\n    Economists pointed to sharp rise in January U.S. business\ninventories as a sign that production may be outstripping\ndemand in the first quarter of 1987.\n    January business inventories rose 0.9 pct, the largest gain\nsince July 1979 when inventories rose 1.7 pct, the Commerce\nDepartment said. Business sales dropped 4.5 pct in January, the\nlargest monthly sales drop on record.\n    Nonetheless, economists do not expect the Fed to react to\nmonth-to-month changes. \"The Fed has been standing pat for the\nlast seven months,\" Ramirez said. \"They will continue to stand\npat for at least the next couple of months.\"\n Reuter\n",

Some traders and analysts expect limit declines in\nnearby contracts, with spillover selling likely in cattle.\n    University of Missouri agronomist Glen Grimes said,\"The\nreport shows that hog producers have responded to a very\ndesirable feeding ratio that they enjoyed for the past 10\nmonths.\"\n    Shearson Lehman analyst Chuck Levitt said hog futures\nprices are above producers' break even points. Even if futures\nfell the daily limit of 1.50 cents today, producers could still\nlock in a profit, which increases the likelihood of heavy\nselling pressure today.\n    \"We have not had a period of profitability of this\nmagnitude since last summer,\" Levitt said. \"In fact, hog\noperations on many mixed livestock/grain enterprises have been\nso profitable that it actually enabled some farmers to get back\non their feet and refinance their loans just based on the hog\noperation alone.\"\n    Levitt said the weight breakdown in the report also was\nnegative, in that some lead time was anticipated before the\nslaughter increased from the previous year.\n    We expected farmers to increase hog operations, but we\ndidn't expect this degree of expansion to show up in a 10-state\nspring report, Levitt added.\n    High hog corn ratios (the number of bushels of corn that\ncould be bought for 100 lbs of hog) and the resulting increased\nprofits, encouraged farmers and confinement operations to\nincrease production starting late last year.\n    Analysts also noted that part of the increase in the hog\nherd resulted from a revision of the December report and\nwithout the revision, the March report might have been very\nclose to average expectations.\n    Robin Fuller of Agri Analysis said the USDA made a major\nupward revision of 105,000 head in the size of the breeding\nherd in the December 1 report. So the December report was more\nbearish than initially indicated.\n    But Fuller, as well as other analysts, expected the report\nto be less negative on deferred futures contracts. Distant\ncontracts are already at a sharp discount to cash because\ntraders anticipated high farrowing intentions, she noted.\n    Discounts in the October and December contracts take into\nconsideration a six to seven pct increase in March/May\nfarrowing intentions, which was borne out in the March 1\nreport, Fuller said.\n    Grimes said, \"As far as the distant months are concerned,\nif our first quarter pig crop is up only six pct and under 60\nlb inventories actually up only five pct, it would take a\ntremendous discount in price for each percent increase for us\nto push down to the prices that the current futures show for\nthe July and August period.\"\n    Jerry Abbenhaus, analyst for AGE Clearing noted that\ndistant futures prices are already 15 to 20 dlrs lower than\nthey were last summer.\n    \"If cash hogs at the 7-markets last year averaged 61 dlrs\nduring July, that doesn't mean hogs have to be 15 dlrs cheaper\nthis year because we have six pct more numbers,\" he said.\n Reuter\n",

However, he\nsaid new wage agreements in West Germany had raised inflation\nexpectations which would put upward pressure on interest rates\nin the longer term.\n    In the Netherlands, the inflation outlook for 1987 is nil,\nor even negative, while the latest official economic forecasts\npoint to a falling rate of economic growth.\n    \"It will depend on the outcome of collective wage agreement\nnegotiations here whether there could be cost push inflation,\"\nthe ABN economist said.\n    He said Dutch money supply growth, which ran at 3.4 pct in\nJanuary, could also contribute to some inflation.\n    At Amro Bank, a leading analyst said inflation could run to\ntwo pct next year. The bank expects Dutch capital market rates,\ncurrently averaging around 6.1 pct, to stop easing in the\nsecond half of this year and stabilize around 5.6 pct.\n    Analysts said an official rate cut could trigger a buying\nspree on the bond market which would bring yields down,\nprobably only temporarily, while money rates could fall below\nfive pct.\n    Currently, all periods are traded at 5.12 to 5.25 pct in\nthe money market.\n REUTER\n",

Even excluding volatile defense\ngoods, durable goods orders rose a healthy 3.8 pct, the agency\nsaid.\n    The February numbers surpassed the expectations of many\nfinancial analysts, whose predictions ranged from flat to\nincreases of up to five pct.\n    The January/February employment statistics suggest the\nGross National Product will show a healthy rate of growth for\nthe first three months of this year, said Lyle Gramley, an\neconomist with the Mortgage Bankers Association.\n    The U.S. jobless rate in February and January was 6.7 pct,\nthe lowest rate since March 1980. The number of new non-farm\njobs rose by 337,000 in February after a 319,000 gain in\nJanuary and a 225,000 December increase, the government said.\n    The employment data suggests a GNP annual growth rate of\nabout three to 3.25 pct in the first quarter, said Gramley.\n    Much of that will be attributed to businesses rebuilding\ntheir inventories and is not likely to be sustained in the\nsecond quarter, Gramley said. He expects a slowdown in the\nsecond quarter with smaller increases in personal consumption\nand government spending. He also sees residential construction\ndeclining mostly for multi-family housing units.\n    Fidelity Bank senior economist Mickey Levy said some of the\nfourth quarter slowness will continue.\n    Levy predicts GNP will grow at a scant 1.5 pct rate in the\nfirst quarter of 1987, accelerate during the second quarter and\nshow a brisk 4.5 pct annual rate in the third quarter.\n    The key to both forecasts is a marked improvement in the\nU.S. trade balance which is expected because of the decline in\nthe dollar's value over the last year and half.\n    \"The improvement will be gradual and long lasting,\" Levy\npredicted. Most of it will be through import reduction, but at\nleast one-third will be due to a rise in product exports as the\nprices of U.S. goods become more attractive overseas.\n    The Reagan administration has predicted the trade deficit,\nwhich soared to record levels last year, will improve this year\nand the U.S. economy will grow by a respectable 3.2 pct for the\nyear compared with a 2.5 pct rate last year.\n    As part of the effort to reduce the trade deficit, the U.S.\nhas been pressing West Germany and Japan to stimulate their\ndomestic demand for goods from the U.S. and others.\n    U.S. officials believe that would help take some of the\npressure off the United States whose five years of economic\ngrowth has been the mainstay of developing countries.\n    The U.S. economy provided them with a giant market for\ntheir goods giving them a way to earn income badly needed to\nservice their foreign debt.\n    The government last week said the U.S. economy grew at a\nmodest 1.1 pct annual rate during the fourth quarter.\n    There were indications of improvement in the huge imbalance\nbetween the volume of goods imported to the United States and\nthose shipped abroad. The report showed a rising volume of\nexports corresponding to a decline in imports despite the fact\nthat in current dollar terms, the U.S. trade deficit worsened\nduring the closing three months of 1986.\n    While fourth quarter economic growth was weak, corporate\nprofits jumped a healthy 6.1 pct during the period, the\ngovernment said. It also reported that inflation, as measured\nby the GNP price deflator, remained in check, growing a\nmoderate 0.7 pct in the period, the lowest rise in 19 years.\n    The government also reported that consumer spending, a key\nelement of the five year economic recovery, jumped 1.7 pct in\nFebruary, after falling two pct in January.\n    The Federal Reserve Board also reported that the\nmanufacturing sector, which had been one of the weaker elements\nof the U.S. economy, was showing signs of recovery.\n    In its latest report on current economic conditions, the\nFed said that economic activity in the various regions of the\ncountry ranged from uneven or steady to improving.\nManufacturing activity showed signs of improvement in most\nregions except Dallas where orders remained sluggish.\n    Chase Econometrics Chairman Lawrence Chimerine said the\npick up in the U.S. manufacturing sector is largely due to the\ndrop in the dollar's value. He said he does not foresee a major\npick up in economic activity, but does not believe the economy\nwill slip into recession either.\n    He said higher prices on imported products and wage cuts\nthat have helped the manufacturing sector will squeeze\nconsumers purchasing power.\n    \"That pattern is starting and will continue for a number of\nyears,\" Chimerine said.

Traders rushed into the spot, or\nunlimited, contract to offset those moves, analysts said.\n    As a result, O'Neill said, there was much confusion, many\nunmatched trades, and large losses for some traders.\n    The COMEX fined four large firms a total of 100,000 dlrs\nfor failure to resolve unmatched trades in a timely manner.\n    Paul Cain, a vice president at Shearson Lehman Brothers,\nsaid the elimination of price limits will cut back on panic\nbuying or selling and contribute to more orderly markets.\n    O'Neill added that the elimination of daily limits would\nadd caution to trading.\n    \"This is a more realistic approach because the metals\nmarket is a 24 hours market and prices can move without limit,\"\nO'Neill said.\n Reuter\n",

Money market sources said the market had begun\nto doubt that a widely expected drop in bank base lending rates\nto 9.5 pct from the present 10.0 pct was really on the cards.\n    But sentiment now looks to have turned about again.\n    There now looks to be no danger that the Chancellor of the\nExchequer Nigel Lawson's forecast of a 1987 current account\ndeficit of 2.5 billion stg will be exceeded, said Wroblewski.\n    Seasonally adjusted figures showed that imports rose in\nFebruary to 7.16 billion stg from 6.73 billion in January.\n    Exports rose to a record 6.93 billion from 6.20 billion.\n    However, Chris Tinker, U.K. Analyst at brokers Phillips and\nDrew said that the faster rise in exports than imports would\nprove partly aberrational in coming months. He forecast the\nChancellor's Budget tax cuts would increase consumer expediture\non imported goods.\n    However, Ian Harwood, economist at Warburg Securities, said\nhis firm was sharply revising its 1987 current account deficit\nforecast in the light of the latest data, cutting one billion\nstg off the expected full year total to about 1.75 billion stg.\n    He said news of strong growth in exports of non-oil goods\nconfirmed recent bullish surveys among members of the\nConfederation of British Industry.\n    The growth in imports appears to be flattening, even if\nJanuary's bad weather had curbed consumer spending on overseas\ngoods and import-intensive stock building among manufactureres,\nHarwood said.\n    U.K. Government bonds, or gilts, surged by more than 1/2\npoint on the better-than-expected news, as earlier worries\nabout the figures evaporated.\n    Sterling peaked at a high of 1.6075 dlrs, before settling\nto a steady 1.6050 dlrs about 1300 GMT, nearly a cent higher\nthan the European low of 1.5960.\n    However, analysts noted that the turnabout in market\nsentiment still looks highly vulnerable to political news.\n    Morning weakness in sterling and the gilt market was\nlargely attributed to a newspaper opinion poll showing that the\nConservative government's support was slipping.\n    The Marplan poll, published in \"Today,\" showed Conservative\nsupport had fallen to 36 pct, from 38 pct last month, while the\nAlliance of Liberals and Social Democrats had rallied to 31\npct, from 21 pct, to run neck and neck with the Labour Party,\nwhose own support fell from 38 pct.\n    The poll was taken after the Budget, which was greeted\nenthusiastically by financial markets but seems to have left\nthe voters indifferent, political observers said.\n    Another regular poll is due tomorrow, and eonomists warn\nthat today's improved sentiment could be dented if support for\nPrime Minister Margaret Thatcher slips again.\n    This upsetting of the markets' political perceptions, which\nare all but discounting a Conservative victory in the upcoming\ngeneral election, made them more sensitive to the trade data,\nHarwood said. \"The news did come as a very, very substantial\nrelief,\" he said.\n    However, on the interest rate front, economists caution\nthat Lawson might be wary of leaving sterling vulnerable by\nencouraging another base rate fall. They noted Lawson had\nalready got an inflation-reducing cut in mortgage rates in\nresponse to lower base rates, so domestic political reasons for\nlower rates have been curtailed.\n REUTER\n",

June Canadian dollar closed at 0.7656 Tuesday.\n    Mills noted, however, that interest rate differentials\nbetween Canadian securities and U.S. securities have narrowed\ndramatically recently, with yields on 10-year Canadian bonds\nonly about 80 basis points above U.S. 10-year notes.\n    What has helped the Canadian currency, she noted, is an\nincreasing proportion of foreign funds flowing into the\nCanadian equity market, particularly from Japanese investors.\n    Other analysts, however, said currency futures may be near\nthe top of their long-term rally.\n    \"Something will be done at the (G-5 and G-7) meeting to\ncalm people,\" said David Horner of Merrill Lynch Economics.\n    The Paris accord has pretty much fixed where major European\ncurrencies will trade, Horner said.\n    But sterling futures may still make another run for new\nhighs, up to 1.6300 to 1.6500 dlr in the June contract, on the\npositive atmosphere that will prevail before British elections\nand possibly another interest rate cut, Horner said. The June\nBritish pound closed at 1.6080 on Tuesday.\n    Horner said that new boundaries for the trading range of\nthe yen are likely to come out of the G-5 and G-7 meetings.\n    The most likely range will be a bottom for the dollar\nbetween 140 to 142 yen per dollar and a top near 150 to 152\nyen, Horner said. In yen futures, the bottom of the dollar's\nrange would be equivalent to 0.007100 to 0.007150 in the June\ncontract. June yen closed at 0.006913 on Tuesday.\n    If such a range does emerge from the meetings, \"we will\nhave one more rally in the yen,\" Horner said.\n Reuter\n",

A lower dollar would harm the U.S. Economy, he\nnoted.\n    A Finance Ministry official who was directly involved in\nmonetary talks with other nations also said the U.S. Would\nnever attempt to lower the reference range for the dollar\nagainst the mark or the yen.\n    The market assumes the dollar reference range to be between\n140-150 yen and between 1.70 and 1.90 marks.\n    The dollar closed in Tokyo today at 1.7730/35 marks and\n141.35 yen.\n    \"Behind Baker's remark was U.S. Frustration over higher\ninterest rates abroad, especially in West Germany, but this\ndoes not represent its readiness to scrap the basic framework\nof the Louvre accord,\" the Finance Ministry official said.\n    He said that on the contrary Baker wanted to avoid any\nfurther rise in U.S. Interest rates because it would not only\nhurt the U.S. Economy but aggravate the Third World debt\nproblem.\n    Higher U.S. Interest rates would merely raise their\ninterest payment burden and depress U.S. Stock and bond markets\nfurther, the monetary officials said.\n    Both the ministry and central bank officials, who declined\nto be named, noted the U.S. No longer wants to see a further\ndecline of the dollar because that could also fan inflationary\nexpectations in the U.S.\n    \"That's why Baker did not fail to add that the Louvre\nagreement is still operative,\" the senior ministry official\nsaid.\n    Baker said in a U.S. Television interview on Sunday that\nWashington would reexamine the Louvre accord because of West\nGermany's increase in short-term interest rates.\n    The market at first interpreted this as indicating the U.S.\nWould be ready to scrap the Louvre accord and let the dollar\ndecline further unless surplus countries, notably West Germany,\ntry harder to stimulate their economies as pledged in the\naccord, foreign exchange dealers said.\n    But the market on reflection also noted Baker's additional\nstatement that \"the Louvre agreement is still operative,\" and\nthis caused some dollar short-covering in Tokyo today, the\ndealers said.\n    Uncertainty, however, remained the flavour of the day in\nTokyo currency markets.\n    The Japanese monetary officials said Baker's undisguised\npressure on West Germany to refrain from guiding interest rates\nhigher may be part of a process of multilateral surveillance,\nor international economic policy coordination.\n    The G-7, comprising the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain,\nFrance, Italy and Canada, have agreed to monitor each other's\neconomic policies and from time to time apply \"peer pressure\" to\npersuade others to change their policies to a desired course,\nthey noted. \"Without such a basic agreement of multilateral\nsurveillance, Baker would never have criticized the West German\npolicy so openly,\" the ministry official said.\n    The U.S.-West German squabble over Bonn's monetary policy\nshould thus be regarded as a process of healthy policy\ncoordination and not as any indication of a possible collapse\nof the Louvre agreement, the official said.\n    He also said Japan has not received any specific request\nfrom the U.S. On its monetary policy, although its short-term\nmoney rates have been edging higher.\n    \"This is because we, unlike the Germans, are not taking\npolicy to guide interest rates higher, and the marginal rate\nrise in recent days is primarily for seasonal reasons,\" he\nadded.\n REUTER\n",

This follows a\n319,000 gain in January, revised down from a previously\nreported 448,000 increase.\n    \"Even if you look at January and February together, this is\nstill a much stronger report than the consensus expectation in\nthe market,\" said Allan Leslie of Discount Corporation.\n    Economists stressed that gains in hours worked signal much\nlarger gains in February U.S. production and income than\npreviously forecast.\n    The average work week rose 0.2 hours to 35.0 hours from\n34.8 hours in January. The average manufacturing work week rose\n0.3 hours to 41.2 hours, the longest factory work week since\nNovember 1966, the Commerce Department said.\n    \"The gains in manufacturing employment point to a very\nlarge increase in industrial production of between 0.5 and 0.7\npct,\" said Joe Carson of Chemical Bank. This compares to a 0.4\npct  gain in January U.S. industrial production.\n    Peter Greenbaum of Smith Barney Harris Upham and Co Inc\nnoted that the average wage rate increased to 8.87 dlrs an hour\nin February from 8.83 dlrs in January.\n    \"Combined with the increase in hours worked, this means\nwe'll get a pretty healthy gain in personal income vis-a-vis\nthe wage and salary disbursement,\" he said.\n    Greenbaum said that February U.S. personal income should\nrise at least 0.5 pct after being flat in January.\n    He said the February employment gains are consistent with\nhis firm's first quarter U.S. real gross national product\ngrowth forecast of 3.7 pct.\n    Economists agreed that the employment data were negative\nfor the credit markets in that they signal a healthier economy\nand no easing in the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. But\nmost said that the market need not fear tighter policy either.\n    \"This report is another reason for the Fed to not consider\neasing,\" said Ray Stone of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc.  \n  \"It gives them more room to address the dollar situation,\" he\nsaid. \"If they had to nudge policy tighter, they could do so,\nbut it's most likely they'll sit and wait.\"\n    \"The data have not been uniform,\" Stone added. \"Durable\ngoods were weak in January and now employment is strong.\"\n    In January, U.S. durable goods orders dropped 7.5 pct,\nfollowed by a 4.0 pct drop in U.S. factory goods orders. U.S.\nretail sales fell 5.8 pct, and the U.S. merchandise trade gap\nwidened to 14.8 billion dlrs.\n    \"Things just aren't adding up,\" said Steve Slifer of Lehman\nGoverment Securities Inc. \"Consumer spending, capital spending,\ngoverment spending, and net exports data show very weak first\nquarter GNP growth of one pct,\" he said.\n    \"The employment and production data point to a big\ninventory build-up, but that's what we thought in the fourth\nquarter and we only got 1.3 pct GNP growth.\"\n    Manufacturing employment gained 50,000 after falling 15,000\nin January. Economists estimated that 30,000 of the gain was\naccounted for by striking workers in the steel and machinery\nindustries returning to work.\n    Even so, some economists said that the manufacturing gains\nhave resulted from an improving trade outlook.\n    Jason Benderly of Goldman, Sachs and Co noted that the U.S.\ntrade picture improved in the fourth quarter as net exports\ngrew at a 20 pct annual rate while the rate of increase in\nimports fell to only six pct, and that it continues to improve\nin the first quarter.\n    \"Not only the official statistics for the fourth quarter,\nbut evidence of a pick up in orders from overseas for paper\nproducts, chemicals, high-tech goods, and capital goods show\nthat trade is improving,\" Benderley said.\n    \"The economy is moving between extremes,\" he said. \"Some\nreports are going to look bad and some good, but first quarter\nGNP is going to grow in the middle at about three pct.\"\n    A 287,000 gain in services employment comprised the greater\npart of February's employment gain. Retail services employment\nrose 129,000 in February, compared to a gain of 117,000 in\nJanuary, previously reported at 166,000.\n    Construction employment rose a slim 2,000 in February. But\nthis follows a robust 113,000 gain in January, revised down\nfrom a previously reported 142,000 gain.\n    The U.S. civilian unemployment rate was unchanged in\nFebruary at 6.7 pct. This means the jobless rate has stayed at\n6.7 pct for three consecutive months, the lowest reading since\nMarch 1980, the Commerce Department noted.\n    \"The Federal Reserve has to be pleased with this report,\"\nCarson said. \"This takes away the Fed's flexibility to ease,\nbut there's no reason to tighten. It's way too early for that.\"\n      \n Reuter\n",
