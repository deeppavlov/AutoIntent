It closed at 1.8160/70 marks.\n    Viermetz also said he did not see the U.S. Federal funds\nrate falling below six pct for fear of provoking an\nuncontrolled fall in the dollar.\n    But at the same time, worries about the international debt\ncrisis would mean there was little chance of a rise above 6-3/4\npct since this would increase loan costs to the third world.\n    The Middle East foreign exchange conference brings together\nmore than 200 traders and bank treasury chiefs from the Arab\nworld and Arab banks in European and U.S. Financial centres.\n    Formal discussions, which end today, have also centred on\nthe role of Arab banks in world financial markets, with bankers\nurging them to adapt to a new global trend towards\nsecuritisation of  business.\n    Hikmat Nashashibi, President of the Arab Bankers\nAssociation, said Arab banks have to shake off their old\nmentality of commercial banking and concentrate more on\ninvestment banking.\n REUTER\n",

There's no real\nreason for it to change policy,\" said Joseph Liro of S.G.\nWarburg and Co Inc.\n    Liro said the economy is showing moderate growth and does\nnot require immediate policy easing and the money aggregates\nmay well end March at the bottom of their target ranges.\n    All of the economists agreed that the Fed's major concern\nnow is recent weakness in the dollar which early this week was\nheavily supported by central banks. They said fear of hurting\nthe dollar will cause the Fed to be cautious in lowering\ninterest rates further.\n    Numbers released by the Fed today were all in line with\nexpectations and similar to the data for most of this year.\n    The Fed said that banks' net free reserves averaged 603 mln\ndlrs in the two-week statement period that ended on Wednesday\nversus 749 mln dlrs in the previous period.\n    In the single week to Wednesday, banks' borrowings at the\ndiscount window, less extended credits, averaged 302 mln dlrs\ncompared with 228 mln dlrs in the first week of the statement\nperiod. Meanwhile the Federal funds rate average edged up to\n6.14 pct from 6.08 pct.\n    The Fed's failure to add reserves in the market on Tuesday\nand Wednesday surprised some, but economists said the data\nreleased today suggest it had no real need to add reserves.\n    The Fed's absence may be explained by the lack of any\npressing need for it to supply reserves and by a desire to\nboost borrowings in the second week of the statement period to\nmeet its borrowings target, said Liro of Warburg.\n    Liro said the Fed probably is shooting for a two-week\nborrowings average of 300-325 mln dlrs. The borrowings actually\naveraged 265 mln dlrs in the latest statement period and that\nwas up from 191 mln dlrs in the prior period.\n    Brusca of Nikko agreed that the Fed probably is aiming for\ntwo-week average discount window borrowings of around 300 mln\ndlrs. He said that would correspond to a Federal funds rate of\naround 6.10 pct.\n    It is nearly impossible for the Fed to hit any borrowings\ntarget since the demand for excess reserves is erratic, said\nWells Fargo's Nathan. He said the Fed is focusing instead on\nthe funds rate and is trying to keep it roughly within a six to\n6-1/4 pct band.\n    Upward funds rate pressure and a big reserve-adding need\nare anticipated for the statement period that began today.\n More\n    Brusca believes the Fed will have to add 3.5 to four\nbillion dlrs a day in reserves in this statement period. Liro\nputs the add need at around 3.9 billion dlrs.\n    To partly address this requirement, many expect the Fed to\nadd permanent reserves with effect next Thursday by offering to\nbuy all maturities of Treasury bills on Wednesday. A similar\ncoupon \"pass\" may be required later.\n    There will be a greater demand for funds in this statement\nperiod because it includes the close of the quarter. Further\nupward pressure on the Federal funds rate may come from window\ndressing demand as the Japanese fiscal year ends on March 31.\n Reuter\n",

Privately, some bank\nofficials forecast the Bank will hold out at least for this\nweek, but at least one bank says a rise is possible tomorrow.\nIf a move comes before March 17, forecasts are for a half-point\ncut, with another half or full point about Budget day.\n REUTER\n",

However, the sources noted\na late temporao is always more susceptible to pod rot, which\nflourishes if conditions turn cold and humid, and which is more\nlikely from late July on.\n    This year's crop is doubly susceptible because poor prices\nmean farmers were not encouraged to invest in fertilisers and\ninsecticides and are also unlikely to treat against pod rot.\n    A severe attack of pod rot can cause the loss of over\n500,000 bags in a very short period, one source said.\n    Because of the increased exposure to pod rot damage,\nestimates of the final outcome of the temporao are extremely\nvulnerable and production could easily drop to below the 2.0\nmln bag mark if the disease hits.\n    Although flowering was good following the start of the\nrains, pod setting was not up to expectations, possibly because\nthe drought had caused a drop in the insect population which\npollinates flowers, the sources said.\n    However, reports from farms indicate moisture levels are\nnow generally back to near normal levels and that current\nflowering and pod setting is good, which should result in\nmature fruit from August through September.\n    The sources said they expect no break in the harvesting of\nbeans between the end of the temporao and the beginning of the\nmain crop, which officially starts on October 1.\n    \"The cut-off date is completely artificial. If things go\nwell from now on we should see heavy harvesting without a break\nfrom August through November or even December,\" one said.\n    If predictions of a 2.0 to 2.5 mln bag temporao prove\naccurate this would be below the 2.7 mln bag average for the\npast 10 years. The last poor temporao was in 1984 when\nprolonged drought and later pod rot cut production to 1.79 mln\nbags, the lowest since 1974.\n    Good growing conditions the following year produced a\ntemporao of 3.12 mln bags, just below the 1983 3.17 mln bag\nrecord, while last year's output, which also suffered some\ndrought damage, was 2.77 mln bags.\n    Figures for the coming temporao might be distorted upwards\nby the inclusion of undeclared current main crop beans.\n    The sources said large quantities of beans are believed to\nhave been undeclared from this year's record total harvest and\nthey were unsure how much of this would be unregistered by the\nend of the official crop year on April 30.\n    Recent official arrivals figures have been swollen by the\ninclusion of beans which had been delivered previously to port\nwarehouses but not declared.\n    Because of the high turnover of beans this year,\nsignificant amounts have deteriorated because they were stored\ntoo long at the back of warehouses. Some of these are expected\nto be held for mixing in with early temporao arrivals.\n    With official arrivals figures for the 1986/87 temporao and\nmain crops totalling over 6.1 mln bags, and over seven weeks\nstill to go to the end of the year, the total outturn should be\nat least a record 6.5 mln bags if all production is declared,\nthe sources said.\n    This would compare with the previous record set last year\nof 6.03 mln.\n    However, there is no way of telling how many current crop\nbeans will be declared after the May 1 start of the temporao\nand thus the true size of the 1986/87 harvest may never be\nofficially registered.\n Reuter\n",

The five institutes had jointly forecast\nthree pct 1987 growth in October last year.\n    Taking a dissenting view, the DIW institute of West Berlin\nand Munich's Ifo institute predicted only one pct 1987 growth.\n    The joint report said that the estimates of economic\ndevelopment made by the DIW and Ifo were \"markedly less\nfavourable\" than those of the other three.\n    The DIW and Ifo forecast the economy would pick up after a\nslow start to the year. \"In the second half of 1987 there will,\nhowever, only be a weak upward movement,\" they said.\n    The two institutes said external economic factors which\nwere currently damaging exports and pushing up imports would\ndominate the economic environment throughout the year. They saw\nexports falling by a real 2-1/2 pct in 1987 and predicted no\nmarked improvement in the course of the year.\n    The other three institutes, however, wrote: \"The decline in\ndemand and production (seen) in the winter months does not\nindicate the beginning of a cyclical downswing.\"\n    They said the sharp rise of the mark had led to corporate\nuncertainty and companies had not carried out investment plans.\nBut they expected that many investments had not been cancelled\nbut only put off. \"It can be presumed that the braking actions\n(on the economy) will diminish markedly this year.\"\n    They added: \"The domestic prerequisites for a continuation\nof the economic uptrend are still favourable.\"\n    These three institutes said diminishing external burdens\ncombined with favourable domestic conditions meant an upturn in\ndemand and production could be expected by the spring.\n    However, this projection was clouded by risks including the\nfurther development of the mark against the dollar.\n    Contrary to the DIW and Ifo, the three institutes said that\nwhile exports would continue to be the weak point of the\neconomy in 1987, \"there is good reason to believe that exports\nwill soon bottom out and that a slight rise will emerge during\nthe course of the year.\" They predicted an overall 0.5 pct fall\nin exports in 1987, the same as in 1986.\n    The three more positive institutes saw private consumption\nrising by four pct in 1987, compared with 4.2 pct in 1986,\nwhile DIW and Ifo predicted a three pct increase.\n    They saw the climate for equipment investment improving but\npredicted only a rise of four pct in 1987 against 4.6 pct in\n1986. Ifo and DIW saw these investments rising by only two pct.\n    All the institutes predicted only a slight decline in\nunemployment. The Kiel, Hamburg and Essen institutes said the\njobless total would average 2.17 mln in 1987 compared with 2.23\nmln in 1986 and predicted a rise in the number of people in\nwork of about 200,000.\n    These three institutes said new jobs would be created\nmainly in the private services sector and also by the state in\nthe context of job creation measures. The construction industry\nwas likely to engage new workers for the first time since 1980\nbut they predicted either no rise in employment in the\nmanufactured goods industry or only a slight expansion.\n    The DIW and Ifo said rises in employment would occur only\nin the tertiary sector, while \"the number employed in the\nmanufacturing industry will decline.\"\n    The DIW and Ifo said unemployment would only decline to\n2.20 mln in 1987 from 2.23 mln in 1986.\n    They saw the current account surplus falling in 1987 to 58\nbillion marks from 78 billion in 1986. The other three saw a\ncurrent account surplus in 1987 of at least 60 billion marks\nand predicted that the trade surplus would fall to only around\n100 billion marks from 112 billion in 1986.\n    The institutes agreed that consumer prices would start to\nrise in 1987, after they declined in 1986, and all five\npredicted an average increase over the year of 0.5 pct.\n REUTER\n",

Taken together, the four\nAmerican-led warrant issues raised only about 50 mln Swiss\nfrancs.\n    But banks believe the vehicle meets a need of investors and\npredicted a lively future.\n    Andrew Barrett of Citicorp Investment Bank (Switzerland) AG\nsaid: \"The warrants give smaller investors a chance to have a\nlong-term investment in gold with limited risk.\"\n    Citicorp in Zurich launched the first of these warrants on\nFebruary 27, following it up with a second issue less than a\nweek later. The issuer in both cases was Citibank NA.\n    The idea found some quick copies. Goldman Sachs in Zurich\norganized and co-led an issue for the Swiss branch of Banque\nIndosuez on March 9 and last night Morgan Guaranty\n(Switzerland) AG did another for Morgan Guaranty Trust Co of\nNew York.\n    The four issues now offer investors striking prices for\ngold ranging from the Indosuez issue at 410 dlrs an ounce, the\nsame price as the underlying commodity, to a 430 dlr level on\nthe first one for Citibank.\n    The premiums range from 22 pct to 36 pct and maturities\nfrom 18 months to four years and three months, in all cases\nlonger than gold futures and options on U.S. Markets.\n    The bankers traced the inspiration for the market back to\nthe February report of U.S. Consumer prices for January, when a\njump of 0.7 pct raised again the threat of inflation.\n    \"Many people are worried about inflation again,\" said Mats\nJoensson of Goldman Sachs. \"Money supply in Germany and the\nUnited States has grown very strongly in the last year and\npeople want to take a ride on gold.\"\n    The gold market, having seen strong gains in 1986, has\nlanguished just above 400 dlrs an ounce over the past few\nweeks. But the banks saw in warrants the vehicle for a more\nhighly leveraged play where the downside risk was limited.\n    Barrett said it was natural that the market developed in\nSwitzerland. \"People here understand gold, and they understand\nwarrants,\" he said.\n    Citicorp (Switzerland) pioneered warrants with a series of\nequity-linked covered issues based on Japanese company shares\nover the past two years, and last autumn, Swiss banks launched\ncovered warrants in Swiss registered shares in a bid to give\nforeign investors a chance to play in a market otherwise closed\nto all but Swiss citizens, and to play it with higher leverage.\n    But after a quick flurry of issues, that market dried up\nwhen Swiss shares prices fell from their January peaks.\n    The issues are being marketed not on the basis of simple\npremiums, but on implicit volatility models devised to provide\nscientific comparisons between titles in the options market.\n    Martin Bachem of Morgan Guaranty said his bank's issue was\ncompetitive despite its relatively high premium. The issue, for\nfive ounces at 425 dlrs, was priced at 955 Swiss francs, making\na premium over the spot gold price of nearly 36 pct.\n    Using a Black Sholes options model, he said the issue's\nlong, 4.3-year maturity meant the warrants needed an implicit\nvolatility of gold of only 24.5 pct for the option to pay off,\nwhich he claimed was lower than the other issues.\n    But Barrett said the Black Sholes variant Citicorp used\npointed to a higher volatily for the Morgan issue and\nemphasized that the models were at best an inexact science.\n    And each bank, using its own model, put the implicit\nvolatility needed for its own issue at close to 25 pct.\n    Whatever the calculation, the issues have received a warm\nwelcome from investors.\n    Joensson of Goldman Sachs said there was a lot of demand,\neven among small investors, who were buying 15 or 20 warrants\napiece. \"The most sophisticated ones wouldn't buy these because\nthe premiums are too high,\" he said.\n REUTER\n",

But there is no\nway they can trade their way out of this situation,\" Aldo\nRoldan, Vice President for International Services at Chase\nEconometrics, said.\n    Roldan told Reuters that Brazil not only had to tackle the\nproblems of satisfying domestic demand and competing on glutted\nworld markets, but also had to work to make its position on\nforeign exchange markets more profitable.\n    \"Domestic costs have increased (due to inflation) and\nexporters have not had the same offsetting movement in exchange\nrates,\" Roldan said.\n    The Chase economist also said commodities markets were\ndepressed and generally did not appear very promising for a\ncountry like Brazil, where pure commodities account for some 50\npct of exports and in 1986 had a total value of around 23\nbillion dlrs.\n    But he added: \"They are always pretty aggressive and they\nhave good foreign marketing channels.\"\n    Analysts said a key factor in Brazilian trade will be\ncoffee, and even without background pressure from foreign\ncreditors the world's largest producer was expected to hit the\nmarket this year with a vengeance.\n    Negotiations between International Coffee Organization\n(ICO) members to re-establish producer export quotas broke up\nearlier this week with major producers and consumers accusing\neach other of intransigence.\n    \"Brazil would not tolerate a change in ICO regulations,\nwhich others wanted changed,\" one senior coffee dealer said.\n    The dealer, who declined to be named, said Brazil wanted to\npreserve its market share. At the end of the talks, he said\nBrazil hinted it could sell more than anyone else and others\nwould suffer.\n    Brazil will be an aggressive seller under any scenario but\nas yet there is no sign of unusually heavy Brazilian sales, the\ndealer said.\n    \"If they do come into the market at this level it will go\nlower and you could breach a dollar, ninety or eighty cents,\"\nhe said.\n    New York coffee futures for May delivery settled 2.29 cents\nlower Thursday at 104.68 cents a lb, while more distant\ndeliveries fell the six-cent maximum trading limit.\n    President of the Brazilian Coffee Institute, Jorio Dauster\ntold a press conference in Rio de Janeiro today that Brazil has\nno set target for its coffee exports following the breakdown of\nthe ICO talks on export quotas.\n    Many economists and analysts believe soybeans could be the\nfocus of possible stepped-up Brazilian marketing efforts. \"They\nwill be more aggressive this year than they have ever been,\"\naccording to Richard Loewy, analyst for Prudential-Bache\nSecurities Inc.\n    Loewy believes the foreign debt problem, a good crop, plus\ndifficulties with storage would help motivate selling of the\nBrazil soybean crop. \"Brazilian farmers also need cash flow and\nthey can't afford to store the crops,\" he said.\n    The Chicago soybean complex has been nervous for some time\nabout large South American crops developing under near ideal\nconditions towards record yields.\n    \"We are going to see a very rapid decline, earlier than\nusual, this year in our (U.S.) exports,\" Loewy said.\n    Tommy Eshleman, economist for the American Soybean\nAssociation (ASA), said this year's Brazilian soybean harvest\ncould total 18 mln tonnes, versus 13.7 mln last year.\n    Marketings will be very aggressive this summer when prices\nare usually high relative to the rest of the year due to the\nvulnerability of the U.S. crop to bad growing weather.\n    Another incentive to sell might be trade anticipation of a\nreduction in the U.S. government soybean loan rate, offered to\nfarmers who give crops as collateral, Eshleman said.\n    He said there has been some uncertainty this year about the\nsoybean loan rate, which acts as an effective floor for prices\nby keeping supplies away from the free market. Farmers can\nforfeit their beans to the government rather than repay the\nloan.\n    \"We're getting into a period when they (Brazil) are\nstarting to harvest and starting to export,\" Eshleman said. But\nhe added it will be a while before U.S. exports fall to below\n10 mln bushels a week from around 20 mln bushels currently.\n    Jose Melicias from the research department of Drexel\nBurnham Lambert said Brazil would be trying to export as much\nas it can this year because of its economic situation.\n    He said the debt situation was a major consideration. \"The\nBrazilian government also does not have enough money to pay for\nstorage,\" he added.\n    Asked if a return to an inflationary environment in Brazil\nwould make farmers inclined to hold onto crops, Melicias said\nit would not make a big difference.\n    On other commodity markets, Brazil's selling impact may be\nmuted no matter its need to generate capital.\n    Brazil is faced with a poor 1986/87 sugar harvest, which\ncould limit exports to the world market, analysts said. The\ncountry may have oversold and be unable to honor export\ncommitments, and this plus higher domestic demand caused by\nconsumer price subsidies on ethanol and refined sugar, will\ngive it little room to stretch exports, they said.\n    Brazil's other major crop, cocoa, is in its third year of\nsurplus. \"Cocoa consumption is basically flat and last year it\nfell, so I don't think they can start throwing out cocoa and\nfind many more markets for it,\" one analyst said.\n    \"If they come out as aggressive sellers, the market would\ncollapse and they can't afford to do that,\" she added.\n Reuter\n",

I don't believe Lawson is mad enough to tie\nhimself to a fixed rate,\" Brett said.\n    Currency markets were keen for official statements to\nclarify the scope of the Paris accord and reactivate currency\ntrading. This mood easily led to over-reaction, analysts said.\n    \"Making similar statements when the market is high strung\nand ready to bounce is perhaps a mistake,\" one senior dealer\nwith a U.S. Bank said.\n    Capel's Skeoch said, \"it gives the foreign exchange markets\nsomething to shoot at.\"\n    \"It is obvious that the government, as a member of the Group\nof Six, has agreed exchange rate bands. But they are not cut in\nstone, they can change with time,\" Skeoch said.\n    Brett said, \"we think the 2.90 marks level is a central\nrate. Give or take 10 pfennigs and all is fine.\"\n    Not all analysts played down the significance of the\nremarks, however. Chris Dunn, economist at Royal Bank of\nCanada, said the remarks may signal a decisive move to insulate\nsterling from the fortunes of the dollar.\n    Although about two-thirds of Britain's trade is conducted\nwith European countries, sterling has traditionally shadowed\nthe dollar rather than the mark, analysts noted.\n    \"Britain must decide whether it wants to follow the U.S. Or\nthrow in its lot with Europe,\" Dunn said.\n    \"It suggests that while the U.K. Is not actually applying to\njoin the European Monetary System, it is seeking protection by\nshadowing it ... The Bundesbank has made it clear that it wants\nthe U.K. To clarify its position relative to the mark,\" he said.\n    Analysts said sterling's dip on currency markets following\nLawson's remarks made an early half-point cut in U.K. Base\nrates from current 10 pct levels unlikely in the short term.\n    \"Over the next three weeks, a cut is out, unless we get some\nextremely good economic indicators,\" Capel's Skeoch said.\n    Base rates have been cut twice by one-half point in March,\nthe last after the March 17 budget presentation, and analysts\nhad been expecting another half point cut shortly afterwards.\n REUTER\n",

The new INRA is to\nreplace the current one which expires in October.\n    Delegates at the renegotiation conference, held under the\nauspices of the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development\n(UNCTAD), reached agreement over the central elements of a new\naccord last weekend.\n    Xuto said the new INRA retains the reference price -- of\n201.66 Malaysian/Singapore cents per kilo -- and indicative\nprices set in the present pact.\n    Price levels will continue to be expressed in the joint\nMalaysian/Singapore currency, he added.\n    The new agreement also maintains the basic structure of\nprice ranges -- the \"may sell\" and \"may buy\" points at plus and\nminus 15 pct of the reference price, as well as the \"must sell\"\nand \"must buy\" zones at plus and minus 20 pct of it.\n    Xuto said the new pact maintains the same objectives that\nwere set in the present accord. \"The most important of these are\nto stabilise prices and to achieve a balanced growth between\ndemand and supply,\" he said. The buffer stock remains the sole\ninstrument of market intervention for price stabilisation and\nits maximum capacity is unchanged at 550,000 tonnes, Xuto\nadded.\n    At this month's session, which was the fourth attempt in\ntwo years to negotiate a new INRA, the main issue to be\nresolved concerned the mechanism for adjusting the reference\nprice.\n    It was agreed to conduct reviews of the reference price\nevery 15 months -- instead of the current 18-month intervals.\n    The extent of the adjustment was also modified.\n    Under the present agreement if the daily market indicator\nprice has been above the upper intervention (\"may sell\") price\n(currently 231 Malaysian/Singapore cents) or below the lower\nintervention price (\"may buy\") price (171 cents at present) for\nsix months, the reference price is then revised by five pct or\nwhatever amount the International Natural Rubber Council\ndecides.\n    Under the new pact, the adjustment under these\ncircumstances will be five pct unless the Council decides on a\nhigher adjustment.\n    Similarly, when buffer stock purchases or sales amount to\n300,000 tonnes, there would be an automatic adjustment of three\npct under the new accord unless the Council decides on a higher\npercentage.\n    Throughout the talks, which began on March 9, producers had\nstrongly opposed a consumer proposal to lower the reference\nprice and the \"lower indicative price\" (or floor price) of 150\ncents in the present pact if the buffer stock, currently\n360,000 tonnes, reached 450,000 tonnes.\n    The proposal, initiated by the U.S., was withdrawn last\nFriday, setting the stage for compromise at the weekend.\n    Since then negotiators have worked on the finer details of\nthe new pact.\n    On the question of conditions for entry into force of the\nnew INRA, Xuto said it was tentatively agreed that governments\naccounting for 75 pct of world exports and 75 pct of world\nimports approved or ratified the new agreement before it became\noperational.\n    The present agreement had a figure of 80 pct.\n Reuter\n",

Those\namendments affecting imports face an uncertain future because\nthe House Ways and Means Committee, which has overall\njurisdiction over trade legislation, will oppose them,\nCongressional sources said.\n    The effect of the EEP amendments would be to extend the\nlife of the program five years through fiscal 1990 rather than\nthe current three years through fiscal 1988.\n    The amendments, offered by Rep.

The amendment, offered\nby Rep. Arlan Stangeland, R-Minn., is aimed primarily at\ncurbing imports from Canada of products containing sugar and\nforeign foods containing dairy products. It also may affect\npeanut, cotton and tobacco imports, Committee sources said.\n    Another amendment would place a quota on U.S. imports of\ncasein, a dairy product shipped to the U.S. primarily by New\nZealand and Ireland.\n    The panel also voted to apply to lamb imports the same\ncountercyclical import quota law which is operating for U.S.\nbeef imports.\n    Other miscellaneous amendments included:\n    -- Urging the administration consider retaliating against\nJapan and South Korea if those countries do not remove\nrestrictions on beef imports.\n    -- Boosting the amount of U.S. grain which must be shipped\neach year under a food aid program called Section 416 to\n800,000 tonnes from 500,000 tonnes now.\n    -- Requiring the Agriculture Secretary conduct a study of\nthe Canadian Wheat Board import licensing system for wheat to\ndetermine if it is a non-tariff trade barrier.\n    -- Requiring the Agriculture Secretary reimburse the\nNational Corn Growers Association up to 500,000 dlrs for the\ncosts of defending the U.S. feedgrains program against a\nCanadian countervailing duty case this year.\n    -- Urging the administration oppose the Canadian decision\nto apply a duty on U.S. corn imports, and a proposal by the\nEuropean Community to apply a vegetable oils tax.\n    -- USDA conduct a study of the findings of a National\nCommission on Agricultural Export Policy, which recommended a\nreorganization of USDA's trade policy apparatus.\n Reuter\n",

The upper reaches of the\nYangtze are at their lowest levels in a century, causing many\nships to run aground, Wen Wei Po said.\n    Unusually high temperatures have also been reported across\nChina, media reports said.

This followed a 27.7 pct drop\nin January, previously reported as a 22.4 pct fall, due largely\nto the expiration of the sales tax deduction under new tax laws\nJanuary 1, the Commerce Department noted.\n    Some economists argued that the because the gain in total\nsales excluding autos also followed a decline in January, the\nstrength in the February report is less than impressive.\n    \"There is strength in the February data, but that's because\nthey were compared to low sales levels in January,\" said said\nBeth Reiners of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. \"We don't see it as a\nprecursor of continued strength.\"\n    Durable goods sales rose 8.8 pct in February, after falling\n17.7 pct in January.

An increase of some 2.3 billion dlrs is expected.    \n    Peter Greenbaum of Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co Inc\nexpects a one pct rise in income, led by a strong gain in wage\nand salary disbursements in February.\n    Nonfarm payrolls expanded by 337,000 jobs in February, the\naverage workweek lengthened by 0.6 pct and hourly wages rose by\nfour cts, he noted in a report. Vigorous spending on durable\ngoods last month, especially cars, foreshadow a rise of at\nleast 1.5 pct in consumption, he added.\n    The prospect of bearish data did not trouble the bond\nmarket much yesterday, with the 30-year Treasury bond slipping\njust 7/32 to 99-28/32 for a yield of 7.51 pct.\n    Analysts said the market is still trapped in a narrow\nrange, desperately seeking direction.\n    \"Seasonally adjusted, it's already December in the bond\nmarket,\" quipped Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co\nInternational Inc.\n    Paul Boltz of T. Rowe Price Associates Inc said the\nsteadiness of long bond yields around 7.5 pct, despite some\nsigns of a stronger economy, probably reflects expectations\nthat inflation will remain subdued.\n    But he warned that this assumption might not be justified.\n    \"It took the bond market a long while to see that inflation\nwas not returning to double digits, and now that it has learned\nthat lesson, it may be a little slow to see that a four to five\npct inflation is a real possibility ahead,\" Boltz said in a\nreport.\n    After trading late yesterday at 5-15/16 pct, Fed funds were\nindicated by brokers to open comfortably at 5-15/16, six pct.\n Reuter\n",

For harvesting to resume as normal, the rains\nwould have to stop long enough for the soil to dry and allow\nfarm machinery to operate.\n    The rains caused flooding in western and northwestern\nBuenos Aires, as more than 750 mm have fallen in some areas\nthere since February 23 while the annual average is 1,200 mm.\n    Flooded areas total between 1.2 and 1.5 mln hectares,\nBuenos Aires province governor Alejandro Armendariz said after\nflying over the flooded area.\n    Agriculture Secretary Ernesto Figueras said only 500,000\nhectares of the area now flooded had been planted, and that\n200,000 to 300,000 hectares could be lost. Growers said large\nparts of the flooded areas were not planted because they are\nlow-lying and flood easily.\n    Trade sources said it was certain crops were damaged by the\nheavy rains but it was too early to tell the exact extent of\nthe damage. They said it was likely rain combined with high\nwinds uprooted many sunflower and maize plants.\n    The sunflower harvest moved forward in the centre and south\nof Cordoba and Santa Fe and got underway in a few isolated\nareas of northern Buenos Aires. Growers have harvested between\n15 and 18 pct of total planted area, up from seven to nine pct\na week ago.\n    Estimates of the total volume of the sunflower crop were\nrevised downward in light of the bad weather.\n    Estimates for total crop ranged from 2.3 to 2.6 mln tonnes,\ndown from 2.4 to 2.7 mln tonnes estimated last week and down\n34.1 to 41.5 pct from last year's record harvest of 4.1 mln\ntonnes.\n    Maize harvesting also advanced, reaching between 13 and 15\npct of total planted area compared to seven to nine pct a week\nago.

But economists said that\nseasonal factors make it hard to assess what spur to the\neconomy, if any, will come from housing in coming months. And\nafter a steady retreat, mortgage rates seem to be near bottom.\n    U.S. housing starts rose 2.6 pct in February to a\nseasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.851 mln units from 1.804\nmln in January. It was the highest pace for starts since April\n1986.\n    The rate at which permits were issued for future building\nclimbed 4.4 pct to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.764\nmln units after dropping 11.52 pct to 1.690 mln in January.\n    \"February's weather is usually more adverse for home\nbuilding. Because of seasonal factors it's difficult to\ndetermine what this means for the economy down the road,\" said\nAllan Leslie of Discount Corp.\n    The housing report is seasonally-weighted to compensate for\nweather-related setbacks. As a result, milder temperatures\ninflate the statistics.\n    Economists said that low mortgage rates also were a spur to\nbuilding last month. But several believe that rates will now\nconsolidate before edging up in late spring/early summer.\n    \"Builders are looking at current mortgage rates and saying\n'Let's do it now',\" said Mark Obrinsky of the U.S. League of\nSavings Institutions in Washington, whose members supply much\nof the financing for home building.\n    But Obrinsky doubts that there is much more downward\npotential for rates because he foresees higher inflation and \nsome overall improvement in the U.S. economy.\n    He expects rates to gain 50 to 100 basis points in early\nsummer from the 9.50 pct fixed rate effective in February. Last\nNovember, fixed rate mortgages were about 10.30 pct.\n    As expected, the strength in housing was concentrated in\nthe single-family sector. The multi-family area -- which\ntypically represents rental units -- remained weak due to high\nvacancy rates and increased capital costs of such units\nfollowing tax law changes effective January 1.\n    Single-family starts rose at a 5.6 pct annual pace to 1.317\nmln units. Multi-family fell 4.1 pct to a 534,000 rate.\n    \"Strength in the single-family sector indicates that low\nmortgage rates are doing their job. But we're probably not\nlooking at a great deal of growth potential,\" said Ward\nMcCarthy of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.\n    McCarthy noted that the housing report, together with\nlarger than expected gains in U.S. employment, industrial\noutput and retail sales in February, may cause some observers\nto start waving \"four pct GNP banners\" for the first quarter.\nGross national product grew 1.3 pct in the fourth quarter.\n    But McCarthy, who still expects first quarter real GNP to\ncome in at an annual rate of 2.5 pct or slightly above, is not\nconvinced that growth will pick up in future.\n    \"The big story is the inventory re-building that's going on\nnow, not all of which is intentional,\" he said. For example,\nU.S. automakers, who are already saddled with high stocks,\nproduced at an annual rate of 8.3 mln units in February\ncompared with domestic car sales of 7.3 mln.\n    Thus while inventories could contribute to GNP in the first\nquarter, they may result in scaled-back production and weaker\ngrowth in the second, he said.\n    \"If most of the first quarter growth is inventory building\nand we cannot identify any improvement in export demand, then\nthere is the potential for softness in the second quarter,\"\nagreed Allan Leslie of Discount Corp. He is still evaluating\nfirst quarter GNP prospects.\n    Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker said last week that\ncurrent data do not show the worsening in trade has reversed.\n    \"At the same time that we are pumping up inventories in the\nfirst quarter, we could foresee production slowing in the\nsecond,\" cautioned Joe Plocek of McCarthy, Crisanti and Maffei\nInc, who expects first quarter growth of about three pct.\n Reuter\n",

Growers fear they may find more empty\npods and have to further reduce their forecasts of total yield.\n    The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 to\n3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct higher than the 1985/86\nrecord of 3.34 mln hectares.\n    The state of the crop continued to be good in general until\nlast week but intense, heavy rains since could have caused\ndamage in areas where rainfall was higher than 100 mm.\n    Where the rains were less heavy they were considered\nbeneficial although too late to improve yield estimates.\n    The rains also benefitted maize and sorghum crops in\nsouthern Buenos Aires province but are not expected to\ninfluence production forecasts.\n    In other areas, especially western Buenos Aires, where\nrainfall was more than 200 mm, parts of the sunflower, maize\nand sorghum crops not yet harvested may have been damaged.\n    The coarse grain crop harvest was interrupted last week by\nrains which also reached over 100 mm in parts of Cordoba, La\nPampa and Santa Fe and almost 90 mm in parts of Entre Rios.\n    The area sown with maize this season was between 3.58 and\n3.78 mln hectares, two to seven pct less than the 3.85 mln\nhectares in 1985/86.\n    The yield of 1986/87 maize continued to be forecast at\nbetween 9.9 and 10.1 mln tonnes.\n    This estimate is 19.8 to 20.2 pct lower than the 12.4 to\n12.6 mln tonnes at which private sources put 1985/86 production\nand 21.1 to 22.7 pct lower than the official 12.8 mln tonnes.\n    The sunflowerseed harvest has covered 23 to 26 pct of the\narea sown and continues in parts of central Buenos Aires\nalthough at a standstill elsewhere due to rain and floods.\n    A resumption of full harvesting and assessment of damage is\nimpossible until rains stop and a spell of a week to 10 days of\nsunshine dries the fields.\n    The area sown this season was 2.0 to 2.2 mln hectares, down\n29.9 to 36.3 pct on last year's record 3.14 mln hectares.\n    Sunflowerseed 1986/87 production is still forecast at 2.3\nto 2.6 mln tonnes, 34.1 to 41.5 pct below the 1985/86 record of\n4.1 mln tonnes.\n    The grain sorghum harvest was the least affected by the\nrains, advancing steadily in Santa Fe and Cordoba and starting\nin La Pampa to cover 14 to 16 pct of the total area sown.\n    The area sown was 1.23 to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3 to 15.2\npct less than the 1.45 mln hectares the previous season.\n    Yield estimates remained at 3.2 to 3.5 mln tonnes, 16.7 to\n22 pct down on 1985/86 production of 4.1 to 4.2 mln tonnes.\n Reuter\n",

Some traders and analysts expect limit declines in\nnearby contracts, with spillover selling likely in cattle.\n    University of Missouri agronomist Glen Grimes said,\"The\nreport shows that hog producers have responded to a very\ndesirable feeding ratio that they enjoyed for the past 10\nmonths.\"\n    Shearson Lehman analyst Chuck Levitt said hog futures\nprices are above producers' break even points. Even if futures\nfell the daily limit of 1.50 cents today, producers could still\nlock in a profit, which increases the likelihood of heavy\nselling pressure today.\n    \"We have not had a period of profitability of this\nmagnitude since last summer,\" Levitt said. \"In fact, hog\noperations on many mixed livestock/grain enterprises have been\nso profitable that it actually enabled some farmers to get back\non their feet and refinance their loans just based on the hog\noperation alone.\"\n    Levitt said the weight breakdown in the report also was\nnegative, in that some lead time was anticipated before the\nslaughter increased from the previous year.\n    We expected farmers to increase hog operations, but we\ndidn't expect this degree of expansion to show up in a 10-state\nspring report, Levitt added.\n    High hog corn ratios (the number of bushels of corn that\ncould be bought for 100 lbs of hog) and the resulting increased\nprofits, encouraged farmers and confinement operations to\nincrease production starting late last year.\n    Analysts also noted that part of the increase in the hog\nherd resulted from a revision of the December report and\nwithout the revision, the March report might have been very\nclose to average expectations.\n    Robin Fuller of Agri Analysis said the USDA made a major\nupward revision of 105,000 head in the size of the breeding\nherd in the December 1 report. So the December report was more\nbearish than initially indicated.\n    But Fuller, as well as other analysts, expected the report\nto be less negative on deferred futures contracts. Distant\ncontracts are already at a sharp discount to cash because\ntraders anticipated high farrowing intentions, she noted.\n    Discounts in the October and December contracts take into\nconsideration a six to seven pct increase in March/May\nfarrowing intentions, which was borne out in the March 1\nreport, Fuller said.\n    Grimes said, \"As far as the distant months are concerned,\nif our first quarter pig crop is up only six pct and under 60\nlb inventories actually up only five pct, it would take a\ntremendous discount in price for each percent increase for us\nto push down to the prices that the current futures show for\nthe July and August period.\"\n    Jerry Abbenhaus, analyst for AGE Clearing noted that\ndistant futures prices are already 15 to 20 dlrs lower than\nthey were last summer.\n    \"If cash hogs at the 7-markets last year averaged 61 dlrs\nduring July, that doesn't mean hogs have to be 15 dlrs cheaper\nthis year because we have six pct more numbers,\" he said.\n Reuter\n",

However, he\nsaid new wage agreements in West Germany had raised inflation\nexpectations which would put upward pressure on interest rates\nin the longer term.\n    In the Netherlands, the inflation outlook for 1987 is nil,\nor even negative, while the latest official economic forecasts\npoint to a falling rate of economic growth.\n    \"It will depend on the outcome of collective wage agreement\nnegotiations here whether there could be cost push inflation,\"\nthe ABN economist said.\n    He said Dutch money supply growth, which ran at 3.4 pct in\nJanuary, could also contribute to some inflation.\n    At Amro Bank, a leading analyst said inflation could run to\ntwo pct next year. The bank expects Dutch capital market rates,\ncurrently averaging around 6.1 pct, to stop easing in the\nsecond half of this year and stabilize around 5.6 pct.\n    Analysts said an official rate cut could trigger a buying\nspree on the bond market which would bring yields down,\nprobably only temporarily, while money rates could fall below\nfive pct.\n    Currently, all periods are traded at 5.12 to 5.25 pct in\nthe money market.\n REUTER\n",

The \ndeclines were a result of the Tax Reform Act of 1986.\n    Federal withheld income taxes were up in February from a\nmonth earlier but that was offset by declines in federal\nnonwithheld taxes and lower state and local income taxes.\n    Disposable personal income in February after taxes was up\n1.2 pct or 37.8 billion dlrs to 3,063.4 billion dlrs after\nrising 25.8 billion dlrs in January.\n    The personal savings rate eased to 3.6 pct in February from\nfour pct in January, the department said.\n Reuter\n",
