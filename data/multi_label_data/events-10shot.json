        "utterance": "Data source: Diplomat Pharmacy.\nWhat happened with Diplomat Pharmacy this quarter?\nMost of the overall increase in revenue came from the PBM companies Diplomat acquired and rolled into CastiaRx. Revenue for the legacy specialty-pharmacy business grew 8% year over year; drug infusions led the way, up 13%.\nGross margin for the specialty segment dropped from 5.8% in the year-ago quarter to 5.5% in the third quarter, but the company is still making almost as much per prescription: $287 per script in the third quarter versus $289 per script in the year-ago quarter.\nDuring the quarter, Diplomat added two more limited-distribution drugs to its exclusive or semi-exclusive offering of more than 120 drugs.\nCastiaRx is profitable, generating $26 million in gross profit in the quarter. But selling, general and administrative expenses, and interest expenses from debt taken on to pay for the acquisitions, resulted in the company only breaking even for the quarter.\nThe integration of the PBMs has generated $7 million in synergies so far this year, putting the company on track to hit its guidance of $8 million to $10 million in synergies in 2018.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nWhat management had to say\nChairman and CEO Brian Griffin\nlaid it out frankly\n: \"With respect to the CastiaRx launch in April, this is really early days relative to our pure PBM performance. It is a rebuilding year for us.\"\nDiplomat is going to lose some Medicare Part D PBM contracts at the start of next year, but those were relatively low-margin contracts set up by the previous owners, as chief financial officer Atul Kavthekar outlined:\nWe expect the loss of this business to negatively impact Diplomat's 2019 revenue by approximately 4%. Our objective is to offset this revenue loss with new relatively higher-margin business, some of which we've already booked. We are still in the midst of the 2019 PBM selling season, and so a full view into the 2019 outlook is not currently available, but will be incorporated in our 2019 guidance.\nLooking forward\nManagement dropped the top end of its 2018 revenue guidance, which previously went up to $5.9 billion; it now expects revenue to fall between $5.5 billion and $5.7 billion. Bottom-line guidance for 2018 was increased to a range of a loss of $0.10 per share to a gain of $0.03 per share, up from the previous range of a loss of $0.15 per share to a gain of $0.01.\nMore important than the 2018 numbers is guidance for 2019, to see whether the rebuilding created a better team. Unfortunately, the smaller companies that Diplomat is wooing for its PBM business don't tend to make decisions until late in the year, so management won't be able to give 2019 guidance until early next year.\nhas no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

        "utterance": "Utah nonprofit drugmaker says it can make 1/3 of Americas insulin and sell it cheap\nLehi-based Civica Rx says its new insulin line could reshape drug pricing nationwide.\n(Rachel Rydalch | The Salt Lake Tribune) Katherine Stewart, from Highland, Utah, holds up an emergency nasal powder called BAQSIMI, that she has to use if her blood sugar goes too low, Tuesday, March 8, 2022.\nBy Erin Alberty\n| March 8, 2022, 10:37 p.m.\nA Utah-based nonprofit drug company plans to introduce generic versions of costly insulin, potentially revolutionizing drug pricing schemes that have long been considered predatory and financially excruciating for diabetics.\nOur goal is to democratize insulin, said Dan Liljenquist, board chair of Civica Rx and chief strategy officer for Intermountain Healthcare. These insulin molecules are well past their patented life, and were intending to produce these insulins so that these formulas, which are owned by society, enter the public domain within reach of regular people.\nCivica Rx will make generic versions of Humalog, Novolog and Lantus at $30 per vial or $55 per five-pack of injectable pens a price reduction of 80% to 90% compared to the brand-name drugs, Lilienquist said.\nPending licensure by the Food and Drug Administration, the insulin will be manufactured at a 3.2-acre factory in Petersburg, Va., where Civica expects to be able to produce 80 million vials and 50 million pens each year about a third of the insulin prescribed in the United States, Liljenquist said.\nThats enough to potentially change how insulin is priced, he said.\nInsulin is so expensive, its something Ive already started to worry about, said Katherine Stewart, 16, of Highland. Stewarts family has spent about $500 a month on insulin since she was diagnosed with diabetes at age 5 and thats for the months after the family has met its insurance deductible. Until then, the cost is closer to $2,000.\nHaving to worry about this seems like growing up too fast, Stewart said in a news conference Tuesday.\nThe familys costs declined after lawmakers\ncapped insulin copays in 2020\n, but those caps only apply to patients with group insurance plans. Meanwhile, many Utahns are rationing insulin, which can be deadly for diabetics, and begging online for leftover doses\nSocial media companies have cracked down on Utahs not-so-secret underground insulin trade, which is technically illegal, so now desperate patients and their families have begun to encode their pleas with spelling errors and alternate wording to evade bots, said Brandi Stewart, Katherines mother.\nMeeting other Utah families coping with insulin costs over the years has shown her that $500 a month is not the worst of it, she said.\nAnother family that had three diabetic children paid $11,000 in one month out of pocket for their three kids insulin because it was the first of the year and their high deductible had not been met yet, Brandi Stewart said. Thats a huge financial burden that a lot of Utahns just cant afford, and it doesnt need to be that way.\nThe lack of transparency in prescription drug prices has made it difficult to know who exactly ends up with all of that money. Insurers point to pharmacy benefit managers middlemen that negotiate with pharmaceutical companies to decide which drugs an insurer will cover.\nWhen a PBM lists a drug for insurance coverage, they get a rebate from the drug company, which the PBMs say they pass along to the insurance company to reduce premiums. But no one knows how much of that rebate gets passed on to the insurer, or whether the insurer actually uses it to reduce premiums and just three PBMs control about 80% of the U.S. market\nIndustry watchdogs have worried that these rebates give PBMs an incentive not to include cheaper drugs on insurance plans, since those capture smaller rebates than expensive drugs do.\nThat pricing mechanism may also explain why generic insulin has been slow to catch on. Months after Eli Lilly introduced a generic version of Humalog in 2019, only 1 in 5 Americans with commercial insurance were on plans that covered it. In a phone survey conducted by U.S. Senate staffers, 83% of the pharmacies they called didnt even have the generic version in stock and 69% said they couldnt even order it.\nAnd two months after Novo Nordisk introduced a generic version of Novolog in 2020, its uptake was even slower, according to GoodRx.com\nBut there are a few reasons Civicas generics may take off, even where for-profit drug companies own generics did not.\nFirst of all, Civica is nonprofit and is not producing generics that will compete with its own, pricier brand-name products, as for-profit companies have. That means it has no incentive to downplay the generic in marketing.\nWhen youre making a more-expensive insulin on the same production line as the less-expensive insulin, whats in your interest to sell? Liljenquist asked.\nSecond, Civica has lined up insurers, including SelectHealth, Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, Kaiser Permanente and Anthem, Inc. as partners.\nWe dont think the pharmacy benefit managers or other people could block this, Liljenquist said.\nThird, even if no insurers were willing to cover Civicas insulin the prices still are a fraction of the out-of-pocket costs for millions of patients who dont live in the 20 or so states that have passed insulin caps, or who are either uninsured or covered by self-funded plans, which arent subject to state copay caps. (A national insulin cap, while popular, has met with challenges in Congress)\nHow are you going to persuade a family to go and shell out thousands of dollars they cant afford for insulin, to stay in-benefit when they can go to an online pharmacy and get Civica insulin at a fair price? Liljenquist said. It will unstick the rebate game for insulin, and thats exactly what we intend to do, so that the patients who are the ones paying the cost of those rebates actually get to pay a fair price upfront.\nCivica expects to complete building its Virginia plant by the end of the year and launch its insulin line in 2024, Liljenquist said.\nWhen theres a market failure like this, that is exploitive, that takes advantage of people who already desperately trying to manage disease, its wrong, he said.",

        "utterance": "160\nVitamin D\nBOSTON HEALTH Vitamin D deficiency strongly exaggerates the craving for and effects of opioids, potentially increasing the risk for dependence and addiction, according to a new study led by researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). These findings, published in Science Advances, suggest that addressing the common problem of vitamin D deficiency with inexpensive supplements could play a part in combating the ongoing scourge of opioid addiction.\nEarlier work by David E. Fisher, MD, PhD, director of the Mass General Cancer Centers Melanoma Program and director of MGHs Cutaneous Biology Research Center (CBRC), laid the foundation for the current study. In 2007, Fisher and his team found something unexpected: Exposure to ultraviolet (UV) rays (specifically the form called UVB), causes the skin to produce the hormone endorphin, which is chemically related to morphine, heroin and other opioidsin fact, all activate the same receptors in the brain. A subsequent study by Fisher found that UV exposure raises endorphin levels in mice, which then display behavior consistent with opioid addiction.\nEndorphin is sometimes called a feel good hormone because it induces a sense of mild euphoria. Studies have suggested that some people develop urges to sunbathe and visit tanning salons that mirror the behaviors of opioid addicts. Fisher and his colleagues speculated that people may seek out UVB because they unknowingly crave the endorphin rush. But that suggests a major contradiction. Why would we evolve to be behaviorally drawn towards the most common carcinogen that exists? asked Fisher. After all, sun exposure is the primary cause of skin cancer, to say nothing of wrinkles and other skin damage.\nFisher believes that the only explanation for why humans and other animals seek out the sun is that exposure to UV radiation is necessary for production of vitamin D, which our bodies cant formulate on their own. Vitamin D promotes uptake of calcium, which is essential for building bone. As tribes of humans migrated north during prehistoric times, an evolutionary alteration might have been needed to compel them to step out of caves and into the sunshine on bitterly cold days. Otherwise, small children would have died of prolonged vitamin D deficiency (the cause of rickets) and weak bones might have shattered when people ran from predators, leaving them vulnerable.\nThis theory led Fisher and colleagues to hypothesize that sun seeking is driven by vitamin D deficiency, with the goal of increasing synthesis of the hormone for survival, and that vitamin D deficiency might also make the body more sensitive to the effects of opioids, potentially contributing to addiction. Our goal in this study was to understand the relationship between vitamin D signaling in the body and UV-seeking and opioid-seeking behaviors, says lead author Lajos V. Kemny, MD, PhD, a postdoctoral research fellow in Dermatology at MGH.\nIn the Science Advances paper, Fisher, Kemny and a multidisciplinary team from several institutions addressed the question from dual perspectives. In one arm of the study, they compared normal laboratory mice with mice that were deficient in vitamin D (either through special breeding or by removing vitamin D from their diets). We found that modulating vitamin D levels changes multiple addictive behaviors to both UV and opioids, says Kemny. Importantly, when the mice were conditioned with modest doses of morphine, those deficient in vitamin D continued seeking out the drug, behavior that was less common among the normal mice. When morphine was withdrawn, the mice with low vitamin D levels were far more likely to develop withdrawal symptoms.\nThe study also found that morphine worked more effectively as a pain reliever in mice with vitamin D deficiencythat is, the opioid had an exaggerated response in these mice, which may be concerning if its true in humans, too, says Fisher. After all, consider a surgery patient who receives morphine for pain control after the operation. If that patient is deficient in vitamin D, the euphoric effects of morphine could be exaggerated, says Fisher, and that person is more likely to become addicted.\nThe lab data suggesting that vitamin D deficiency increases addictive behavior was supported by several accompanying analyses of human health records. One showed that patients with modestly low vitamin D levels were 50 percent more likely than others with normal levels to use opioids, while patients who had severe vitamin D deficiency were 90 percent more likely. Another analysis found that patients diagnosed with opioid use disorder (OUD) were more likely than others to be deficient in vitamin D.\nBack in the lab, one of the studys other critical findings could have significant implications, says Fisher. When we corrected vitamin D levels in the deficient mice, their opioid responses reversed and returned to normal, he says. In humans, vitamin D deficiency is widespread, but is safely and easily treated with low-cost dietary supplements, notes Fisher. While more research is needed, he believes that treating vitamin D deficiency may offer a new way to help reduce the risk for OUD and bolster existing treatments for the disorder. Our results suggests that we may have an opportunity in the public health arena to influence the opioid epidemic, says Fisher.\nTAGS",

Courtesy of COMO Hotels.\nWhen my alarm went off at 7 A.M., following a jet lag-induced sleepless night at Londons Nobu Portman Square hotel, I was not pleased. Unwillingly, I tumbled out of bed, climbed into workout leggings, slid my feet into my slippers and took the elevator down the spa floor. It was a Monday morningmy second day in London after flying in from New Yorkand for some reason I thought it would be a good idea to book a 7:30am Pilates class at the hotels studio; as a Pilates fan, an in-hotel reformer studio sounded like a dream.\nAccessible from the street (for locals) or via elevator (for guests), the wood-clad studio, lined with ten slick black reformers, has a number of morning and evening classes from classic to more energetic power flow. Not only is it a great way to help kick jet lag, but its an opportunity to do some pelvic curls with new instructors, as well as Pilates enthusiasts from the neighborhood.\nThe pilates studio at the Nobu Portman Hotel in London is open to guests and locals alike.\nCourtesy of Nobu Hotels.\nPerhaps fueled by at-home mat workouts or a need for more breath work during a stressful time, Pilates has become increasingly popular. Hotels are catching on, offering everything from basic mat classes under canopies of trees to advanced reformer sessions in polished, kitted-out studios.\nThe decision to put a Pilates studio in was a natural fit, considering it is getting a lot more spotlight as a way to train the body from a 360 perspective, says Marsha Lindsay, the creative director of Nobu Pilates. People are prioritizing correct movement and overall longevity much more [since the pandemic]. And Pilates focuses on training your muscles in a functional way, Not only has she noticed the guests Pilates appreciation post long-haul flight, but how people are increasingly craving breath-focused exercises.\nA pavilion among the treetops at BodyHoliday in St. Lucia is used for both yoga and pilates mat classes.\nCourtesy of BodyHoliday\nA travelers decision to stay at a certain hotel, or even to book a certain destination, can often come down to its fitness offerings: Does the gym have a Peloton bike? Is the pool long enough to do laps? Is there a yoga studio nearby? Pilates is no exception.\nIt comes as no surprise that COMO hotels, a brand known for its wellness programming, would launch group mat and private reformer classes at its Parrot Cay private island property in Turks & Caicos. Lisa Manser, COMO Shambalas group wellness director, has seen an increase in demand for the workout, partly due to the fact that theres a growing variety of methods. Theres a significant rise in Pilates instructors who practice other modalitiesphysiotherapists, massage therapists and Personal trainersthat Pilates can enhance. Better still, the hotel has a 90 minute head-to-toe Pilates alignment session, a curated experience that includes a full body alignment screening and session with an expert, as well as a takeaway body chart with tailored exercises to do at home. (We also recommend a post-pilates dip in the glimmering Caribbean sea.)\nA few islands away, on the balmy island of St. Lucia, BodyHoliday offers group glasses on the hotels Zen Deck, set high up amongst the trees, that all guests can attend as part of the all-inclusive room rate. Pilates allows for guests of all skill-sets to be included, as the exercises can be easily modified, says Andrew Barnard, Managing Director of Sunswept Resorts, which manages the property.\nAt COMO, alignment sessions are offered, complete with a menu of exercises to continue once youre back at home.\nCourtesy of COMO Hotels\nSome places are even teaming up with local experts to help ramp up their programming. Las Ventanas al Paraso, a Rosewood Resort in Los Cabos, began working with Modu Seye, owner of Moduvated, a local health and lifestyle company in 2019. She leads mat and reformer classes as well as different fusion classes including Yogalates, Barre mixed with Pilates and Suspension Pilates. Its an integrative experience that connects mind, body and soul, which travelers today are looking for, says Seye.\nFurther south, Flor Blanca, located along the wild Pacific Coast in Santa Teresa, Costa Rica, also has an oceanfront Pilates studio with every piece of Pilates equipment you can imagine, from springboards to towers, spine correctors and chairs. Its run by a bevy of highly trained instructors offering private and group classes, as well as osteopaths and physiotherapists specializing in therapeutic sessions. This is a Pilates oasis at its best.\nAt CIVANA Wellness Resort & Spa in the Sonoran Desert, the schedule is packed with yoga, meditation and traditional Pilates mat classes. Pilates is seeing a resurgence in popularity, because of its accessibility. Every body type can benefit from and adapt the practice to their particular needs, says Amanda Grant, CIVANAs chief program and partnership officer. With the mat format in particular, it helps that it can be done anywhere.\nBut, like yoga, people arent just incorporating Pilates into their hotel routines, theyre traveling for it too. Shanti-Som in Malaga, Spain, has retreats where travelers can spend between three and ten days doing unlimited spinal twists and teasers. The retreat also includes carefully-planned meals, body scrubs, massages and meditation.\nEven after my rude awakening, my hour-long power class at Nobu Pilates was positively day-changing.

        "utterance": "Send email\nTrilogy Health Services has invested millions into employee education and retention a process that continues as the coronavirus pandemic surges across the country, CEO Leigh Ann Barney told Senior Housing News.\nThe Louisville, Kentucky-based owner and operator is partnering with two colleges to provide continuing education opportunities for its workforce.\nFirst, Trilogy employees and their direct dependents are eligible for scholarships of up to $7,500 to study at the University of Louisville, through an existing partnership between the school and Trilogy Health Services Care Tuition Scholarship program. The scholarship is available to all of the universitys 200 degree programs undergraduate, graduate and professional programs.\nAdvertisement\nIn February, Trilogy and the University of Louisville announced a program offering priority admission to Trilogy employees to attend the colleges nursing program, beginning this fall. The school will work toward accepting up to 25 Trilogy employees per semester, and up to 50 annually. Trilogy Health Services and The Bufford Family Foundation also jointly committed $250,000 towards revitalizing the U of L School of Nursings simulation lab.\nTrilogy is also in the process of formalizing a similar partnership with the Galen College of Nursing Louisville to offer employees priority admission, in the schools Louisville and Cincinnati campuses. These partnerships are intended to give Trilogy employees seeking a career path an opportunity to do so, and in highly competitive nursing programs.\nNursing schools traditionally have limited spots, so they can be difficult to get into. That makes it a little bit more challenging for someone who wants to go from an LPN to an RN, Barney said. If we have designated spots within these nursing programs, then we can put our employees in there and that gives us a leg up.\nAdvertisement\nTrilogy was the 33rd-largest senior living provider in the United States in 2019, according to rankings compiled by industry association Argentum. Overall, the company has a portfolio that includes 110 communities spread across Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio and Michigan. The company is jointly owned by Griffin American Healthcare REIT III and NorthStar Healthcare Income.\nIn this interview, Barney shares details of Trilogys Covid-19 response including how it has segmented its communities to address potential outbreaks; the impact the pandemic is having on its development pipeline; and permanent operational changes stemming from the outbreak including potential involvement in new service lines.\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\nRecommended SHN+ Exclusives\nHow is Trilogy handling markets where there are surges in positive coronavirus cases?\nWe operate in the Midwest, so weve never had the large cases like the Northeast or California or the Southeast. It was a little bit different based on each state and probably had to do with how each state closed and when they closed for business.\nAs communities started to reopen, the biggest thing weve seen recently has been a larger uptick of positives from employees. We attribute that to the vacation season. We had numerous employees taking off and going places. We have a process in place, especially if they go to a hotspot, they have to get tested and have a negative test before they come back to work. We are seeing more positives from those tests. The good thing about this is now that we have testing, we can quarantine those employees and were not seeing the spread as significantly within our facilities. We are catching it from our testing processes that we didnt have access to as readily back in March when things were starting.\nHow are the communities set up to prevent outbreaks, and to isolate residents who test positive?\nWeve split our communities into green units, yellow units and red units. The folks that are in the green units have all been tested and theyre negative for Covid-19. The yellow unit is a transitional unit. This would be where a new admission would come into the facility. Theyll go into the yellow unit for at least two weeks, and theyll be tested. Once we have two negative tests, theyll move off to the green.\nIf someone tests positive, we put them into the red unit and we only have staff that works exclusively on a red unit, so theres no cross contamination between any of the units. They have a separate entryway, PPE is lined up for everybody within that unit. We keep it very contained and very manageable. I think that has helped us.\nThis was something that we developed early on in one of our campuses when we had an outbreak. And we figured that this was the best way to manage it. That also gave us more comfort in our ability to take people from outside the community as admissions, because we know that were not going to mingle them in with everyone else.\nHas Trilogy considered moving staff working in these red units\non-site\n?\nWe havent asked anyone to stay away from their family. Working on the red unit has been voluntary. For the folks that are willing and want to do that, there is extra compensation. Typically the people that do work in that unit, you have the ability to quarantine or maybe it wouldnt be someone who has an underlying health issue.\nWhat other incentives is Trilogy offering its employees?\nOur foundation has historically been known for educational opportunities, as well as employee assistance. We continue to help our employees through that employee assistance program. Weve seen more needs along the lines of child care assistance, as well as helping with food, and we may pay bills. We have seen an increase in the need. Weve also tried to increase our foundation contributions.\nHave there been any changes to Trilogys educational initiatives since the virus spread across the country. Specifically, what is the status of the\nPurdue University Global Initiative\n?\nWe did a pause on new enrollment, but everybody thats in the program is able to continue. We expect that in January well be able to open it back up to new enrollees.\nThe apprenticeship programs that we run, were still promoting, and those all come with pay increases, from the workforce grants that we were able to receive to help fund those programs. Participation in our high school internship programhas also slowed due to the fallout from COVID-19: who could work and who couldnt work; what age they had to be within the facility; as well as parents being concerned about their children. We would love to hire more of these students, but these hurdles have presented a challenge.\nWhat other service lines has Trilogy been able to leverage for operational and cost efficiencies?\nWe already had our own pharmacy and therapy company. That was very helpful. Any time you can control an ancillary service, you get the financial benefits, but also the service that you need in those areas. Going through the pandemic has further reiterated for us with the importance of that, but also having us look at oth",

The average Third member now pays $777.12 per manor per month.\nOccupancy fee\nThird board members agreed to a new rule that will charge a $50 occupancy fee, per manor per month, for each additional occupant beyond two people.\nOfficials said the operating budget is based on two-person households, so additional people need to be accounted for.\nBoth the Golden Rain Foundation and United Mutual already have additional occupancy fees in place, charging $100 and $50 respectively.\nThe additional fee will be used to mitigate expenses related to the additional occupants, such as increased utility rates particularly water and wear-and-tear of common areas, according to a Village Management Services staff report.\nAn estimated 73 condos in Third Mutual house more than two non-lessee occupants. As proposed, the occupancy fee is projected to generate about $43,800 per year.\nOf the 67 live-in care providers in Third Mutual, 26 are third or fourth persons of residence. If applied to those 26, the fee would generate an additional income of $15,600.\nThe total of these two sums estimate an additional annual income of $59,400 for Third.\nDirector Annie McCary said there has been overwhelming feedback from residents, in-person and via email, in favor of the resolution.\nThe board unanimously approved the resolution. It takes immediate effect.\nAlteration fee schedule\nOn second reading, the Third board members tabled a resolution that would have implemented a revised manor alteration fee schedule and raise several fees.\nAlterations are optional modifications to a unit that require Thirds consent, as defined in a staff report.\nAs proposed, the charge a member pays upon variance request was scheduled to increase by $20 jumping from $50 to $70.\nFurthermore, the Basic Variance fee would have been set at $380, the Complex Variance fee at $662, the Unauthorized Alteration fee at $350, and the Resale Inspection fee would have increased from $115 to $220.\nDirector Jim Cook said many of the fees are antiquated. He said the schedule may have once served a purpose to regulate alterations within the Village before Laguna Woods became a city but in the 23 years since incorporation, inspectors are no longer sparse.\nWe are duplicating services that are done by the city, he said. Most of [the alteration fees] should be eliminated.\nHe added that many of the variances listed should be recategorized as mutual consents. Im going to vote no on this until we revise what we require variances for.\nThird member Judith McCourt, who said she once served as a deputy director for a large Orange County organization and still works full-time as president of a corporation, coined Thirds schedule a double-fee system that up charges four to five times city rates.\nFor example, a standard variance fee to install a new central HVAC in Third costs $662. This would be paid in addition to the city cost of $141.\nStaff had projected $83,000 in additional revenue from the proposed alterations fee schedule.\nResident Lisa Mills, a former city council member and former CEO of Orange County Transportation Authority, pointed to the lengthy process of variance approval.\nThis system is very broken, Mills said, listing the various stops, double fees and number of months a resident must wait.\nOn the outside, Mills paid one fee and made one stop at city hall, she said. Residents here who are older, maybe more frail are asked to go through a very tough process.\nBoard members sent the fee schedule back to the committee level for discussion.\nCOVID-19 update\nThe adjusted daily case rate in Orange County has continued to fall, on Tuesday reported at 3.7 new cases per 100,000 residents, according to the OC Health Care Agency.\nThe testing positivity rate the number of swabs and spit tests that return positive the coronavirus stands at 1.9%.\nThe health equity rate the test positivity of disproportionately impacted neighborhoods follows at 2.3%.\nIn the city of Laguna Woods, public health officials reported 1,057 COVID-19 cases as of Tuesday. Laguna Woods has now had 75 coronavirus-related fatalities reported.\nResale report\nThe average resale price for a unit in Third Mutual in February was $507,520, up from $396,818 in February 2021, according to a VMS staff report. Resales year to date numbered 76, up from 71 the year prior. Sales volume in February was $12.7 million compared with $12 million in February 2021.",

        "utterance": "Print\nElizabeth Hertel\nGov. Gretchen Whitmer's administration wants to consolidate multiple contracts for managed care of dental services for Medicaid recipients into one contract, potentially shaking up the delivery of oral health care for the state's poorest residents.\nThe proposed 2023 budget blueprint Whitmer submitted Wednesday to the Legislature calls for a single contract for three different types of benefits: Medicaid-funded dental services through the Healthy Kids Dental program, the dental benefit of the Healthy Michigan Plan for low-income adults and traditional fee-for-service dental care for adults.\nWhitmer's budget proposal for the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services also calls for raising the fee-for-service reimbursement rates for providers by $247.6 million annual to get more dentists to accept the lowest-paying Medicaid patients.\nMDHHS Director Elizabeth Hertel said her department wants a single procurement for managed care of dental services, but that doesn't mean it will be awarded to a single company.\n\"Having a single contract allows for easier management of the beneficiaries and being able to have a network that's adequate across the state,\" Hertel told Crain's.\nThe nearly more than 980,000 low-income adults enrolled in the state's Medicaid program, Healthy Michigan Plan, who get dental benefits through HMP's managed care insurers, such as Health Alliance Plan of Michigan, McLaren Health Plan and Priority Health.\nThose health insurers typically subcontract management of Healthy Michigan's dental benefits to Delta Dental, DentaQuest, DenteMax or another PPO, said Dominick Pallone, executive director of the Michigan Association of Health Plans.\nMAHP supports raising reimbursement rates for dentists, but has \"concerns\" about breaking off a portion of its members' managed care contracts in the Healthy Michigan Plan, Pallone said.\nDominick Pallone\n\"For the Healthy Michigan Plan, we've got that built into our rates,\" Pallone said. \"... If you're going to pull a member's dental benefit out of an integrated benefit and assign it to a different managed care entity, I don't know how you could assume savings.\"\nThe Whitmer administration's proposed increase in fee-for-service provider rates for dentists would cost the state's general fund $69.8 million, while drawing down $177.8 million in matching federal funds, according to the State Budget Office.\nHertel declined to say how much MDHHS spends annually for dental services through all of its Medicaid programs.\n\"We don't generally share what dollar number we're looking at prior to doing a procurement,\" Hertel told Crain's. \"We like to see what people come in at instead of giving them a target.\"\nBy consolidating all Medicaid dental services under one contract, Hertel said, it could eliminate gaps in provider networks.\nCurrently, children in the Healthy Kids Dental program may get service from one dentist who doesn't accept their mother in the traditional Medicaid fee-for-service program or the Healthy Michigan managed care program, Hertel said.\n\"Which is why it's important in this proposal (that) not only are we pulling these together into one managed care contract, but we're also looking to increase the reimbursement rates for dental,\" Hertel said.\n\"The goal here really is to increase access to dental services,\" Hertel said. \"Do I think it will save money? I think in the long run it could save money (by ensuring) adults who currently aren't receiving dental care receive the dental care that they need to avoid more acute or serious issues.\"\nThe contract consolidation move comes four years after the state health department broke up the Healthy Kids Dental contract that Delta Dental of Michigan Inc. had held since its inception in 2000.\nSince 2018, Delta Dental has shared the contract with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, which has used Boston-based DentaQuest as a subcontractor to perform most of the work managing dental benefits for low-income children.\nThat contract survived a court challenge by a third dental benefits managed care firm, Fort Lauderdale-based MCNA Insurance Co. Inc., which alleged Blue Cross acted as a \"shell vendor\" to win a share of the Medicaid business for children's dental care.\nDelta Dental's Healthy Kids Dental contract is valued at $912 million for the fiscal year that ends Sept. 30; Blue Cross' contract is valued at $612.7 million, according to the contracts.\nOkemos-based Delta Dental currently serves 795,000 children in the Healthy Kids Dental program and 191,000 adults through four health plans under the Healthy Michigan Plan, said Rick Lantz, vice president and chief lobbyist for Dental Dental.\nDelta Dental supports the health department's proposed consolidation of all Medicaid dental benefits under one procurement because the current system is bifurcated, leading to different oral health outcomes for the same population of low-income adults, Lantz said.\n\"This has the potential to dramatically improve access to care for Michigan's low-income adults. Delta Dental's position is that it's vital that we make this investment as dental disease left untreated can cause severe pain, infection and diminished overall health.\"\nAdults enrolled in Medicaid health insurance programs often struggle to access dental care, Lantz said.\n\"And because of this, they often show up in hospital emergency departments because their dental pain or infection is so severe that they can't tolerate it anymore,\" Lantz said. \"... We believe it's time to apply the successes of Healthy Kids Dental to that adult program to ensure that our state's most vulnerable adults can receive the dental care that they need.\"\nA representative for Blue Cross did not respond to questions seeking comment about the proposed Medicaid dental contract changes.\nThere are 1.1 million children in the Healthy Kids Dental program, according to MDHHS.\nIf the proposal is approved by the Legislature, MDHHS would put out a request for proposals for a new Medicaid dental managed care contract after the 2023 fiscal year begins on Oct. 1, Hertel said.\nHertel didn't rule out having multiple health plans manage a single contract for Medicaid dental services.\n\"It could be, but we haven't begun establishing anything about the procurement yet and what we're actually looking for and what we're asking people to meet,\" Hertel said. \"But the important thing is it's pulling all of these populations into one contract, one procurement process instead of having separate ones.\"\nEditor's note: This Feb. 10 article was updated on Feb. 14 to include comment from Delta Dental of Michigan.",

We stand ready to work out the details with the mayor, as we have been throughout this process, the group's chair Harry Nespolli said.\nThe city's largest police union, which has sued the city over the mandate, said its officers dont deserve to be treated like second-class citizens.\nWe have been suing the city for months over its arbitrary and capricious vaccine mandate this is exactly what we are talking about. If the mandate isnt necessary for famous people, then its not necessary for the cops who are protecting our city in the middle of a crime crisis, said said its president, Pat Lynch.\nThe city last month fired more than 1,400 workerswho failed to comply with the vaccine mandate. The uneven application could likely invite more legal challenges over the mandate.\nAdams predecessor, Mayor Bill de Blasio, made vaccination mandatory as a workplace safety rule last year, before leaving office.\nJay Varma, a health advisor to de Blasio, said in a tweet that the mandate had legal standing because it applied to everyone.\n#VaccinesWork unless youre rich and powerful, in which case, #LobbyingWorks, Varma wrote. He added: The #KyrieCarveOut opens City up to entire scheme being voided by courts as arbitrary and capricious.\nAdams had said he felt the vaccine rule was unfair when it came to athletes and performers because a loophole in the measure, imposed under his predecessor, allowed visiting players and performers who dont work in New York to still play or perform even if they are unvaccinated.\nIrving, a vaccine holdout, had been among the most high-profile people impacted. He was able to re-join the team in Januarybut only when they played out of town games. When New York lifted rules several weeks ago requiring a vaccine to dine in a restaurant, work out at a gym or attend a performance, Iving was allowed to watch the Nets' home games but not play or enter the locker room.\nThe Nets need him as they push for a playoff spot with nine games left in their regular season.\nConcerns had been raised this that the rule would also impact Major League Baseball.\nYankees star Aaron Judge refused to directly answer a question about his vaccine statusearlier this month, leading to speculation that another New York team would be hobbled by a player's refusal to get inoculated.\nWhen asked Wednesday about the rule being lifted, Judge said he was happy Kyrie can play some home games.\nThe Yankees, who open their season at home against the Boston Red Sox on April 7, said earlier this month that the team president was working with city hall and all other appropriate officials on this matter. The Yankees declined comment Wednesday.\nNew York Mets owner Steve Cohen gave $1.5 million to a political action committee supporting Adams during his 2021 campaign. Adams is a Mets fan.\nAdams has been rolling back vaccine mandates and other coronavirus restrictions, including on Tuesday when he said masks could become optionalfor children under 5 starting April 4.\nMask mandates for older children have already been removed, as well as rules requiring people to show proof of vaccinationto dine in a restaurant, work out at a gym, attend a show, or go to an indoor sporting event.\nCopyright 2022 The Associated Press.

        "utterance": "Share\nOpen Streets events, in which roadways are opened up for recreation and programming, have been successful in U.S. cities like New York, Los Angeles, and Portland. But Chicagos Open Streets Program, which was staged and funded by the Active Transportation Alliance, fizzled out in 2014due to lack of financial and organizational support from the city government.\nHowever, one of the most successful of the Chicago Open Streets events was a single event on State Street in 2011 which ATA put on in partnership with the Chicago Loop Alliance, a member-based organization promoting businesses and cultural activities in the Loop. The happening drew hundreds, maybe thousands, of people to bike, scoot, skateboard, do aerobics, play play with giant blocks, compete in four square, and lounge on Astroturfed parklets on the car-free thoroughfare.\nSkateboarding at Open Streets on State Street in 2011. Photo: John Greenfield\nNow the Loop Alliance is hoping to create a similarly vibrant scene by hosting up to a dozen Open Streets events on State this year. And their program promises to be a shot in the arm for a downtown that is still struggling with the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAcross the country the coronavirus has transformed bustling city centers into ghost towns, and Chicago is no exception. High-rise office buildings once packed with white collar workers now stand mostly empty and, as businesses and employees increasingly settle into remote work, the question of what downtowns like the Loop will look like post-pandemic looms large.\nLast week, the Loop Alliance discussed its Open Streets strategy at a refreshingly optimistic annual meeting that envisioned a downtown in which office work makes a moderate recovery and cultural life flourishes.\nThe keynote speaker for the online event was Diane Wehrle, a founder of Springboard, the U.K.-based company that provides data from 16 pedestrian counters situated along State Street from Wacker to Ida B. Wells Drive for monthly recovery reportsCLA has been generating since last July. Wehrle presented data from the State Street counters, comparing them to cities across the U.S. and the U.K.\nThe charts reflected what you see any day in the Loop since March 2020: a precipitous drop in activity that has yet to recover. However, Wehrle was upbeat about people returning downtown for business and recreation based on trends in the U.K., which is currently ahead of the U.S. in vaccinations. Every week were seeing increases in pedestrian traffic. People are desperate to get out there. Well undoubtably see a resurgence.\nA resurgence, yes, but a likely partial one, at least in terms of in-person office work. Were anticipating a more hybrid model, Wehrle said. At the same time, that absence of collaboration is very stark. I think were all quite Zoomed-out and we want to see people. As people come back in this hybrid model, it may change [commute] patterns throughout the day. They may come in later or stay out longer to make more of their trips when they come in the city.\nJean de St. Aubin, CLA Board Chair (and executive director of the Gene Siskel Film Center) presented plans for 2021 that centered around cultural activities to entice people downtown for reasons other than work: pop-up art galleries in vacant retail spaces, Broadway in Chicago musical performances on the Riverwalk, and notably, the conversion of State Street into a pedestrianized Open Street on Sundays throughout the summer.\nAfter the meeting I spoke with Kalindi Parikh, Director of Planning at the Loop Alliance. Most of the details for Sundays on State are to be determined, but Parikh said the general plan is open State from Lake Street to Madison (allowing east-west vehicular traffic to cross the route) for up to 12 Sundays from July to September, transforming the iconic thoroughfare into a public plaza hosting pop-up performances, free fitness classes and other wellness activities, as well as expanded outdoor dining and retail space.\nA free fitness class at Open Streets on State Street in 2011. Photo: John Greenfield\nParikh couldnt say if the program would continue after pandemic restrictions are lifted, indicated that if the program is deemed successful, that may be a possibility. CLA has done a lot of thinking about the future of our streets, she said. Weekends are so different than weekdays in the Loop. This strikes me as an opportunity to give them a better version of that. Im curious what we learn from this iteration.\nI asked Parikh if the Loop Alliance had any updates on reopening the Chicago Pedway Systemwhich, with the exception of the bottom level of Block 37, a corridor connecting the CTA Red and Blue lines Washington stations, has remained closed during pandemic restrictions. She said the reopening date will likely be sometime this spring or summer, but its not clear exactly when, largely because some sections of the Pedway are owned by the city and some by private buildings. Its hard to do things because there are so many players. Were trying to coordinate this now.\nParikh did say that the Loop Alliance supports allowing dockless electric rental scooters to be parked in the Loop this year, in contrast to the 2020 pilot While the city and the Active Transportation Alliance have voiced concerns about scooters being carelessly parked and ridden on downtown sidewalks, CLA views the  current reduced car traffic volumes as an chance to introduce another downtown commuting mode.\nThere were fears about traffic, but streets have quieted down, Parikh said. If we [introduce the scooters] early people will learn to share those spaces and learn to use them better, so we can be a more multi-modal downtown. Also considering some people are afraid to ride CTA downtown, it can be a good option to commute or commute the last mile.\nDuring the annual meeting presentation, Loop Alliance CEO Michael Edwards mentioned efforts to connect people experiencing homelessness with services, including a pop-up resource center at the Harold Washington Library and the installation of portable toilets throughout the Loop. I asked Parikh if these amenities, beneficial in non-pandemic times, might also become permanent. Personally, I hope they do, she said. Elevate State, a large visioning process CLA leads for State Street, has been paused. Were hoping to resume later this year, and topics like this are top of mind. It plays into the everyones neighborhood campaign as well. Making sure everyone can navigate the Loop and be able to use a restroom.",

The order came after Animal Wellness Action and other wildlife groups filed a lawsuit to stop the hunt.\nCollins said his group has been following Facebook posts about killing wolves since the Trump administration delisted the wolf from the federal endangered species list in January. He pointed to the Wisconsin Wolf Hunting Facebook page, which include comments like smoke a pack a day.\nOther comments referred to the legal battles as games, and said the wolf population cant go unchecked and unmanaged.\nCollins acknowledged most people posting to the page are blowing smoke.\nEven if 0.1% of those turn out to be real, we think were doing our due diligence by putting the offer out there to get the information to the proper authorities, said Collins.\nState law in Wisconsin requires the state Department of Natural Resources to hold a wolf hunt from November through the end of February when the animal isnt under federal protections.\nAdam Jarchow pushed for the wolfs delisting and advocated for state wolf management as a former Republican state lawmaker. Jarchow, who is running for Wisconsin attorney general, said the comments illustrate peoples frustration with the growing number of wolves in Wisconsin and lack of a season.\nI suspect those people that are saying things are just saying it out of frustration, said Jarchow. Obviously, nobody should be breaking the law or killing wolves illegally. But it does illustrate the importance of having a regulated hunt so that we can control this predator.\nJarchow was among a group of Republican lawmakers from northern Wisconsin that proposed a bill that would block game wardens and police from investigating illegal wolf killings in the state in 2017.\nDNR spokesperson Sarah Hoye said the agency hasnt encountered any trend of illegal killings this fall.\nMeanwhile, we read and monitor all comments on the departments social media. We send any comment that mentions poaching to law enforcement for investigation, wrote Hoye in an email. Additionally, if someone mentions that they know of someone who is poaching, we encourage them to report the information they have via our violation hotline.\nThree wolves have been shot in the act of depredating a domestic animal this year, according to DNR officials. The wolves were shot in Price County in August and September. Since the wolfs delisting, landowners are allowed to shoot wolves in the act of biting, wounding or attacking their animals. Shootings must be reported to the DNR within 24 hours.\nAgency officials have said they havent had any recent reports of illegally killed wolves.\nIn February, state-licensed hunters killed 218 wolves in less than 72 hours, taking nearly double the wolves allowed under a 200-wolf quota.\nThe DNRs report on the February harvest found four wolves were illegally taken during the hunt, which were presented at registration. The agency detected 16 illegal killings of wolves from April 2019 to April 2020.\nResearch has shown that illegal kills account for around 9% of deaths each year. One study by University of Wisconsin-Madison researchers, found that around 100 wolves were killed on top of the 218 wolves that were harvested during the February wolf hunt.\nThe DNR encourages people to report any suspected violations to its violation hotline: 1-800-TIP-WDNR.",

        "utterance": "Telegram\nWashington: A recent study conducted by researchers at the University of Bonn suggests that the activity of individual nerve cells in the brain tells us how confident we are in our decisions.\nThe result is unexpected the researchers were actually on the trail of a completely different evaluation mechanism. The results are published in the journal Current Biology.\nEvery day humans have to make decisions. Researchers at the University Hospital Bonn have now identified nerve cells in the brain whose activity indicates the confidence in decisions.\nA total of twelve men and women took part in their experiment.\nWe showed them photos of two different snacks, for example a chocolate bar and a bag of chips. They were then asked to use a slider to indicate which of these alternatives they would rather eat, said Prof. Dr. Dr. Florian Mormann from the Department of Epileptology.\nThe more they moved the slider from its center position towards the left or right photo, the more confident they were in their decision.\nParticipants had to judge a total of 190 different snack pairs in this way. At the same time, the scientists recorded the activity of 830 nerve cells each in the so-called temporal lobe.\nWe discovered that the frequency of the electrical pulses in some neurons, in other words their firing rate, changed with increasing decision confidence, said Mormanns colleague Alexander Unruh-Pinheiro.\nFor instance, some fired more frequently, the more confident the respective test person was in their decision, added Pinheiro.\nIt is the first time that such a correlation between activity and decision confidence has been identified.\nThe affected neurons are located in a brain region that plays a role in memory processes.\nIt is possible that we not only store what decision we made, but also how confident we were in it. Perhaps such a learning process saves us from future wrong decisions, said Mormann.\nEthical reasons usually prohibit the study of the state of individual neurons in living humans. However, the participants in the study suffered from a severe form of epilepsy.\nIn this form of the disease, the characteristic seizures always start in the same area of the brain. One possible treatment is therefore to remove this epileptic focus surgically.\nTo pinpoint the exact location of the defective site, the doctors at the Clinic for Epileptology implant several electrodes in the patient. These are distributed over the entire potentially affected area.\nAt the same time, they also allow an insight into the functioning of individual nerve cells in the brain.\nResearchers at the University of Bonn were originally looking for a completely different phenomenon: When we make a decision, we assign a subjective value to each of the alternatives.\nThere is evidence that this subjective value is also reflected in the activity of individual neurons. The fact that we instead came across this connection between fire behavior and decision confidence surprised even us, said Mormann.\nTags",

It also brings additional concerns:\nEnvironment E-waste contains a long list of chemicals that are harmful to people and the environment.\nResources E-waste contains precious metals like gold and platinum, as well as elements like cobalt and neodymium. There is a finite supply of these resources and its dwindling rapidly.\nHuman rights E-waste is often illegally exported to countries that dont have applicable laws. Once stripped of valuable materials, the remainder is left to pollute the land, air and water of local citizens.\nData security Computing equipment makes up a large portion of the total e-waste produced. The data storage devices inside often contain sensitive information that can have significant detrimental effects when in the wrong hands.\nWhy do special interest groups, industry and governments care about e-waste?\nFor special interest groups, issues pertaining directly to them are always top-of-mind. Their activism serves as the catalyst for governments to take legislative action. Since organizations have a vested interest in the resulting laws, they prepare in advance for complying with the new regulations. The challenge then becomes convincing private citizens to comply with these laws and best practices.\nWhy should individuals care about e-waste?\nAs the world continues to get smaller, a regional issue can quickly develop into a global issue with far-reaching effects. This is especially true with e-waste:\nEnvironmental issues are more acutely felt as larger areas encounter tainted air, water and food.\nRare resources will only become scarcer and costlier to acquire.\nHuman rights violations will continue. Thankfully, the global economy provides new opportunities to enforce international law.\nData security is a major concern as we become more connected. Certified data destruction soon will be a necessity, but are there enough providers to do the job?\nWhat can I do to reduce e-waste?\nThe three keys to addressing e-waste are education, influence and action. Look for opportunities to make\nan impact at a grassroots level:\n1. Education Share your knowledge with others.\n2. Influence Model behavior that is conducive to solving e-waste problems.\n3. Action Take simple actions that make a huge difference.\nBuy only EPEAT registered products.\nBoycott companies that turn a blind eye to human rights violations.\nVote for lawmakers who embrace e-waste management.\nHelp develop e-waste policies in your organization.\nPatronize your local e-recycling company.\nThe question isnt if e-waste reduction and management will happen, its when. As our world becomes more polluted, natural resources dwindle, more people suffer social injustice and lives are ruined by data breaches, change will become a necessity.\nIf youre ready to make a difference in your world, check out SEDDs website and blog for ways you can help solve e-waste issues in your family, organization and community.\nAbout the Author\nChief Technology Officer and\nDirector of E-recycling, Sadoff E-Recycling & Data Destruction Co.\nChad Hayes is the chief technology officer and director of e-recycling at Sadoff E-Recycling & Data Destruction.

Greg's Towing is the only tow company in the Town of Riverdale Park in Prince Georges County and, for 30 years, it was the exclusive tow service provider for the town and its police department. Once Mr. Ashkar took over Greg's Towing, he contacted Town representatives, including the police dept., to continue the company's long standing relationship with the Town, but he was denied the by the Town, its employees and the police department through numerous instances that included derogatory language, name-calling and discriminatory statements.\nLocal government cannot discriminate against its citizens and this case is about fairness, justice and equality and this verdict speaks to that, Levi S.

(credit: REUTERS/ALESSANDRO BIANCHI)\nMekorots technologies improve the quality of water production and its consumption, and provide a myriad of benefits to the Israeli economy, while reducing the cost of living. They could also greatly improve the energy consumption, big data and cybersecurity sectors across the world, among other examples.\nFocusing on fiber optics, the water company developed a way to fish fiber optic lines throughout the country using its already existing pipeline infrastructure that stretches from the far reaches of the North back down to the southern borders. One of the recent projects that were dispatched was to connect the Negevs capital  the city of Beersheba  to Eilat, through a 280-km. pipeline.\nWe got the idea from the army, Mekorot chief technology officer Moti Shiri explained. The fiber optics are used by the army along the road to listen to noise stemming from long distances. Whether it be a car, people or animals, the technology can pick up and pinpoint the sounds from far away.\nWe didnt start this project for communication capabilities, our goal was to change the pipe to a smart pipe, Shiri said. We wanted to know in every centimeter or every inch of pipe what is happening in real time.\nThe fiber optics discovery ended up being just a plus to the equation, a plus that could save the Israeli economy and its citizens billions a year and countless hours of work in the process.\nThis makes it a prominent option to provide high-speed internet to the entirety of the country  especially sections that would otherwise not have access  at a lower cost than it would have originally been if the fiber optics cables were to be disseminated using non-existing infrastructure  infrastructure that would either have had to be commissioned or constructed from scratch.\nOur goal now is to connect the entirety of Israel to fiber optics, Shiri said. Not all of Israel is connected to fiber optics, and to connect them across the entire country costs a lot of money and takes a lot of time.\nShiri said that considering Mekorot has pipes all across the country  even in the remote sections  that by using the pipes, communications companies can connect to these remote areas quickly, instead of waiting three to four years to do it.\nIf the infrastructure would have had to have been built from scratch, it could cost the Israeli economy billions in construction, deployment, digging, permits and creating the overall infrastructure companies would need to house the fiber optic lines within. Additionally, as a separate plus, Mekorot forwards the option to use indoor facilities for the construction of a data center and Hub.\nMekorot itself, is the owner of more than 13,000 km. of existing and protected underground infrastructure throughout Israel, which constitutes as essential valuable real estate for a fiber network deployment  real estate which will all eventually be filled with fiber optic capabilities.\nTo disseminate the lines throughout the country, Mekorot fashioned a way to insert fiber optics cables into the pipelines and dispatch them throughout the country  2 km. at a time  using an innovative system that uses both water and air pressure to carry and transp",

We have carefully selected communities that are searching for a professional, best-in-class organization.\nThe new Skymint stores will feature high quality medical marijuana and marijuana products in a contemporary and inviting setting. The first locations of the 19 Michigan stores will be announced after the licenses are issued by the State of Michigan LARA Bureau of Medical Marihuana Regulation Board. The first store is expected to open in March 2019.\nWe have hired talented people from inside and outside the cannabis industry to produce, process and safeguard our Skymint harvest, said Molly VanSyckle, director of human resources. We have over 50 team members now and will grow to be more than 270 by the end of 2019.\nIn July 2018, Green Peak Innovations received pre-qualification by the LARA Bureau of Medical Marihuana Regulation for a full vertical suite of medical marijuana licenses including 12 class C cultivation licenses, one processor license and 19 provisioning center licenses. GPI was awarded two Class C cultivation licenses in October, ten additional Class C cultivation licenses in December, and anticipates receiving the remainder of the licenses over the next few months.\nThis month, our 60,000 square foot Windsor Township headquarters in Harvest Park will become fully operational and our first crop will be harvested, added Radway.

Dhanik joined the team before MySpace became a huge thing, and, from 2003 to 2008, he was the VP of strategic marketing. In 2009, he founded engage: BDR, a marketing company. And that helped him get to a net worth of $5 million as of 2022, and afford among many others a Bugatti Veyron.\nThe former MySpace executive shared a shot of my bug on his social media. He worked on the hypercar and on several other projects with RDB LA.\nIn 2005, Bugatti introduced the Veyronline, which lasted until 2011. It was the first production car that offered more than 1,000 horsepower. One can imagine, its price was up to measure. It was both exotic and powerful and came with the title of the fastest production car at the time. But, even today, you could find its name among the worlds fastest (the Veyron Super Sport version).\nThe German-then-French carmaker gave it an 8.0-liter W16 engine, mated to a 7-speed automatic double-clutch transmission. 987 horsepower (1,001 ps) and a maximum torque of 922 lb-ft (1,250 Nm) go to both axles. The Veyron is able to sprint to 62 (100 kph) from a standstill in 3.2 seconds and hits a top speed of 253 mph (407 kph).\nPainted in black and red on the outside, according to an older video from RDB LA the Veyron sports the same color scheme on board.\nAccording to Vik from RDB LA, Dhanik had purchased the Bugatti a few months ago, at the moment of their video, in March 2021. But, in a past interview with CelebMagazine he revealed he would only keep the car for a couple of years and then level up. So, who knows for how long he'll enjoy this dazzling ladybug?",

        "utterance": "Tips and Tricks\nThere is no such thing as a best dental service, and people should be skeptical when someone claims that they offer the best services. There are so many great dental services available online, but not all are reliable. You can get in touch with the official websites of these online dental services and check out what they have to offer.\nHowever, in-person consultation and examination by a licensed dentist are advisable before committing to a dental service provider according to ones needs. Only a good doctor will be able to help you through dental emergencies. Heres what to look for before committing to any online dental service.\nTable of Contents\nThe Reviews Of The Dentist\nReputation Of The Dental Service\nDo you want your teeth to be worked upon by a service provider with a bad reputation? Reputation matters. Thousands of people commit to dental services without checking the reviews online because they hurry. A quick web search will bring up numerous user reviews. Always consider these before committing.\nThe Actual Charges For The Services\nWhat is it that you need the most? The general practice, cosmetic dentistry, and special needs can be priced differently. Various services are available online with different prices per ones needs. It is advisable to check on these fees and make an informed decision before settling for any company.\nTotal Time Taken For Treatment\nDental procedures can last for a few hours and days, depending on the requirements for your teeth work, among other factors. Some dental service providers with less experience may take longer than expected. However, you do not have to spend most of your time on these treatments. With experts like\nFort Washington Dental Associates\nby your side, you can get better treatments in a short time.\nThe Quality Of Care\nBased on the reviews, it is essential to know what kind of dental services one can expect from the dental service provider. Reading about the success stories and testimonials is an excellent way to understand what others say about your chosen rental service provider. Good medical expertise is also supplied with an equal level of care from the medical staff for better results.\nThe Reviews Of The Dentist\nIt is essential to know who will be handling your teeth and what kind of training they have gone through. The best way to choose\nprofessional dentists\nis to read the reviews online and get in touch with them according to your requirements. Genuine reviews can be reliable to know more about the quality of service offered by your dentist. In addition, you can read about the firsthand experiences of users of these services and make a better decision in the best possible interest for you.\nNo one should ever be tricked into thinking that they can just get all their dental work with any random dentist. You need to have the correct information and feel comfortable with your chosen dentist, or else you will end up wasting your money on a service that is of little help to you.\nPrevious Post\nWhy You May Need a Hearing Test, and What to Expect from this?\nLeave a Reply",

        "utterance": "The Big Idea\nWHEN HEALTH TECH GETS TOO PERSONAL:\nIf youre one of tens of millions of people tracking calories, alcohol, moods or even ovulation cycles on a smartphone app, beware: Theres little in the law to stop those app makers from sharing personal data with marketers  even about pregnancy.\nA recent crackdown on popular menstrual cycle trackers revealed the patchwork state of patient privacy protections and the limited tools at regulators disposal. A proposed Federal Trade Commission settlement with makers of the Flo app  over allegedly divulging user data including pregnancy status with Facebook and Google despite assurances that it wouldnt share data  sparked a broader debate among FTC commissioners about their authority to police unscrupulous data sharing. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, who is President Joe Bidens pick to lead HHS, last fall fined the makers of a competing fertility app Glow $250,000 for failing to adequately protect data. But consumers wont see a dime from that settlement.\nThese types of apps arent typically broadcasting your health status to other users. But they are routinely handing marketing companies de-identified data for targeted promotions, which experts warn could easily be re-identified or lead to invasive ads.\nAP\nWeak protections:\nAll of the health and fitness wearables were using, all of the apps were using  there are very few protections, if any, for them,\" said Emory Roane, policy counsel for the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse.\nConsumers by and large have few options for recourse if they suspect an app isnt protecting their health data, legal experts tell Future Pulse. The FTC and state attorneys general can open investigations into shady practices, but consumers themselves typically cannot sue for privacy violations, FTC Commissioner Noah Phillips said. His agencys proposed settlement with Flo doesnt include financial penalties, as it can only levy fines if a company violates the settlement terms.\nRoane said the Flo case underscores the weakness of the nations health data protections. Its a mess, he said, referring to the privacy protections for health apps that go straight to consumers.\nA vast data ecosystem:\nWebsites and apps routinely share consumers personal data with advertising giants Google and Facebook or other data brokers, often linking it to a users IP address or, in the case of Flo, an Advertising ID. The massive advertising ecosystem uses those consumer profiles to deliver targeted ads based on a persons perceived interests and life circumstances -- for instance, maternity clothes or a new stroller for a person who an algorithm identifies as pregnant. Often these practices are buried in a companys privacy policy and cloaked in dense legalese.\nBut while consumers have become increasingly aware of how companies are leveraging this data, they may falsely believe theyre protected by stringent health care laws governing medical information held by doctors, hospitals and their business associates. But those laws dont apply to data collected by most consumer apps.\nFederal and state health data privacy laws restrict data sharing when its gathered by hospitals and insurers. But consumer apps, as long as theyre not working with companies in the health sector, can gather the same kind of data and produce an equally, or more sensitive profile about you and your health information, said Marc Groman, a senior privacy adviser to former President Barack Obama and the FTCs first chief privacy officer.\nAnd thats not covered by any of those laws, full stop, he said.\nAP Photo\nA changing landscape:\nThe explosion of Covid-related apps  from vaccination passports to contact tracing  is shaping up to be the most likely target for health-data privacy regulation in Washington. Lawmakers have introduced at least three proposals since the start of the pandemic to give consumers greater control over their personal information and guard against breaches  protections that could factor into negotiations over future Covid relief packages.\nBut for anything to pass, Congress would need to resolve familiar sticking points. That includes whether consumers can sue over violations, an approach favored by privacy advocates and many Democrats, and whether a federal law should override state privacy rules. Republicans and industry groups have pushed for the latter, but that idea has met resistance from Democrats, particularly the Houses powerful California delegation.\nPrivacy legislation is a heavy lift even in California, which has the strongest data-privacy law in the nation.\nTwo privacy bills on contact-tracing data died in the state Senatelast year, and Gov. Gavin Newsom last fall vetoed another that aimed to protect the DNA samplesthat consumers mail to testing companies, saying he worried it would interfere with Covid-19-related data reporting. Another bill that would have expanded a state medical information lawto include health data collected by websites and apps also died last summer. The privacy agenda for the session is still taking shape.\nHOW TO BUILD A VAX CAMPAIGN:\nCommunity organizers are mobilizing armies of Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and TikTok users to reassure followers that Covid vaccines are safe as they become available to a wider swath of the general public.\nIts not an easy task. Coordinating messaging, stamping out misinformation and figuring out whose voices are trusted on those different platforms are just some of their early challenges.\nPernessa Seele, head of The Balm In Gilead, says the nonprofit is crafting a vaccine campaign aimed at answering peoples questions without dismissing fears stemming from medical institutions historical mistreatment of minority communities. (Her organization taps faith-based groups to spread public health information, especially to African American communities.)\nWe definitely have to strike a balance around, Why are you concerned, and your concerns are valid, and Why you need to take the vaccine, Seele said. For instance, her organization will directly address the Tuskegee study, in which the government left syphilis untreated in a group of Black men. The reality is many of us living today dont even know what the Tuskegee study was about, as well as the new research guardrails put in place as a result, she said.\nMark Lennihan, Pool/AP Photo\n...Seele is planning a social media campaign on Covid-19\nthat enlists celebrities as well as local community leaders. The person who just took their vaccine in Chicago who runs the neighborhood art gallery is just as important as Bishop Horace Smith, she said, referencing a Chicago megachurch leader.\nBut the content of those messages will vary depending on the targeted\ndemographic. In her experience, Seele says, older people have questions about where and how to get the vaccines. Younger ones are more skeptical about the science, she adds. Older ones flock to Facebook, younger ones to Twitter and Instagram. We have to make sure that those we",

        "utterance": "Stars Honor Bob Saget\nAs for the pricing differences between The MYX II The MYX II Plusand the Peloton, here's the breakdown.\nThe MYX II Bike, which includes the Star Trac Studio 5 Bike, a 21.5\" swivel tablet, a cadence/speed/distance sensor, plus a Polar OH1 heart rate monitor, is $1,399 not including the $39/month membership, which is slightly lower than Peloton's $1,495 base price.\nBut for a limited time you can save even more on your MYX II Bike! With code: MYXHAPPY100, you can score $300 in savings by getting $100 off + free shipping and assembly ($200 value). Might we add, the delivery and assembly service was incredible, professional and fast! And the bikes comes with a 12-month manufacturer's warranty.\nIf you're looking to mostly pedal your heart out, we suggest The MYX II, but if you're looking to create the ultimate home gym, we suggest going for The MYX II Plus\nThe MYX II Plus\nThe MYX II Plus\nincludes everything The MYX II has, but it comes with a 6-piece weight set and kettlebell (available in different color shades), the Stabilizer Mat, an exercise mat, an EVA foam roller, plus a resistance band. The Plus puts you at $1,599 (not including the limited-time discount and membership), which is still over $300 cheaper than Peloton's Bike Family Package.\nMYXfitness\nBesides the lower price tag, what else made me fall in love with the MYX II more than the Peloton? There's a lot of reasons, but I'll highlight just a few.\nThere's something about the overall feel of the MYX II bike that's more personal. The swivel screen makes it easier to do off-bike workouts, which was one issue I had with the Peloton. I would try to do burpees or other workout moves and would trip over the bike in the process. Additionally, The MYX II offers handlebar height and depth adjustments and a larger pedal diameterall things that make a difference for someone like me who is on the shorter side. Plus, the bike comes in white and black to match the interior of your home gym, closet or corner of the house dedicated to fitness.\nBut, the coolest feature in my opinion is there are separate coach and music volume controls, which the Peloton doesn't have. Some days you want to feel like you're in a bootcamp and have your instructor is your ear telling you that you're doing great or to up the resistance; but sometimes you want to get lost in the playlist and focus less on the trainer's commands.\nWhile I miss some of the Peloton instructors, I'm falling in love with MYXfitness' lineup of trainers. They're fun, encouraging and know how to help you break a sweat in an engaging way. Plus, the classes are available to stream on an app, so you can do trainer-led walking, running and pilates sessions on the go.\nI could go on and on about all of the other ways The MYX II Bike hits it out of the park in the fitness arena, but I'll let you do your own research. At the end of the day, the way you sweat is up to you. But with 2022 just a few days away, I'd suggest treating yourself to The MYX Bike II because those abs and toned legs aren't going to happen on their own!\nNow that you have your new fave workout, head over to\nLululemon to get some stylish activewear on sale\n!",

The round was led by BioX Clan, which specializes in early stage funding for new bioscience technologies. Other investors included Seerave Foundation and SOSV, which was following up on its pre-seed investment in BiomeSense via the biotech accelerator program, IndieBio.\nFounded in 2018, the Chicago, IL-based BiomeSense is revolutionizing human microbiome research by developing novel technologies to enable investigators to collect, store, and analyze the daily microbiome profiles of clinical trial participants in a low-cost, scalable way. By enabling daily profiling, the platform allows investigators the unprecedented ability to tie microbiome changes directly to clinical outcomes in real time, dramatically increasing the research discovery potential.\nThe human microbiome is the next frontier of precision medicine with enormous possibilities for improving our health, said Kevin Honaker, BiomeSense co-founder and CEO. Understanding how and why the microbiome changes over time is key to fully unlocking that potential, but today, getting continuous data at a reasonable cost is impossible.\nNow, thanks to the confidence of our funding and research partners, well be able to launch the first-ever solution to that problem in human trials next year.\nWere delighted to be leading BiomeSenses seed round, said Ho Joon Lee, CEO of BioX Clan. Their ground-breaking approach to continuous microbiome analysis has the potential to revolutionize the diagnostic use of microbiome data and bring tangible benefits to human health.\nWith the seed funding, BiomeSense will complete its prototype biosensor and data modeling platform in preparation for first clinical trials, scheduled for 2020. Those trials were oversubscribed within weeks of their availability, reflecting the widespread support BiomeSense has received from the research community since its launch from the Polsky Center at the University of Chicago.\nIndicating the breadth of the impact a better understanding of the gut microbiome can have on human health, those trials will investigate cancer progression, immunotherapy response, surgical recovery and athletic performance.\nWe have barely scratched the surface of understanding the power of the microbiome, said Dr. Jack Gilbert, BiomeSense co-founder and principal investigator. Recent work by the Human Microbiome Project and others has shown that to fully understand microbiomedisease interactions, we need large-scale studies that track microbiome changes over time, but until now we havent had the tools to make those possible.\nBiomeSense is developing an at-home biosensor to produce continuous gut microbiome data and a cloud-based analytics platform to turn that data into actionable clinical insights. The company provides this solution to scientists studying the microbiome, delivering dramatically more data over the course of a trial than currently available and enabling an unprecedented understanding of how short-term changes in the microbiome influence clinical outcomes.\n0",

Fewer overdoses occurred in rural areas, but the numbers still increased in 2020.\nKathryn Deuvel, Carris Health Addiction Serivces, Willmar\nIt was a wake-up call, said Deuvel, part of a team that started the Addiction Servicesprogram at the\nCarris Health-Willmar Main Clinic\nin April 2020.\nThe timing wasnt ideal, just after the pandemic started, said Holly Morales, a family practice physician assistant on the team.\nPeople didn't know what we had to offer, she said, but as people were referred to the program or heard about it on social media, the staff became increasingly busy.\nHolly Morales, Carris Health Addiction Services, Willmar\nThe program sees patients dealing with all kinds of substance use disorders, whether with opioids, alcohol, nicotine, methamphetamine or other other drugs.\nWillmar had not had a program offering medication-assisted treatment until Deuvel, Morales and Dr. Scott Abrams began it. Abrams works with Project Turnabout treatment programs in Granite Fallsand also works with inmates in the Stearns County Jailin St. Cloud Morales also works with Project Turnabout\nMedication-assisted treatment offering drugs that help curb cravings and reduce withdrawal symptoms can help prevent relapse and maintain abstinence, according to the\nU.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.\nA SAMHSA report lists the ability to offer medication-assisted treatment in primary care settings and not only specialized treatment programs as a key advantage.\nBefore the program in Willmar, people were driving two to three hours to see a doctor who prescribed their medication. The drugs are prescribed as part of a broad program that includes counseling and treatment.\nAddicts still need to work hard to find sobriety, said Abrams, who is a recovering addict himself.\nIm not going to give you the magical pill thats going to make you sober; I wanted that back in the day, Abrams said.\nDr. Scott Abrams, Carris Health Addiction Services, Willmar\nI would say to anyone, dont come into this thinking youre just going to take a pill and be fine, Abrams said. If you rely on a pill to change your behavior, you will fail every time.\nAbrams is in recovery from an addiction to opioid pain medication. Seven years ago, he lost his job as an emergency physician and his licenses to practice medicine and prescribe drugs.\nAfter he completed a treatment program, the clinic hired him to work in urgent care under close supervision. His licenses have since been restored, and his experiences led him to practice addiction medicine.\nBefore drugs like Suboxone or several others were available locally, some addicts tried to buy them on the streets, Deuvel said.\nThe trouble is theres no quality control from a drug dealer, she said.\nLike many other illegal drugs, they may have had fentanyl in them.\nFentanyl is a very strong drug and a big risk of overdose for people buying illegal drugs. Theres fentanyl in everything, Deuvel said.\nPatients will still have to work hard to overcome their addiction, Abrams said, and the program offers options for them.\nPatients can be referred to several outpatient treatment programs in the area.\nFor those who need to keep their jobs and are trying to keep their families intact, outpatient treatment is an option, he said.\nIt still requires a major commitment three nights a week, but they can stay in their community.\nInpatient treatment is another option.\nSome are worried about losing their jobs if they go to inpatient treatment. Abrams uses himself as an example and tells them that if they keep using, the job has a way of going away on its own.\nMorales said some patients come and go from the program. Some treatment programs in the past were strict with people whove started using again. In Willmar, the idea is to encourage them to try again.\nWhat we hope is they eventually find their way back to us, Morales said. Theyre so used to being chastised for missing appointments. ... Thats not what were about.\nMorales said she developed an interest in treating addiction after conversations with patients in her family practice about their substance use.\nPatients are thankful they can be treated in their local community and that they dont have to feel ashamed if they make a mistake and start using again, Deuvel said.\nIts a group of people who deserve way better treatment than communities and medical systems have given, she said. We dont shame people who have to take high blood pressure meds or have diabetes, why do we have to shame people with opioid addiction.\nThe idea that addicts are seeking quick pleasure is a misconception That part goes away pretty quickly, and then its the avoidance of the negative, Deuvel said.\nIts not a choice, either.\nIf you had your life controlled by a chemical that was hard to get, expensive and caused emotional trauma and shame for you and your family, would you choose to use that? she asked.\nAbrams said most people can come to some understanding of addiction through their own experiences.\nEverybodys got their thing they wish they didn't do that they keep doing, he said.\nIt might be something innocuous, like eating doughnuts or ice cream. The reward pathways in the brain are similar, regardless of the substance.\nIm not going to jail when I eat unhealthy food; its not the same thing, but thats how people can understand, he said.\nDeuvel was asked to develop the program by Dr. Cindy Firkins Smith, the former head of the clinic and now vice president of rural health for Carris Health's parent organization CentraCare\nSmith asked her to develop a thorough approach for dealing with the problem of opioid addiction and overdoses, Deuvel said.\nDeuvel spent many years at the clinic as an obstetrician/gynecologist. She delivered lots of babies How could you have a better job than that? but physical problems with her hands made it impossible for her to continue in that field.\nShe earned a masters degree in health care delivery and Smith asked her to come back to Willmar to work on quality innovations. For Deuvel, it felt like coming home.\nDeuvel said she looked at prevention, treatment and recovery, and found gaps in the system.\nWe developed a toolkit to help decrease the number of opioid prescriptions, she said.\nIts a balancing act, she said, of providing adequate treatment for pain while avoiding prescribing opioids wh",

        "utterance": "Email\nFew verticals are as vital or as global as the chemical industry, where the raw materials that cross borders find their way into everything from computer chips to potato chips. Shortages of those chemicals and bottlenecks in supply chains ultimately translate into shortages on shelves of everything from beauty products to paint cans.\nAnd yet, the chemical buying process itself, in which buyers connect with suppliers, place orders and get them fulfilled, is archaic and paper based. As ChemDirectCEO Tyler Ellisontold Karen Webster, Its extraordinarily opaque.\nIts a highly fragmented market, too, said Ellison, marked by $6 trillion in sales volume but where even major players have low single-digit market share.\nIts also marked by intermediaries including distributors, so transparency into end demand (and supply) is, to put it mildly, less than optimal. There are any number of causes of friction in the supply chain, said Ellison, tied to regulatory and political events everything from pandemics to production disruptions to tariffs.\nThe inefficient sales cycles can be improved considerably, he said, with two-sided automated, direct and digital marketplaces that bring buyers and sellers online in an experience that changes not just sourcing and price discovery, but the entire procurement process.\nThe urgency is there, and Ellison said ChemDirects genesis stems from his own time as CEO of a chemicals manufacturing company that led to frustration with lack of visibility into end markets and the multiple steps involved in getting orders in place.\nThe conversation came amid ChemDirects announcement earlier this month that it had launched version 2.0 of its website, with enhanced point, click and buy capabilities, as well as faster delivery speeds.\nIn terms of mechanics, as the platform is embedded into enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems via application programming interfaces (APIs), a chemical buyer can shop on the marketplace for the best pricing from verified chemical suppliers and manufacturers. The manufacturers, he said, are vetted (internally) by the platform (additional verification and security checks come from the payments partners).\nSuppliers are given a digital storefront at no cost, allowing buyers to shop directly and access those suppliers marketing materials and accreditation certificates. Along the way, he said, eliminating the distributors from the equation (and from the marketplace) allows those suppliers to build up their brands as they become known and trusted by the buyers.\nFinding the Tipping Point\nIn constructing the marketplace, which debuted last year and took six months to build, once wed reached that tipping point, the customer acquisition has been very good, said Ellison.\nHe added that the most recent enhancement of the site serves all manner of buyers and suppliers, from larger firms down to technical buyers (who scout for chemicals with different characteristics and even impurities) to occasional buyers who might be considered long tail users.\nThe companys platform also has payments functionality built in. Ellison noted that ChemDirect has partnered with Balance, a B2B payments firm, and Stripe to offer terms across a range of payments optionality, from ACH to cards. The payments functionality built into the platform allows payments to be staged based on certain milestones or approvals and receipts.\nAnd in a departure from what seems to be the fashion du jour no blockchain or cryptocurrencies are in the mix.\nThe Logistics Puzzle\nBeyond payments, Ellison said that one key failing of most B2B eCommerce sites centers on the fulfillment side of the equation. The average time till fulfillment in the chemicals space lasts anywhere from 12 to 20 weeks; the average fulfillment time with ChemDirect is three and a half days.\nOne of the of the things weve learned about institutional buyers is that they like a permission-based system, he said. If youre the procurement director, you might have 15,000 of monthly permissions to buy, and weve digitized that whole process. Knitting together a more digital value chain and skipping all those steps benefits everybody.\nThat shortened fulfillment time has positive ripple effects up and down supply chains as firms cut down on their inventory and re-ordering costs, he said.\nIn the future, the platform will continue to bring buyers and sellers together globally, with focus on the largest production regions in Asia, including India and China, and the largest consumption regions, marked by the U.S. and western Europe, he said.\nFurther advances in payments will be tied to continued efforts to understand the processes and constraints around foreign producers. As Ellison said: Some of them need prepayments, others do not. Still other firms can forward position inventory under a range of terms. We need to map out workflows before we overlay solutions.\nMonetizing the Data\nThe wealth of data accumulated on the platform across buyers and sellers can hint at changes in the market in the surpluses or shortages that loom. Case in point: Ellison recounted how in the early throes of the pandemic, isopropyl alcohol (and all the things that go into it) saw spikes in demand in the thousands of percentage points. In March of last year, ChemDirect was among the only places that had access to isopropyl alcohol. Passing the demand data along to the manufacturer allowed it to adjust its production.\nWe consider ourselves the demand scouts of the industry, he said, with data that may be, eventually, monetized while creating a B2C experience in a B2B marketplace.",

The purchase means that Seaport Community Health Care Center in Belfast, which is part of PCHC, will be able to grow. More than that, though, the nonprofit organization is looking to use its new location to increase access to health care and fill wellness gaps in the community, although its at the early stages of figuring out what that will look like.\nIts an incredibly exciting opportunity, for us and the whole community, Lori Dwyer, the president and chief executive officer of Penobscot Community Health Care, the largest federally qualified health center in Maine, said Tuesday. We really see ourselves as part of the community economic development plan.\nThesale is expected to breathe new life into a complex that once served as an economic engine for the region but has grown much quieter since its heyday in the early 2000s.\nWe have lots of thoughts, Dwyer said. Were exploring and researching the kind of aligned services that will be a good fit for that campus. None of this is definitive. I cant emphasize enough how much input well be seeking from the community.\nThe organization, which announced in July that it was under contract to purchase the campus, had a virtual real estate closing on Friday. It bought the property from current owner STAG IV Belfast LLC, part of real estate investment company Stag Capital of Boston. Prior to that, it was owned by Bank of America, which acquired it after buying MBNA in 2005.\nRight now, PCHCs firm plans for the campus revolve around Building 5,a 72,000- square foot structure which will be renovated to be the new home for Seaport Community Health Center. The health center, which has 8,000 patients, now operates in a leased, 11,800- square foot building at 53 Schoodic Drive in Belfast, around the corner from the new property. It offers primary care, mental health services, recovery services, a pharmacy and more, and is bursting at the seams, according to officials, who said it needs to more than double its size to meet current and future needs.\nTheres more than enough space in the new building, where the practice will occupy the first floor, with the second floor reserved for PCHC administrative and other uses. The organization has secured a federal grant to help with the renovations of the building, Dwyer said. Future services offered there will include dental care and expanded mental health and recovery programs.\nThe largest structure, Building 8, will continue to be occupied by Bank of America.\nAs for the development of the rest of the vacant office space and large campus, time will tell, she said. Ideas so far include a child care center and senior services.\nI think the broader vision is focused on community wellness, Dwyer said, adding that the organization plans to work cooperatively with other health care providers such as Waldo County General Hospital. We want to work with them and work with other people to identify whats missing. We want to fill in the gaps.\nWhatever happens, the campus is likely to look quite different than it did 20 years ago. At the height of MBNAs Belfast operations in the late 1990s and early 2000s, the company employed about 3,000 people there as debt collectors, call center workers and more, a number that equaled nearly half of the population of the midcoast city.\nBut things changed when Bank of America moved in. That companys much smaller workforce no longer needed the acres of climate-controlled cubicles, and sold part of the campus to Massachusetts-based athenahealth. The rest of the holdings eventually were sold to STAG IV. With some of the buildings empty or underused, the changing real estate reality led to a years-long dispute between STAG IV and the city of Belfast about the tax valuation for the property. In 2015, the city valued the property at $41 million, but after the city and the investment company came to an agreement in 2018, the assessed value has dropped to about a quarter of that sum.\nSTAG IV has remained one of the citys largest property taxpayers, nonetheless, paying $261,039 to Belfast last year.\nIn 2019, the company tried to sell the property at auction with bids starting at just $1.8 million, but itsreserve wasntmet so it wasnt sold.\nDwyer said that because her organization has a for-profit tenant at the property, the general rule that nonprofit organizations are exempt from paying property taxes does not applyto the property as a whole. She and others at the health care organization are looking forward to moving forward with renovations and plans. Were just excited, she said. Its a nice bright spot in the midst of this very gloomy pandemic.\nMore articles from the BDN\nTagged:",

Aging Baby Boomers-the Silver Tsunami want to age differently than their grandparents did, says Schonbrun. We are designing for ourselves.\nThe Great Room has immediate access to a lushly landscaped outdoor courtyard. NYC design firm Pembrooke & Ives and local developer Trammel Crow collaborated with Balfour on the 138-unit building featuring penthouses, a swimming pool, theatre and no large buy-in fees.\nNative Content\nA successful career as CEO of National Jewish Hospital and government nursing home regulator didnt come close to preparing Michael Schonbrun for the challenges of relocating his then recently widowed mother Madeline from the familys NYC apartment to senior living. The lessons learned from that journey is the origin story behind the soon-to-be-built Balfour at Palisades.\nQuality is our standard says Schonbrun, CEO of Balfour Senior Living, a collection of boutique senior living communities. My mothers\njoie de vivre\nand life-long appreciation for the finer things in life have inspired us to meet her high standards in creating beautiful communities and a lifestyle that fulfills and delights our residents.\nFounded 23 years ago, Balfour Senior Living is a Colorado-based company that started small by design and is now expanding its luxury boutique footprint to East Coast markets. It currently has 11 locations  ten in Colorado and one in Michigan and its Washington, D.C. and Brookline, MA communities are expected to deliver in 2023. Were not looking to be the biggest, explains Susan Juroe, the companys Co-founder, and General Counsel. Our goal is to be the best and most admired in our category by creating unique environments that enrich the lives of the people who live and work there. We also feel strongly about offering our residents a beautiful and compelling destination where their friends and families can also enjoy Balfours amenities and hospitality.\nThe architecture of Balfour at Palisades was informed by local art deco landmarks  the neighborhoods Glen Echo Amusement Park, MacArthur Theater, and the glamourous residential buildings of that era such as the Kennedy-Warren. Balfour partnered with the local developer Trammell Crow, award-winning architecture firm Perkins Eastman which brought the stylized art deco design to life, and NYC design firm Pembrooke and Ives who brought best-in-class residential design experience and made them ideal collaborators for this project.\nBalfour at Palisades will feature 138 apartment homes with a variety of floor plans, including studios, one- and two-bedrooms, one bedroom with dens and one- and two-bedroom penthouse apartments. Of these, ten units are part of D.C.s Inclusionary Zoning program and are income restricted. Residents will have the convenience of a range of services centered around their lifestyle and needs from independent living to assisted living, and memory care. The amenities include seasonally inspired culinary offerings at breakfast, lunch and dinner, seven days a week in three dining venues, indoor saltwater pool, sauna, fitness center and yoga studio, hair salon, theatre, a library, bar, housekeeping and home maintenance services, valet parking for residents and their guests, reserved covered parking, rooftop access and a Tesla fleet staffed with Balfour drivers to meet scheduled or spontaneous local transportation needs.\nThe Balfour at Palisades community spaces feature exceptional quality architecture, dcor and art where future residents can proudly welcome their families and friends.  The bar evokes the mood of some of DCs iconic clubs and restaurants.\nBalfours model does not have a large buy-in fee, instead charging monthly rent plus a la carte levels of care when or if needed. Its a model that requires Balfour to earn your trust every day and allow for flexibility should a relocation or changed life circumstances arise. Additionally, couples can stay together with care brought into their apartment home if needed.\nFor Michael Schonbrun and his partner Susan Juroe, a Georgetown resident for 20 years, Balfour represents a personal calling. We wanted to create places where residents can welcome their friends and families and enjoy wonderful experiences together. The Palisades is designed for ease of living and engagement within and beyond our community. Residents can enjoy all that the Palisades neighborhood offers  only steps away from their front door  and all that the Washington, D.C.  area has to offer. Another plus: Balfour is pet friendly. Residents can move in with their pets and Its common for some pet-less residents to adopt pets after theyve settled in. Balfour at Palisades will feature an indoor off-leash pet park and a pet grooming station.\nThe silver tsunami is nowhere close to cresting according to AARP and other senior advocacy groups. Baby Boomers (sorry, Millennials!) are still making their influence known in all sorts of ways. To be honest, we designed Balfour for ourselves. And for Madeline, of course! Michael admits. We thought seriously of what we would like and need to feel comfortable, what it meant to feel at home and have that pride of place  thats something were always working on. Susan adds, Were also mindful of the challenges people are facing as they age. Loneliness, depression, and lack of physical, mental, and emotional stimulation are real health hazards. At Balfour, were creating communities where everyone can feel valued and welcome and are free to discover new interests and friendships.\nLocal architects Perkins Eastman took inspiration from the art deco buildings in the Palisades as well as the grand historic residential buildings in Washington, DC to create a design compatible with the neighborhood. Balfour at Palisades is set to open in 2023.\nBalfour at Palisades will be located at 4865 MacArthur Blvd NW, D.C. 20007 and is expected to open in 2023. The leasing center address is 4418 MacArthur Blvd., NW. For more details or to schedule a meeting at their leasing center contact Eileen Alexander, Executive Director,",

UC Berkeley is home to Jennifer Doudna, who won a 2020 Nobel Prizewith Emmanuelle Charpentier for discovering the CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing technique.\nIt also complicatesthe work of some biotech companies to develop gene-editing therapies based on CRISPR: many, including companies like Caribou Biosciences (co-founded by Doudna) and Intellia Therapeutics, which licensed the CRISPR tech from the UC Berkeley group.\nThis decision once again confirmed Broads patents were properly issued, Broad Institute said in a statement. Broad believes that all institutions should work together to ensure wide, open access to this transformative technology.\nThe UC Berkeley group, collectively referred to as CVC, said in a statementthat it intends to challenge the decision. The group holds dozens of other CRISPR-related patents.\nThe decision is likely an end to a long-running fightover ownership of the gene-editing technique, which revolutionized genetic research and biotech. It lets scientists easily and precisely cut and and reorder bits of DNA, changing the way it codes for different functions. Doudna and her colleagues published the first paper on the CRISPR system in 2012, showing how it worked in a test tube. Then, in 2013, researchers at the Broad Institute published a paper on using CRISPR in the types of cells found in animals and people.\nBoth institutions filed for patents, and the US Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) initially awarded CRISPR patents to the Broad Institute in 2014. UC Berkeley contested the decision, and the PTO determinedin 2017 that the patents from the two institutions were different enough that they could both stand  and that the Broad Institute retained patents, potentially worth billions for the use of CRISPR in complex human and animal cells. UC Berkeley appealedto the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, DC, and lost that appeal\nThe ruling Monday was the result of another challengeUC Berkeley put before the Patent Trial and Appeal Board in 2019, pitting different CVC patents against the Broad Institutes patents. Once again, the PTO sided with the Broad Institute.\nBiotech companies that initially licensed technology from CVC will likely have to renegotiate with the Broad Institute. Companies that licensed from the Broad Institute, like genome editing company Editas Medicine, are more secure. The decision reaffirms the strength of our foundational intellectual property as we continue our work to develop life-changing medicines for people living with serious diseases, Editas CEO James Mullen said in a statement\nNext Up In\nSign up for the                  newsletter\nVerge Deals\nSubscribe to get the best Verge-approved tech deals of the week.\nJust one more thing!\nPlease confirm your subscription to Verge Deals via the verification email we just sent you.\nEmail\n(required)\nBy signing up, you agree to our Privacy Noticeand European users agree to the data transfer policy.\nSubscribe",

Developing innovative software is one thing but tech startups often lack the financial heft to venture into the somewhat dicey hardware side of the equation.\nIn akin's case, related to home hubs, ambient computing and hopefully, further down the line - robotic helpers.\nFor LG, the feeling is mutual as Dr. Sokwoo Rhee, senior vice president for innovation at LG Electronics and head of LG NOVA explains:\nWhen you develop technology with a clear vision and a clear goal, which is going to bring real value to people, thats when its going to have the highest impact.\nToo few companies have this type of vision from the outset while also being fully aligned with the philosophy of our challenge. Thats where we feel akin is different.\nOver the long-term, akin is passionate about hosting its sophisticated high-end chatbot inside a robot, whatever shape that might take, to provide physical support.\nAddressing the greatest need\nFor now, the priority remains in creating a software interface with the intention of easing the cognitive load on family caregivers. The company is adopting a universal design approach by initially honing in on disability use cases.\nRight now, a typical scenario might be that of Emily  a girl with cerebral palsy and mild intellectual impairment.\nEmilys mom might tell the AI that Emily wants to be more independent but is often late for school because she struggles to pack her school bag every day. She also has to be careful, as the bag cant be too heavy on account of her disability.\nThis goal will be relayed to Emilys personal avatar on her tablet who she has specially chosen to have long blue hair. The interface has also been rendered with large buttons to help her navigate better.\nEmilys avatar talks to her differently from mom when she is rushed off her feet in the morning getting the kids to school. Her assistant will remind her to pack her school bag the night before and be careful not to make it too heavy.\nAt the same time, Emilys older brother Jack is reminded by his avatar that its his turn to cook the dinner tomorrow night and the meal plan says its going to be vegetable pasta.\nThe akin interface\nakin\nLiesl Yearsley is CEO of akin and a world-leading artificial intelligence expert. She has founded three successful companies, including Cognea Artificial Intelligence, which was later acquired by IBM Watson.\nTwo of her children live with a disability.\nThe emotional load and level of organizational labor facing families living with a disability are significant, says Yearsley.\nIts around 10-15 hours a week. That is the key problem area we are working on with our software. We want to build an ambient, centralized AI that understands the goals of the family and individual, has empathy and can actualize as well.\nYearsley continues, We feel, in these early days, that we can manage much of this organizational load with software but when the technology gets there, we will have a physical assistance mode too.\nChanging expectations\nAcross wider society, there exists a rapidly expanding business case for help with managing domestic tasks and family affairs, that may not have existed, or at least not been fully appreciated, in previous decades.\nSometimes, when Ive engaged with the investment community  what I hear the most is  I just dont get the problem, says Yearsley.\nThis is because most of them have a chef, a housekeeper, nannies for the kids - a whole entourage that supports their household.But thats not how most of us live. Most people are cutting a 20-40 hour a week job in addition to what has to be done at home.\nFor the last couple of decades, the economics around this type of innovation might not have worked. But what's happening now is 72% of millennials are working parents and millennials are now the largest living generation.\nToday, its not like grandma's time where there is somebody unpaid doing this housework and it not being viewed as an economic cost. We now have this more vocal generation coming through with clearer ideas about the value of their time, says Yearsley.\nWhile the age of the robot butlers or even the super-intelligent Ai voice assistants living in the walls might not yet be upon us, its already a frontier opening up due to the innate desire of us as humans to innovate and explore.\nThats not to forget, the more modern era trend to want to make what we see in sci-fi movies come true in real life.\nThere are many hard yards to cover before we get there but understanding how to interweave technology into the granular and unique dynamics of individual family units seems like the perfect place to start.\nFollow me on",

Before the pandemic, Dr. Kathryn Deuvel said, she thought west central Minnesota might be turning a corner on the number of overdose deaths.\nBut with the pandemic drug overdoses and deaths in the region and across the country went right back up.\nMinnesotas overdose deaths had decreased in 2018, the numbers rebounded to previous levels in 2019 and skyrocketed in 2020 after the pandemic lockdowns began. Fewer overdoses occurred in rural areas, but the numbers still increased in 2020.\nKathryn Deuvel, Carris Health Addiction Serivces, Willmar\nIt was a wake-up call, said Deuvel, part of a team that started the Addiction Servicesprogram at the\nCarris Health-Willmar Main Clinic\nin April 2020.\nThe timing wasnt ideal, just after the pandemic started, said Holly Morales, a family practice physician assistant on the team.\nPeople didn't know what we had to offer, she said, but as people were referred to the program or heard about it on social media, the staff became increasingly busy.\nHolly Morales, Carris Health Addiction Services, Willmar\nThe program sees patients dealing with all kinds of substance use disorders, whether opioids, alcohol, nicotine, methamphetamine or other other drugs.\nWillmar had not had a program offering medication-assisted treatment until Deuvel, Morales and Dr. Scott Abrams began it. Abrams works with Project Turnabout treatment programs in Granite Falls and also works with inmates in the Stearns County Jail in St. Cloud. Morales also works with Project Turnabout.\nMedication-assisted treatment offering drugs that help curb cravings and reduce withdrawal symptoms can help prevent relapse and maintain abstinence, according to the\nU.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.\nA SAMHSA report lists the ability to offer medication-assisted treatment in primary care settings and not only specialized treatment programs as a key advantage.\nBefore the program in Willmar, people were driving two to three hours to see a doctor who prescribed their medication. The drugs are prescribed as part of a broad program that includes counseling and treatment.\nAddicts still need to work hard to find sobriety, said Abrams, who is a recovering addict.\nIm not going to give you the magical pill thats going to make you sober; I wanted that back in the day, Abrams said.\nDr. Scott Abrams, Carris Health Addiction Services, Willmar\nI would say to anyone, dont come into this thinking youre just going to take a pill and be fine, Abrams said. If you rely on a pill to change your behavior, you will fail every time.\nAbrams is in recovery from an addiction to opioid pain medication. Seven years ago, he lost his job as an emergency physician and his licenses to practice medicine and prescribe drugs.\nAfter he completed a treatment program, the clinic hired him to work in urgent care under close supervision. His licenses have since been restored, and his experiences led him to practice addiction medicine.\nBefore drugs like Suboxone or several others were available locally, some addicts tried to buy them on the streets, Deuvel said.\nThe trouble is theres no quality control from a drug dealer, she said.\nLike many other illegal drugs, they may have had fentanyl in them.\nFentanyl is a very strong drug and a big risk of overdose for people buying illegal drugs. Theres fentanyl in everything, Deuvel said.\nPatients will still have to work hard to overcome their addiction, Abrams said, and the program offers options for them.\nPatients can be referred to several outpatient treatment programs in the area.\nFor those who need to keep their jobs and are trying to keep their families intact, outpatient treatment is an option, he said.\nIt still requires a major commitment three nights a week, but they can stay in their community.\nInpatient treatment is another option.\nSome are worried about losing their jobs if they go to inpatient treatment. Abrams uses himself as an example and tells them that if they keep using, the job has a way of going away on its own.\nMorales said some patients come and go from the program. Some treatment programs in the past were strict with people whove started using again. In Willmar, the idea is to encourage them to try again.\nWhat we hope is they eventually find their way back to us, Morales said. Theyre so used to being chastised for missing appointments. ... Thats not what were about.\nMorales said she developed an interest in treating addiction after conversations with patients in her family practice about their substance use.\nPatients are thankful they can be treated in their local community and that they dont have to feel ashamed if they make a mistake and start using again, Deuvel said.\nIts a group of people who deserve way better treatment than communities and medical systems have given, she said. We dont shame people who have to take high blood pressure meds or have diabetes, why do we have to shame people with opioid addiction.\nThe idea that addicts are seeking quick pleasure is a misconception That part goes away pretty quickly, and then its the avoidance of the negative, Deuvel said.\nIts not a choice, either.\nIf you had your life controlled by a chemical that was hard to get, expensive and caused emotional trauma and shame for you and your family, would you choose to use that, she asked.\nAbrams said most people can come to some understanding of addiction through their own experiences.\nEverybodys got their thing they wish they didn't do that they keep doing, he said.\nIt might be something innocuous, like eating doughnuts or ice cream. The reward pathways in the brain are similar, regardless of the substance.\nIm not going to jail when I eat unhealthy food, its not the same thing, but thats how people can understand, he said.\nDeuvel was asked to develop the program by Dr. Cindy Firkins Smith, the former head of the clinic and now vice president of rural health for Carris Health's parent organization CentraCare.\nSmith asked her to develop a thorough approach for dealing with the problem of opioid addiction and overdoses, Deuvel said.\nDeuvel spent many years at the clinic as an obstetrician/gynecologist. She delivered lots of babies How could you have a better job than that? but physical problems with her hands made it impossible for her to continue in that field.\nShe earned a masters degree in health care delivery and Smith asked her to come back to Willmar to work on quality innovations. For Deuvel, it felt like coming home.\nDeuvel said she looked at prevention, treatment and recovery and found gaps in the system.\nWe developed a toolkit to help decrease the number of opioid prescriptions, she said.\nIts a balancing act, she said, of providing adequate treatment for pain while avoiding prescribing opioids whe",

        "utterance": "Don Wright is all about the numbers that he believes can save lives.\nHow does the Clarigent technology work? A therapist records conversations with a patient using the app with permission from parents and the child and gets feedback into their state of mind. Its speech analysis technology was created by researcher John Pestian of Cincinnati Childrens Hospital, using language patterns compiled from a database of more than 1,000 suicide letters as well as voice recordings taken from hospitals and emergency rooms in the Cincinnati area and West Virginia. The early trials show it is at least as effective as specialists at distinguishing between fake and fabricated suicide notes and in many cases, is actually better. One day, Wright hopes the technology will be able to pinpoint the best treatments too, the way doctors can recommend medicine or lifestyle changes to help address a heart attack.\nIt was hardly a given that Wright would make his mark in the Midwest. After graduating from Cincinnatis Xavier University with a computer science major and a business minor, he easily could have headed to Silicon Valley. Beginning his career at AT&Ts Bell Laboratories, the soccer lover worked a dozen years in product development for Seattle-based software company Attachmate and another three for Boston-based ProfitLogic but always keeping his home base in Cincinnati. Eventually, he found the most success and meaning by tapping into his hometowns budding entrepreneurial community. Of Assurex, he says, The most important thing that product ever did was get people off medications that would make them worse.\nWright is reluctant to make Clarigents story personal, instead referencing facts and stats, figures and tests. There are more problems to be worked out. Questions remain about whether regional accents say, the Southern drawl or New Englands dropped Rs will influence the app, or even how close the recorder should be to get an accurate reading. Should the app take video to interpret body language, or will patients be less open on camera?",

The CIRM-funded study led by Dr. Krystof Bankiewicz, is one of the 64 clinical trials funded by the California state agency to date.\nParkinsons is a neurodegenerative movement disorder that affects one million people in the U.S alone and leads to shaking, stiffness, and problems with walking, balance, and coordination. It is caused by the breakdown and death of dopaminergic neurons, special nerve cells in the brain responsible for the production of dopamine, a chemical messenger that is crucial for normal brain activity.\nThe patient was treated at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center with a gene therapy designed to promote the production of a protein called GDNF, which is best known for its ability to protect dopaminergic neurons, the kind of cell damaged by Parkinsons. The treatment seeks to increase dopamine production in the brain, alleviating Parkinsons symptoms and potentially slowing down the disease progress.\nWe are pleased to support this multi-institution California collaboration with Ohio State to take a novel first-in-human gene therapy into a clinical trial for Parkinsons Disease. says Maria T. Millan, M.D., President and CEO of CIRM. This is the culmination of years of scientific research by the Bankiewicz team to improve upon previous attempts to translate the potential therapeutic effect of GDNF to the neurons damaged in the disease. We join the Parkinsons community in following the outcome of this vital research opportunity.\nCIRM Board Member and patient advocate David Higgins, Ph.D. is also excited about this latest development. For Dr. Higgins, advocating for Parkinsons is a very personal journey since he, his grandmother, and his uncle were diagnosed with the disease.\nOur best chance for developing better treatments forParkinsons is to test as many logical approaches aspossible. CIRM encourages out-of-the-box thinking byproviding funding for novel approaches. The Parkinsons community is a-buzz withexcitement about the GDNF approach and looks to CIRM to identify, fund, and promote these kinds of programs.\nIn a news release Dr. Sandra Kostyk, director of the Movement Disorders Divisionat Ohio State Wexner Medical Center said this approach involves infusing a gene therapy solution deep into a part of the brain affected by Parkinsons: This is a onetime treatment strategy that could have ongoing lifelong benefits. Though its hoped that this treatment will slow disease progression, we dont expect this strategy to completely stop or cure all aspects of the disease. Were cautiously optimistic as this research effort moves forward.\nOther trial sites located in California that are currently recruiting patients are the University of California, Irvine (UCI) and the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). Specifically, the Irvine trial site is using the UCI Alpha Stem Cell Clinic one of five leading medical centers throughout California that make up the CIRM Alpha Stem Cell Clinic (ASSC) Network. The ASSC Network specializes in the delivery of stem cell therapies by providing world-class, state of the art infrastructure to support clinical research.\nFor more information on the trial and enrollment eligibility, you can directly contact the study coordinators by email at the trial sites listed:\nThe Ohio State University:",

        "utterance": "Email\nFew verticals are as vital or as global as the chemical industry, where the raw materials that cross borders find their way into everything from computer chips to potato chips. Shortages of those chemicals and bottlenecks in supply chains ultimately translate into shortages on shelves of everything from beauty products to paint cans.\nAnd yet, the chemical buying process itself, in which buyers connect with suppliers, place orders and get them fulfilled, is archaic and paper based. As ChemDirectCEO Tyler Ellisontold Karen Webster, Its extraordinarily opaque.\nIts a highly fragmented market, too, said Ellison, marked by $6 trillion in sales volume but where even major players have low single-digit market share.\nIts also marked by intermediaries including distributors, so transparency into end demand (and supply) is, to put it mildly, less than optimal. There are any number of causes of friction in the supply chain, said Ellison, tied to regulatory and political events everything from pandemics to production disruptions to tariffs.\nThe inefficient sales cycles can be improved considerably, he said, with two-sided automated, direct and digital marketplaces that bring buyers and sellers online in an experience that changes not just sourcing and price discovery, but the entire procurement process.\nThe urgency is there, and Ellison said ChemDirects genesis stems from his own time as CEO of a chemicals manufacturing company that led to frustration with lack of visibility into end markets and the multiple steps involved in getting orders in place.\nThe conversation came amid ChemDirects announcement earlier this month that it had launched version 2.0 of its website, with enhanced point, click and buy capabilities, as well as faster delivery speeds.\nIn terms of mechanics, as the platform is embedded into enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems via application programming interfaces (APIs), a chemical buyer can shop on the marketplace for the best pricing from verified chemical suppliers and manufacturers. The manufacturers, he said, are vetted (internally) by the platform (additional verification and security checks come from the payments partners).\nSuppliers are given a digital storefront at no cost, allowing buyers to shop directly and access those suppliers marketing materials and accreditation certificates. Along the way, he said, eliminating the distributors from the equation (and from the marketplace) allows those suppliers to build up their brands as they become known and trusted by the buyers.\nFinding the Tipping Point\nIn constructing the marketplace, which debuted last year and took six months to build, once wed reached that tipping point, the customer acquisition has been very good, said Ellison.\nHe added that the most recent enhancement of the site serves all manner of buyers and suppliers, from larger firms down to technical buyers (who scout for chemicals with different characteristics and even impurities) to occasional buyers who might be considered long tail users.\nThe companys platform also has payments functionality built in. Ellison noted that ChemDirect has partnered with Balance, a B2B payments firm, and Stripe to offer terms across a range of payments optionality, from ACH to cards. The payments functionality built into the platform allows payments to be staged based on certain milestones or approvals and receipts.\nAnd in a departure from what seems to be the fashion du jour no blockchain or cryptocurrencies are in the mix.\nThe Logistics Puzzle\nBeyond payments, Ellison said that one key failing of most B2B eCommerce sites centers on the fulfillment side of the equation. The average time till fulfillment in the chemicals space lasts anywhere from 12 to 20 weeks; the average fulfillment time with ChemDirect is three and a half days.\nOne of the of the things weve learned about institutional buyers is that they like a permission-based system, he said. If youre the procurement director, you might have 15,000 of monthly permissions to buy, and weve digitized that whole process. Knitting together a more digital value chain and skipping all those steps benefits everybody.\nThat shortened fulfillment time has positive ripple effects up and down supply chains as firms cut down on their inventory and re-ordering costs, he said.\nIn the future, the platform will continue to bring buyers and sellers together globally, with focus on the largest production regions in Asia, including India and China, and the largest consumption regions, marked by the U.S. and western Europe, he said.\nFurther advances in payments will be tied to continued efforts to understand the processes and constraints around foreign producers. As Ellison said: Some of them need prepayments, others do not. Still other firms can forward position inventory under a range of terms. We need to map out workflows before we overlay solutions.\nMonetizing the Data\nThe wealth of data accumulated on the platform across buyers and sellers can hint at changes in the market in the surpluses or shortages that loom. Case in point: Ellison recounted how in the early throes of the pandemic, isopropyl alcohol (and all the things that go into it) saw spikes in demand in the thousands of percentage points. In March of last year, ChemDirect was among the only places that had access to isopropyl alcohol. Passing the demand data along to the manufacturer allowed it to adjust its production.\nWe consider ourselves the demand scouts of the industry, he said, with data that may be, eventually, monetized while creating a B2C experience in a B2B marketplace.",

        "utterance": "LinkedIn\nWhen Melissa Chan was 18 years old, her father went missing again. It had happened four years earlier, but this time he'd been gone for two days. His dementia had gotten worse.\nWe stayed in Woodlands. My mum had dropped him off at his office at Potong Pasir, and when she went to pick him up, she couldnt find him and started panicking, Melissa recalled. There was no Facebook. We had to SMS everyone, and the police followed the missing persons protocol, which meant waiting for 24 hours.\nMelissa Chan with her siblings and her father. (Photo: Melissa Chan)\nHer father was eventually found sitting on a sofa a few blocks from their home he had somehow managed to find his way to the neighbourhood, but not quite home.\nWhen I think about it, I can imagine how painful and confused he was sitting there. When I saw him at the police station, his shirt was tucked out and he had lost his shoes, said Melissa. The sofa he was sitting in was the same colour as the one we used to have.\nProject We Forgot founder and Homage's head of community and outreach Melissa Chan at the latter's office. (Photo: Alvin Teo)\nThat incident, along with many others as she, her siblings and their mother struggled to care for her father, would eventually prompt the 28-year-old Singaporean to start a social enterprise for dementia caregivers and, later, join an even bigger start-up with bigger aspirations.\nGIVING SUPPORT FOR CAREGIVERS\nFounded shortly after Melissa's father passed away in 2014, the much-lauded Project We Forgothas been actively functioning as a kind of support group for caregivers of persons with dementia, through online forums, workshops and other activities.\nMelissa Chan with volunteers and members of Project We Forgot. (Photo: Project We Forgot>\nIt was community that her family didnt have back then. As a family, we never spoke about it. My mother was struggling to figure out what was happening to her husband, and care for us, said Melissa. Id cancel appointments with friends because I felt a sense of guilt. I decided not to go overseas for education because a part of me worried that my father would forget who I was when I came back.\nOne lightbulb moment to start PWF would also come from an unlikely source: Comedian Seth Rogen.\nHes seen as someone super funny but I saw him speaking in (US) Congress about dementia his wifes mother had it and the two of them had to care for her. I was very impressed because he was using a different way to educate them about the condition, and the struggles of caregivers,\" she said.\n\"I realised there was nothing like that in Singapore. When you Google, you see Western faces. Any information was very medical, and research papers. But its a very human journey.\"\nStarting PWF entailed a sharp career detour. Melissa had previously worked in the hospitality and tech industries (in marketing and communications for W Hotels and later, a travel tech start-up) but both experiences proved crucial.\nI realised that at the end of the day, its about taking (complicated information) and making it accessible for people to digest.\nShe and her PWF team turned to social media after discovering there were caregivers overseas who were using Instagram as a platform. They were sharing stories, talking about day-to-day experiences, videoing themselves about their struggles.\nAnd it worked. Today, PWF continues to organise activities in Singapore (most recently a dementia-friendly design-a-thon at the National Design Centre) and they are aiming to grow in Malaysia, where theyre holding a film event in time for World Alzheimers Month this September. Alzheimer's contributes a large percentage to cases of dementia, which is an umbrella term, said Melissa.\nThey have have also gotten support from organisations like the National Youth Council, Alzheimer's Disease Association and Singtel, which had named it one of its Future Makers start-up companies in 2017.\nCONNECTING CAREGIVERS AND THE ELDERLY\nBut PWF was just the start of her advocacy. Early this year, Melissa also joined Homage another local start-up that is also expanding to Malaysia, which helps connect caregivers with the elderly and their family.\nI decided not to go overseas for education because a part of me worried that my father would forget who I was when I came back.\nFor Melissa, whos now also head of Homages community and outreach, it was a chance to offer something that PWF could not.\nWeve been doing the emotional well-being support (for caregivers at PWF) and now, Homage has a platform to provide on-demand care (for patients).\nIn a nutshell, said Melissa, it's something like Grab but for elderly care.\nThe company has a pool of care professionals, or \"Care Pros\", that people can tap into by using an app or going online, whether its to send a loved one for a medical check-up or simply to look after them at home.\nProject We Forgot founder Melissa Chan is now also head of community and outreach at Homage, which connects caregivers with the elderly. (Photo: Alvin Teo)\nTHE IMPORTANCE OF TECHNOLOGY\nIt might seem strange to be bringing up technology when talking about an issue where physical, human interaction is whats most vital, but Melissa says being connected has actually become crucial as the population ages and families become smaller and often busy at work.\nThere is a need to shift the way care is delivered, especially if youre looking at the topic of longterm care for an ageing population, she said. If a family needs a caregiver in the next two days, can they get it or do they wait two to three weeks, for example.\nWhenever I think of services at Homage, I think about how my family couldve used it just a few hours to ensure that someone was home to watch over my dad.\nOn top of that, people who are tech-savvy will want information at their fingertips its no longer just putting a parent in a nursing home or with a caregiver and not knowing whats happening for a few hours. Just knowing how your parent is doing there is a big role for technology to play in this space,\" said Melissa.\nFor example, being connected means one can be updated on how the medical appointment or house visit went without being physically there. And the Care Pros, too, can access previous information about the client-patient through the app so theyre prepared before even entering the home.\nThe Homage app lets you book a caregiver for your family member. (Photo: Homage)\nThe current pool of Care Pros number around 1,000, which is a mix of nurses, therapists and non-nurses who are able to provide support. And theyre in-demand. Every hour were delivering care right now, Melissa told CNA Lifestyle.\nJoining Homage also resonated with Melissa on a very personal level.\nWhile taking care of her father, there were times when the familys schedules wouldnt sync and they had to sometimes resort to locking him up at home.\nIt was dangerous and we knew it wasnt the right thing to do, but it was our only option sometimes, she said, sadly.\nMelissa C",

The steps are part of the firm's shift away from a heavy focus on COVID related vaccines and therapeutics, to a new lineup of promising investments in the biotech space.\nThessalus CEO Dr. Mitchell Ng\nDr. Jason Ngo, newly appointed to Thessalus Capital Advisory Board\n\"When COVID began in\nMarch 2020\n, our physician-managed investment firm was one of the first to recognize the huge market potential in companies developing treatments for this unprecedented health crisis,\" says Thessalus Managing Director and President, Dr.\nMitchell Ng\n.  \"We bet big on companies developing COVID vaccines and therapeutics, like Moderna (MRNA), Regeneron (REGN), and Pfizer (PFE).\"\n\"We maintained significant positions and are very happy with how those played out,\" says Dr. Ng. Moderna was the biggest winner, going from little-known startup to premier global developer of mRNA vaccines. Its stock price rose 800% since\nJanuary 2020\n. Stock prices of Regeneron and Pfizer, which developed a COVID antibody treatment and COVID mRNA vaccine, respectively, saw similarly eye-popping gains.\nNevertheless, with COVID moving to endemic status, Thessalus is reaching the \"end of the road with regards to its COVID play,\" says Ng. \"We're closing positions and re-focusing on our pre-pandemic biotech lineup including CRISPR gene editing technologies, CAR-T cancer immunotherapies, monoclonal antibody treatments, among others.\"\nTo that end, says Managing Director Dr.\nKenneth Ng\n, the firm is appointing Dr.\nJason Ngo\nto its Advisory Board.\n\"Dr. Ngo is one of the best analysts of midsize biotech market caps I've encountered in my medical career.

He played a real role in our successful investment in Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX).\"\n\"This appointment is a resounding vote of confidence in Jason's abilities,\" Ng concludes.  \"Overall, these recent steps are a milestone, marking the end of a successful chapter in our fund, and first, exciting steps to ensure continued growth and expansion in coming years.\"\nAbout Thessalus Capital LLC:\nThessalus is a leading, \"content strong\" investment firm specializing in US and international life science industries. It takes a global, research-heavy approach, with narrow and deep focus on pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, diagnostic tools, and medical devices.

The primary aim is to define a tailored set of evidence-based metrics to transform performance across the entire Maternity Care Pathway.\nNNUH has moved from a paper-based auditing system, to measuring quality improvements digitally. The results show the Perfect Ward solution has helped to halve the time needed to perform audits while empowering staff to deliver outstanding maternity care across the pathway.\nYvonne Christley, Deputy Chief Nurse at Norfolk and Norwich University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust commented, For us the biggest benefit of using Perfect Ward is its ability to capture everything visually and the tagging functionality is great. At a glance, we can see metrics for every part of the maternity care pathway, by division and across the whole organisation.\nIt gives us rich and vivid data that is simple and easy to interpret. Audits can be now be done in half the time, hugely important when our target for audits is 20 minutes during this critical first phase. We could never have embarked on such an ambitious programme without an effective digital system like Perfect Ward.\nWhile eliminating the heavy administrative burden associated with auditing and giving staff extra time to look after patients, the transparency of the Perfect Ward mobile solution empowers staff by promoting accountability. Staff have truly engaged with the technology because they see the immediate results of their audits and are keen to share their success stories.\nAlan Birch, Chief Commercial Officer at Perfect Ward added, Perfect Ward's solution is perfectly designed to support bespoke and transformational quality programmes across NHS hospitals and all health and social care environments in these challenging times. Using mobile devices, managers have complete control of their quality metrics on the move, can view the results of live audits as they are completed and make meaningful improvements accordingly. For frontline staff, our technology is a powerful motivational tool making their roles easier, more engaging and helping to unleash their full potential.\nThe next step for NNUH is to test the new metrics and gain valuable patient feedback by involving the mothers themselves. December 2020 sees the launch of the Maternity Departments first Continuity of Care Team with the goal of having one full audit across the entire patient journey. Until now, nurses typically carried out their own individual audits for the mothers in their care. However, the success of the new project has inspired the team to utilise audits as a valuable vehicle for sharing learning and outstanding practice, along with areas that may require improvement.\nProfessor Nancy Fontaine, Chief Nurse at Norfolk and Norwich University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust concluded, Working with Perfect Ward is a pleasure. We benefit from an excellent working relationship and great communication allowing us to adapt our audits as required. I would have no hesitation in advocating Perfect Ward for its ease of use and powerful reporting to other organisations.\nNNUH expects to share the results of the next phase of its quality programme in the near future.

Yet, the company earned 5% higher net profit year over year on lower taxes and 3% growth in sales. More importantly, Clorox upgraded its full-year sales guidance to the higher end of its previous range of 1%-3%. On the flip side, it downgraded its fiscal 2018 earnings per share (EPS) outlook to $6.15-$6.30 from $6.17-$6.37. There's nothing to worry here, though.\nImage source: Clorox Company.\nIn March, Clorox announced plans to acquire health and wellness company, Nutranext for $700 million, to be financed through cash and debt. While Clorox expects the acquisition to add a percentage point to its top line this year (hence the revenue outlook upgrade), acquisition-related expenses are expected to dilute its earnings.\nInvestors were encouraged by Clorox's resilience amid challenging cost conditions. To top that, the company announced a share repurchase program worth $2 billion later in May, reflecting management's confidence in its long-term goals, which include 3%-5% growth in annual sales and conversion of 11%-13% annual revenue into free cash flows.\nRising cash flows should also mean higher dividends for shareholders: Clorox has already made a mark in the dividend world as a\nand rewarded shareholders with a good 14% increase in dividends earlier this year.\nSo what\nClorox's full-year outlook, after the downgrade, calls for a solid 16% growth in EPS at the midpoint. While the Nutranext acquisition is unlikely to be accretive before fiscal 2020, Clorox should still be able to grow its EPS at a decent clip next year. The growth potential in earnings and dividend, coupled with the buyback program, was good enough for the market to propel Clorox shares higher last month.\nMotley Fool Returns",

The pioneers of fermented whole foods and herbal supplements Paul and Barbi Schulick built one of the most successful nutraceutical brands in the industry. New Chapter helped change the paradigm for the supplement market at large and was eventually bought by Procter & Gamble in 2012.\nThe mission for the Schulicks continues today with For The Biome, a wellness company focused on raising awareness about the connection between physical health, mental well-being, and the environment.\nIn this interview, For The Biome Founder and CEO Paul Schulick discusses the new venture, the microbiome, and offers some advice for budding entrepreneurs.\nBeauty IO (BIO): What principles is the company founded on? Whats your mission and vision?\nPaul Schulick: Theres a Chinese proverb that says, Where there is pain there is no connection. Where there is connection there is no pain. If we can help ease pain and amplify connection, weve done our jobs.\nWere a wellness company raising consciousness around health, mental well-being, and our connection with the global biome. We aim to influence awakening within the self, the larger community, and the planet while retaining a radically honest ethos.\nOur foundational principle of treating as a whole to heal as whole has evolved into what we call True Holism. Our three-pronged approach supports connection of the mind, body, and community with freely offered live and guided meditation, skin care that leverages the skin-microbiome relationship, and an integrated philanthropic effort that donates at least 3% of every purchase to organizations supporting climate change reversal, sustainable housing, and empowering women.\nThe bond we share with our customers will play a key role in the realization of our vision, and to further support that bond, our True Transparency program will pull back the curtain on all production costs, pricing models, and sourcing information. We believe that the ultimate connection is only achieved when all our pathways are open\nand accessible.\nBIO: How has the company been developing?\nSchulick: We are moving quickly. Our website, www.forthebiome.com, will offer live and guided meditation programs as well as our Sentient Skincare product line.\nOur skin care is rooted in a deep respect for the skin and its microbiome as the third brain. The microbial universe that lives in and on the skin contains the wisdom and beneficial adaptations from past generations. We believe that when your microbiome flourishes, these generational lessons are passed on to your skin.\nSentient Skincare offers a simple three-step system to help do just that with exclusively whole ingredients and 100% active formulas that are capable of carrying robust conversations with both the skin and its microbiome. Essentially, this gives your skin and microbiome a legacy instruction manual for holistic protection and preservation.\nOur fermented and CO2 volcanic extracted bioactives help balance the skins environment, recalibrating where necessary, and maintaining whats already working. As a result, signaling pathways are primed as energized skin cells and a biodiverse microbiome takes root. Once this happens, connection is restored between the skin, its microbiome, and the rest of the body. Crosstalk between all systems is restored and nerves receive adaptogenic therapy that results in the skin looking and feeling healthier.\nWith no fillers or preservatives, we hope to initiate a new generation of clean beauty that leverages skin-microbiome harmony for a naturally radiant complexion.\nWere investing heavily in certifications and cellular and clinical studies to further validate our products and are thrilled with the results were seeing. From blue light protection to an adaptogenic effect on neuroendocrine markers like cortisol and oxytocin, these products are delivering the aesthetic benefits consumers seek with an additional layer of mind-body acknowledgement. Weve also received our vegan, organic, EWG, and cruelty-free certifications and are the first to receive an ONLA certification that validates our cleanser as microbiome-friendly. Additional certifications are in progress and this will remain a commitment to help consumers easily identify our standards.\nBIO: How has understanding of the microbiome evolved? What are you most excited about for the future?\nSchulick: Recent research published by Tel Aviv University has led many scientists to challenge Darwins theory of evolution. The proposed hologenome theory of evolution suggests that microbial genes and human genes come together to form a hologenome, where human genes are dramatically outnumbered by microbial genes. As the human genome evolves, the microbiome acts as our co-pilot, supplying a dynamic response to external stimuli. This partnership between human and microbial cells drives our evolution and is essential to how humans have adapted since the beginning of time.\nFast forward to today. The skin-microbiome relationship continues to play a crucial role in the health and function of our systems. Acting as a network over a network, your microbiome supports your skins sensory abilities while helping support barrier function. The result is skin that fully realizes its ability to see, hear, and even elicit shifts in emotion. You simply arent whole or functioning at peak capacity without a healthy skin-microbiome relationshipbut when its healthy, your skin can effectively function as your bodys third brain.\nGiven all the wisdom that resides in the microbiome, its cataclysmic to the behavior of your skin and body to strip yourself of this critical, living layer. Yet we do it regularly. Harsh skin care products, unhealthy lifestyles, pollution, and especially mental stress take their toll on our skin and microbiomes. Taking it one step further, both your skin and microbiome have a bilateral relationship with nature, and changes in the environment like the climate crisis, UV radiation, and pollution can elicit a chemical stress response in the skin which generates a variety of mood-shifting hormones and neurotransmitters. These shifts can block the crosstalk between your skin and microbiome, dulling the skins intrinsic barrier function and rejuvenating abilities. Its in this relationship between skin, microbiome, and the environment that we see the onset of the climate crisis as an additional skin-microbiome disruption that we must address.\nWere excited to introduce ingredients to the market that address this dynamic and send a friendly ripple through the biomesimultaneously supporting the skin and microbiome through topical application while uplifting the global macrobiome through obsessive sourcing practices and philanthropic efforts to ultimately, again, influence the health of your skin and microbiome.\nAll our ingredients support this cycle with our sourcing commitment of R.O.S.E.S.: all our ingredients must be reliable, organic, sustainab",

The three-day art and lifestyle fair welcomed a fairly good number of visitors on its opening day. A celebration of the theme, Free Your Mind, the fair is showcasing a range of artworks and experiences across a range of different styles, with works of 120+ solo artists and galleries from 20+ countries.\nAfter months of virtual exhibitions and Zoom openings, the artists, buyers, organisers, and visitors, had a field day out, as they attended the events for the day, including live art walks and painting sessions. In addition, the visitors took part in various workshops like learning button mosaic and paper collage skills. The three curators, incidentally all women, Batool Jafri, Samar Kamel, and Petra Kaltenbach, expressed their happiness and hope at the response, \"Until this noon, we were not sure of what to expect but within 20 minutes of the opening, we were certain of the event's success.\"\nAmong the many new features, this year are the digital art display, Urban Art DXB and a dedicated zone for sculptures and photographers. A wall with psychedelic colours, inspired by Alexa Meade and curated by Batool and Samar, a perfect Instagram friendly space to sit and get clicked was one of the most-visited (and sanitised, each time a person sat and left!) spot on day one! With only one or two visitors allowed in the art booths at a time, and floor stickers with words like, \"Social Distancing Expert\" and \"Wear your masks at all times,\" it was remarkable to note how the fair kept responsibility at its core mission.\nFor those looking to invest in art or simply adorn their homes with canvases, there are ample choices to select from works ranging in prices between $100 - $20,000. \"World Art Dubai remains an extremely innovative show that embraces every corner of the art world. We are leading the region's charge for the restart of events and have curated a show that embraces the latest trends while celebrating art traditions,\" said Trixie LohMirmand, Executive Vice President, Exhibitions  &  Events Management, DWTC.\nAll the venue entry points are equipped with thermal scanning, along with smart cameras to ensure social distancing protocols. The venue is getting regularly sanitised and hand sanitisers are available throughout the venue. All visitors are required to wear a mask at all times. The event is on until Saturday (1 pm to 9 pm), visitors can pre-book their tickets worldartdubai.com.\nA year of creativity and opportunity\nA. P. Laitu, one of the participating artists at World Art Expo 2020, said that this has been an unprecedented year in the history of mankind and did not even leave the art world untouched.\nHe added that at the same the year would be remembered as a year of creativity and opportunity. \"It gave us all ample time to create some good art.\" He shared that he is grateful to World Art Dubai for giving the artists the much-awaited platform to showcase their creativity and also meet and greet fellow artists from all over the world. \"This platform is also the evaluation of how constructively we all have spent our time during this period of lockdown and isolation.\"\nWhat is arty-fash style statement?\nIndividuality is the key, and while many of us wish to make a personal statement, we find it hard to express ourselves via colours, shapes and images. At Artify Station by multi-disciplinary artist Ella Orencillo, you can get a bespoke pair of shoes, a cap or a cloth bag, as the artist helps you define your style.\nElla, a Filipino, has been in Dubai for 13 years now. She quit her job in 2017 to be a full-time artist and started her company, Craftology, last year. \"I'd been pursuing art on the side, all this while though, as I worked as a receptionist, personal assistant, executive assistant, etc.\" She hand-painted a bag with Khaleej Times written in signature blue colour. \"People want to be different and have good ideas, but are unable to translate the same visually.

        "utterance": "Mad Max could be getting a new video game (pic: Warner Bros.)\n\n\n\nEvidence has emerged that Just Cause developer Avalanche Studios were working on a sequel to Mad Max, but its unclear if they still are\n\n\n\nConsidering what a massive influence the movies have had on the concept of a post-apocalyptic world, it is strange that theres only ever been one big budget game based on Mad Max.\n\n\n\nThere was a little known NES game back in 1990, and a SNES sequel that had to be renamed to Outlander because the publisher lost the licence, but the only adaptation worth talking about is the 2015 game by Just Cause and Rage 2 developer Avalanche Studios.\n\n\n\nAlthough a little formulaic at times, the game was generally well received and seemed to be at least a minor hint, but theres never been any hint of a follow-up, until the tweet below was spotted by fans.\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore times, at @AvalancheSweden in New York, when ONeil invited me to get scanned to be in Mad Max 2, as a rebel. The magic of #photogrammetry, 3D Scanning, & many cameras @MadMaxGame. pic.twitter.com/gIjzC3zM54 WENDY W FOK |  (@W_W_F) February 7, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tweet shows digital researcher Wendy W. Fox at Avalanches New York offices, having her face scanned using photogrammetry cameras, for what she describes as Mad Max 2.\n\n\n\nThe photo was apparently taken before the pandemic but other than stating that her face would have been used for a rebel character theres no information on what the game is and whether its still in development.\n\n\n\nIt is possible she may have been mistaken about what game she was been scanned for, as Avalanche also worked on the Mad Max-esque Rage 2. However, that was released in May 2019 and so unless shes underplaying how much earlier this was before the pandemic started, it doesnt seem likely that it was that.\n\n\n\n3D scanning technology was not used for the original Mad Max, in fact its poor quality character models were a notable flaw, so it does make sense that it would be something that Avalanche would want to improve in a sequel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheres also recently been talk of a new Mad Max film, a prequel focusing on the Furiosa character from Fury Road, thats supposed to start production this year.\n\n\n\nThat would certainly be a good reason to start work on a new game and while the tweet doesnt make any claim that the sequel is still in development  so it could have been cancelled  its certainly enough to remain hopeful.\n\n\n\nAvalanche is currently working on Xbox console exclusive Contraband for Microsoft but theyre big enough to have two major games in production at once, with the original Mad Max releasing the same year as Just Cause 3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail gamecentral@metro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter.\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\tMORE : Fortnite leaks point to Mad Max crossover following Season 7 finale\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\tMORE : Mad Max review  Fallout on wheels\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\tMORE : Mad Max preview and interview  Australian U-turn\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\nFollow Metro Gaming on Twitter and email us at gamecentral@metro.co.uk\n\n\n\nFor more stories like this,check our Gaming page.",

Some stand out as winners of the 2021 Bethpage Best of Long Island contest.\nThe winners include Medford Volunteer Ambulance, which won the title of Best Medical Transportation Company on Long Island, and Stony Brook University Hospital, which won the title of Best Maternity Ward on Long Island.\nEach of these health organizations rose to the top in their response to Covid from the onset and their medical and supportive personnel displayed their outstanding skills, fortitude, and temperament to save and impact lives. So, what defines a health care hero? Read on to see what these outstanding institutions and their top-notch staff have in common.\nHealth care heroes agree that fighting Covid-19 requires a teamwork approach not only for the health of their patients but to support one another emotionally.\nBEST MATERNITY WARD\nStony Brook University Hospital Preserves Joy And Wonderment of Childbirth\nExpectant mothers arrive at Stony Brook University Hospital maternity ward surrounded by a caring and highly skilled staff of health care professionals who feel uniquely privileged to experience the miracle of childbirth with families.\nThe hospital has all private rooms and mothers and babies remain together as much as possible. Patients arriving at the hospital are tested for Covid-19. Covid-19 positive patients are cared for in negative pressure rooms in labor and delivery and staff closely monitor for signs and symptoms.\nShavon Bailey, RN.

She recently talked about the benefits of expectant moms being able to have the company of a support person to stay with them throughout their birth experience, along with a doula if they want, for labor and delivery.\nStony Brook did a great job because the moms were allowed to designate someone to come with them to the hospital and stay the entire time. We were great to be able to do that for our patients, said Schuette in a phone interview.\nOver the past year, some patients had Covid-19 but were asymptomatic and others were scared to get sick or have their babies get sick, she related.\nIts different than before because you never know who is sick so you want to be careful around everyone. In the beginning, we didnt know how it was affecting moms and babies and we could only go by what we were hearing from the CDC. It was scary for the patients. A new mom just wants to protect her baby and is nervous something will happen to their baby but they know we are doing our best.\nElena Lecrichia, RN sits with her husband and newborn daughter Taylor. Photo Credit: Stony Brook University Hospital\nTo assuage concerns among the expectant mothers she tries to educate them with information available from the CDC and hospital protocol to keep them safe.\nAccording to Schuette, apart from the safety measures and donning the PPE for deliveries new moms enjoy the same joyous experience at Stonybrook.\nShe feels privileged to do the kind of work she does. Its one of the most rewarding things. You get to be a part of such an instant moment in peoples lives. You are there the first time they get to hear their baby cry. Its incredible. Some [women] dont think they can get through [labor] and they do.\nShavon Bailey is also a nurse in antepartum, labor and delivery, newborn nurse, and postpartum. She talked about helping the mothers feel safe both before and during their stay at the hospital.\nSome are nervous about getting sick. We do our best from answering calls ahead of time and comfort them when they walk in the door.  We listen to their concerns and answer questions, letting them know we are doing our best. Were all good at comforting this way because this is our specialty.\nBailey was one of the nurses at the hospitals first Covid -19 C-section of a mom who was in the ICU, she related. The mom was well and the baby was well and didnt have Covid. We had great leaders that came up with the procedures and we practiced. It looked different with all the PPE and safety but it went very well.\nAshley Schuette, RN in personal protective equipment.

My coworkers are capable of empathy and it gave me a personal edge to the experience, she recounted.\nShe was seven months pregnant when news of Covid-19 hit.\nIn the beginning, she said there was general fear among herself and co-workers when like the rest of the world news of Covid-19 and how contagious it was began coming.\nIt started off slow. There definitely was some fear. Wed hear about it a little bit then there were more and more patients coming in with Covid and you knew this is serious. This is contagious and no one wanted to bring that home to their family, she recounted.\nLecrichia back then being pregnant added some concern for her at work. We didnt know if it would transmit to the baby. The fear was the unknown. It was hard, Lecrichia said.\nBut she pushed through, and in fact, worked up until the day before her baby was born. Her coworkers were supportive. We always wore the PPE and I always felt safe.  And they took the assignments that were riskier, the patients with Covid.\nNurse Elena Lecrichias newborn daughter Taylor rests in her bassinet. Photo Credit: Stony Brook University Hospital\nShe agrees the best way to ease any concerns for pregnant women arriving to have their babies is through education and communication. We work hard to normalize the process.  Even though its during a pandemic and theres more PPE for you its still going to be a loving experience, said Lecrichia.\nThe new moms shes seen coming through the doors are resilient. They are amazing and can adapt to anything.  Im really impressed with our community of moms. Even though the world may look a little chaotic, its still a time to celebrate happy moments.\nBEST MEDICAL TRANSPORTATION COMPANY\nMedford Volunteer Ambulance Brings Pre-Hospital Care, Comfort To Patients In Pandemic\nMedford Volunteer Ambulance EMTs rely on teamwork and each other to answer the publics call in the crisis  bringing emergency care and comfort in pre-hospital transport  making sure each patient has the best chance for recovery.\nVolunteer EMT Justin Zimmerman credits a close-knit group among the volunteers who get each other through",

I think it was a year in October that I first reached out, Fausey said. Over the course of this past year, weve built our standard out using our current training platform through Care Academy.\nThe program equates to 144 hours of class time and 2,000 hours of working time over a year, where individuals obtain paid work experience in home care, classroom instruction and an Advanced Home Health Aide certification. That certification can be used in any state.\nBy using the Care Academy training of Home Helpers, in conjunction with the national quality standard of the apprenticeship program and the location of local Home Helpers, a well-rounded experience for program participants is provided.\nFausey explained that amid the pandemic, Home Helpers moved into a building that once served as a home, which provides spaces to learn, in applicable settings, things like washing dishes or using a shower bench.\nThis home has opened up that world of opportunity, too. All that kind of came together, Fausey said.\nThe apprenticeship program also provides opportunities to younger individuals who may express interest in entering the home health care field. The program is open to anyone 16 years old and older.\nWe are at a point in our country where we need more caregivers, Fausey said. We need more hands-on folks working, and this program opens it up to even a young person, so they can come in. Theyll work alongside someone else until theyre 18, but it gives them the opportunity to see if this is the career path they may want to choose.\nShe paused and added the program may also help someone realize he or she doesnt want to work in home health care.\nWhy not know it when youre 17?

        "utterance": "In this June 6, 2017, file photo, a reporter holds up an example of the amount of fentanyl that can be deadly after a news conference about deaths from fentanyl exposure, at DEA Headquarters in Arlington, Va.\nCredit: Jacquelyn Martin / AP\nRare drugs designed to mimic the opioid fentanyl are showing up more often in urine samples from Penobscot County than any other county in the nation, according to a recent study. The findings are concerning to the authors, they said, since they come at a time when the fentanyl analogs are frequently being added to methamphetamine, creating a deadly combination.\nIn the study published in the Drug and Alcohol Dependence journal, the authors analyzed 300,000 urine drug tests from July 15, 2019, through March 12, 2020. Health professionals from all 50 states submitted urine samples to Millennium Health LLC, a commercial laboratory based in San Diego, to have them tested as part of patients routine care. The vast majority  295,647  had not been prescribed fentanyl for medical purposes.\nThe studys authors, who are all employees of Millennium Health, found that, of those patients testing positive for fentanyl without a fentanyl prescription, 40.55 percent had at least one fentanyl analog detected in their system, showing that copycat fentanyl is absolutely infiltrating the market for illicit substances, said Joseph Stanton, associate director of clinical affairs at Millennium Health and one of the studys authors.\nFentanyl analogs are usually produced in clandestine laboratories and, while they are chemically similar to fentanyl, they were specifically engineered to skirt U.S. law though the U.S. later banned them China is the principal source of fentanyl analogs, which has routed the drugs through the mail and Mexico, according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.\nSome drug dealers mix fentanyl analogs with other drugs, such as heroin, cocaine and methamphetamine. Mixing is cheaper for dealers because it takes only a small amount of a fentanyl analog to produce a high. However, its far riskier for users who dont always know what they are getting, evidenced by the fact that, in Maine, the average drug overdose death in 2019 involved three drugs Different analogs have different potencies, and they are not all well understood or well studied.\nOne well-known analog, however, is carfentanil, which, at 100 times the potency of fentanyl, was originally designed to sedate large animals such as elephants and moose. About 20 microgramsof carfentanil, which is less than a grain of salt, is enough to kill someone.\nOf the no-prescription, fentanyl-positive urine samples in the study, the counties that saw the highest positivity rates for more frequently found analogs such as carfentanil and acetyl fentanyl were in Kentucky and Ohio.\nBut the greatest percentage of urine samples showing traces of the least frequently found fentanyl analogs came from residents living in Penobscot County. Of those Penobscot County samples, 11.36 percent tested positive for at least one of seven rare analogs, such as acryl fentanyl.\nFor Dr. Noah Nesin, chief medical officer for Penobscot Community Health Care in Bangor, the data was startling. To have Penobscot County at the top of the list is distressing and a possible explanation as to why our overdose rates remain higher than the rest of the state, he said. PCHC does not send samples to Millennium Health.\nIn its other studies, Millennium Health can see methamphetamine use has been growing quickly in Maine  placing the state 10th nationally for its methamphetamine positivity rate among urine samples processed by Millennium Health. Maine has the fifth highest positivity rate in the nation for fentanyl, based on the laboratorys data. And for the number of samples showing a combination of methamphetamine and fentanyl, Maine ranks sixth, said Eric Dawson, the laboratorys vice president of clinical affairs.\nCombined with the recent evidence showing a high prevalence of rare fentanyl analogs in Penobscot County, it paints a very concerning picture of the state of Maine and that county specifically as it relates to those users, said Eric Dawson, vice president of clinical affairs at Millennium Health and a study author. As you start adding these things, you add to the risk of overdose.\nNeither Dawson nor Stanton know why the rare analogs appeared in Penobscot County in the eight months prior to the pandemic.\nNeither did Marcella Sorg, director of the Rural Drug and Alcohol Research Program within the University of Maine. But the results were not a surprise to her.\nI suppose thats unusual, but Maine has had fentanyl analogs present in the population since late 2012, she said.\nIn 2017, acryl fentanyl was involved in the drug death of one person in Maine, according to  Sorgs analysisof drug-related deaths that year. Butyryl fentanyl, another lesser-found analog, helped kill two people. Cyclopropyl fentanyl killed eight. And furanyl fentanyl, which the Millennium Health study didnt detect in its review, contributed to the deaths of 32 people in Maine that year. Maine has seen a variety of fentanyl analogs show up in the overdose data since.\nDifferent analogs seem to peak at different times. Its tough to get a real sense of why that may be, Stanton, with Millennium Health, said. But the authors hope that knowing more about the ever-changing makeup of the drugs in an area will help local providers and others have more informed conversations with people who are using drugs and enhance efforts to reduce overdoses, they said.\nSorg also questioned whether the studys sample size was large enough to protect against Penobscot County rising to the top of the list by chance. It is reasonable to assume that if the lesser-known analogs are in Penobscot County, they are also elsewhere in Maine, she said. Or, its possible Millennium Health tested Penobscot County samples at a particularly troublesome time.\nThey may have just happened to hit it when a bad batch showed up in the drug supply, she said.\nDr. Mark Publicker, an addiction specialist based in Portland who uses Millennium Health, agreed that the analogs may be common throughout the state. As for Penobscot Countys ranking, that may be a function of how many providers use Millennium, which may be greater than other areas in the state, he said.\nThe study does not reveal how many samples per county Millennium Health received. Because it is a private company, it doesnt disclose specific data about its customer base, Dawson said. But the company only analyzed counties where at least 10 samples tested positive for fentanyl, and 181 counties across 30 states met that bar. The lab detected the rarer group of fentanyl analogs in 56 counties across 16 states.\nOur data is limited to samples being sent to our lab from health care practitioners. It may not reflect the general population of users, but what we see for Maine is concerning, Dawson said.\nWhat is clear to Sorg from the study is that fentanyl an",

        "utterance": "The Feds Are Coming For Delta-8 THC\nHere, I talk with Ankur Rungta, founder & CEO of C3 Industries and Brian Chavez, CEO of High Profile x Budega about the social equity landscape in Massachusetts right now, the significance of this opening and more.\nJackie Bryant: What is the significance of this being the first equity recipients to open concurrent stores at the same time? Why is that notable?\nAnkur Rungta: I think there are three points to make here. Firstly, while the stores arent technically opening concurrently, with Dorchester opening in March of 2022 and Roslindale and Roxbury to follow in the summer of 2022, they were approved concurrently. We see the significance in a few different ways.\nFirst off, Boston has been a very challenging place to get local approvals generally for cannabis. Locals are protective over their space and want to make sure theyre comfortable with whos coming in. It speaks to the community process that Brian and Jaison Chavez, our partners at High Profile x Budega, ran and the trust the community has in them.\nAnother interesting point is Boston was the first major city on the East Coast to legalize recreational cannabis. Even with New Jersey and New York coming online soon, Boston will always remain one of the most sizable, influential markets on this side of the country, so these three licenses are an extremely valuable opportunity to build a brand in a major metropolitan area.\nLastly, I would also say that we're not aware of any other social equity licensees that have gotten a series of licenses for three storefronts (the maximum permitted in Massachusetts) versus only one. Im proud of the work these guys have done to achieve that.\nJB: For people who don't live in legal states or who aren't in MA, can you speak to the difficulties of becoming licensed in the state? How is it harder for equity applicants?\nAR: In Massachusetts, specifically, it's a very long and difficult process. First, you have to get local approval for a site as well as a significant amount of community support. There is a zoning process with the city which can take one to two years or sometimes longer. During this time youre spending a lot of time and money with a lot of uncertainty because you're holding real estate. The significant financial component can become incredibly challenging and is a huge barrier to entry, especially for social equity applicants who do not have access to capital.\nBrian Chavez: Part of my and Jaisons story is that two of the properties were our uncle's properties, which allowed us to avoid some of the heavy real estate holding costs that are typically involved. We also ran the community process ourselves which resulted in a cost standpoint and accessibility, and was much easier than hiring consultants or lawyers.\nAR: Part of the rationale for partnering with us is that our team could bring some other resources to the table, in terms of both finances and expertise. You have to actually come back and build the store out, a complex process which requires designs and permitting, while at the same time holding real estate where youre initially spending money without making it. Its a long, kind of torturous process. Our partnership with the Chavez brothers has allowed us to be successful in that both parties bring assets to the table that the other might not have been able to.\nJB: Could you walk me through the current landscape of social equity, who got licenses and how, in Massachusetts?\nAR: I think generally, there's a very low level of minority and social equity ownership in the Massachusetts cannabis industry. And that's not unique to Boston, but I think Boston is actually at the forefront of changing these patterns by implementing a system that does result in more social equity ownership.\nIn Boston right now its one to one, meaning for every one social equity license, the city must issue one non-social equity license. So now you have a number of stores in Boston that are approved and on their way to opening that are social equity-owned, and we applaud the city for not only promoting social equity, but making strides in execution and bringing it to fruition.\nJB: What is something exciting or notable about the Massachusetts market that people outside of it might not know? How does C3 fit into that?\nAR: In general, there seems to be less emphasis on premium flower, and premium, top-shelf products as a whole, in Massachusetts, and the gap in that market excites us. We see a huge opportunity for our focus on high-end flower, a chance to offer the consumer something more curated and differentiated from a product quality standpoint. Of course there are retailers in Boston who carry some amazing brands and products, but were excited to work with Brian and Jaison who share the same obsession with quality and want to target that corner of the market.\nWere aiming to go the boutique route, offering our customers a curated selection of the highest- quality products on the market.\nJB: Personally, I hope bodega/corner store culture is the future of weed. What are your thoughts on that and why?\nAR: Totally. We view these three stores as very much the neighborhood stores where we're serving the community in the spirit of the local bodega, making cannabis conveniently accessible. If you live in Dorchester currently, you have to go to another part of Boston or even outside of the city to get cannabis. So this is all very much about the neighborhood and community and Brian and Jaison are very much deep in these communities.\nBC: This is not a random part of Boston - were actually from Dorchester. Dorchester is the location that we worked out with C3, but the other two are my uncle's bodegas - he has long been ingrained in these communities. These are long standing local stores where neighbors would go to buy groceries, milk, cigarettes, anything you need. Wed like to look at it as were just continuing what these stores and locations have already done for these communities, but in a new way, and providing convenient and safe access to high-quality cannabis.\nJB: Do you have anything else to add? Free space! What did I miss?\nBC: I want to not only build success for my family and for myself but also to pay it forward. I feel very blessed and fortunate to have accomplished all that I have and Im excited for the next phase of actually opening these three stores. Im already thinking about how I can pay it forward and how I can encourage other social equity entrepreneurs to be successful in this space.\nFollow me on",

        "utterance": "Save\nFor years, the company ArchVirtual has been bringing architecture into the realm of virtual reality. Now, its trying to do the same for job training, and training medical professionals in particular.\nArchVirtual recently launched a software platform called Acadicus a virtual reality tool that medical training facilities can use to teach and simulate procedures for aspiring nurses, emergency response technicians and clinicians. Two weeks after the projects launch, company co-founder Jon Brouchoud said hes already working with the UW Health Clinical Simulation Program to implement the technology there.\nWith Acadicus, you can put on a headset, and be immersed with a medical expert, Brochoud said. Youre not a static observer, a passive observer of a video. Youre engaged in the learning. Youre able to pick up instruments and follow along.\nBrouchoud said that the software could be applied to environmental job training in industries from construction to automotive repair. However, the company is primarily targeting medical training facilities for Acadicus' launch.\nSchools that buy Acadicus get a library of virtual reality training simulations. A student pops on a virtual reality headset, picks a course, and find themselves in an operating room, an examination room, an ambulance, or any one of the softwares other pre-built environments. They would be able to see the avatars of other students participating in the course, as well as that of an instructor and have access to an inventory of tools, from scalpels to valve masks, as well as interactive assets like human dummies to practice procedures on.\nFrom there, theyd be able to follow along the instructor as they walk through a medical procedure. Currently, Brouchoud said the technology is well-suited for teaching broad-stroke lessons things like establishing a sterile field on a patient, or walking through the fundamentals of emergency response. In later iterations of the software, he hopes to enable more sophisticated lessons, such as complex surgical techniques.\nBut the real innovation that sets Acadicus apart, said Brouchoud, is the ability for instructors to record themselves giving demonstrations in Acadicus.\nAn instructor literally walks in, hits record, and Acadicus records everything theyre saying, everything theyre doing, said Brouchoud. They can save that training into the library...and someone else can come in and see face-to-face this instructor talking.\nBrouchoud said this is an innovation in hands-on health care education. Up until this point, facilities have been investing in sim-labs brick-and-mortar recreations of health care environments with high-tech equipment and mannequins or acquire off-the-shelf or commissioned VR simulations that lack specificity or customizability.\nA product like Acadicus, said Brouchoud, means that a facility wouldnt have to invest millions in expensive sim-lab equipment, or commission a VR developer every time they want to make a new course in virtual reality.\nWeve realized that, if we really wanna make a difference in the industry, the time and cost and complexity has to come down, he said.\nAlthough Brouchoud and ArchVirtual have made job training software before, the new focus on Acadicus represents a pivot: Up until recently, Brouchouds and ArchVirtuals specialty had been in bringing architecture to life in VR. The company would render 3D models of basketball arenas, condos, or even Madison office buildings for either project managers or members of the public to experience firsthand.\nBrouchoud decision to focus on medical training came about after the death of his father in 2017. He said that during his dads hospitalization, he learned about the shortage of nurses and medical professionals across the country and moreover, the shortage of trainers that can lead to skills deficits among those in the health care industry.\nLearning about that skills deficit profoundly shook him, he said. He even considered leaving ArchVirtual to go to medical school himself. However, he ultimately decided to use his existing skillset in VR development to help fix the problem.\nHe also decided to name the software after the Latin name of the Saw Whet owl, the bird that his father had spent his career studying.\nBrouchoud launched the software at a medical simulation conference in San Antonio in January. He said it was met with strongly positive feedback, and that he is already working with a number of early partners on implementing the technology.\nTheres a couple of people nibbling around this from an academic perspective, said Brouchoud. I would say theres no other tool like it on the market.",

        "utterance": "In this June 6, 2017, file photo, a reporter holds up an example of the amount of fentanyl that can be deadly after a news conference about deaths from fentanyl exposure, at DEA Headquarters in Arlington, Va.\nCredit: Jacquelyn Martin / AP\nRare drugs designed to mimic the opioid fentanyl are showing up more often in urine samples from Penobscot County than any other county in the nation, according to a recent study. The findings are concerning to the authors, they said, since they come at a time when the fentanyl analogs are frequently being added to methamphetamine, creating a deadly combination.\nIn the study published in the Drug and Alcohol Dependence journal, the authors analyzed 300,000 urine drug tests from July 15, 2019, through March 12, 2020. Health professionals from all 50 states submitted urine samples to Millennium Health LLC, a commercial laboratory based in San Diego, to have them tested as part of patients routine care. The vast majority  295,647  had not been prescribed fentanyl for medical purposes.\nThe studys authors, who are all employees of Millennium Health, found that, of those patients testing positive for fentanyl without a fentanyl prescription, 40.55 percent had at least one fentanyl analog detected in their system, showing that copycat fentanyl is absolutely infiltrating the market for illicit substances, said Joseph Stanton, associate director of clinical affairs at Millennium Health and one of the studys authors.\nFentanyl analogs are usually produced in clandestine laboratories and, while they are chemically similar to fentanyl, they were specifically engineered to skirt U.S. law though the U.S. later banned them China is the principal source of fentanyl analogs, which has routed the drugs through the mail and Mexico, according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.\nSome drug dealers mix fentanyl analogs with other drugs, such as heroin, cocaine and methamphetamine. Mixing is cheaper for dealers because it takes only a small amount of a fentanyl analog to produce a high. However, its far riskier for users who dont always know what they are getting, evidenced by the fact that, in Maine, the average drug overdose death in 2019 involved three drugs Different analogs have different potencies, and they are not all well understood or well studied.\nOne well-known analog, however, is carfentanil, which, at 100 times the potency of fentanyl, was originally designed to sedate large animals such as elephants and moose. About 20 microgramsof carfentanil, which is less than a grain of salt, is enough to kill someone.\nOf the no-prescription, fentanyl-positive urine samples in the study, the counties that saw the highest positivity rates for more frequently found analogs such as carfentanil and acetyl fentanyl were in Kentucky and Ohio.\nBut the greatest percentage of urine samples showing traces of the least frequently found fentanyl analogs came from residents living in Penobscot County. Of those Penobscot County samples, 11.36 percent tested positive for at least one of seven rare analogs, such as acryl fentanyl.\nFor Dr. Noah Nesin, chief medical officer for Penobscot Community Health Care in Bangor, the data was startling. To have Penobscot County at the top of the list is distressing and a possible explanation as to why our overdose rates remain higher than the rest of the state, he said. PCHC does not send samples to Millennium Health.\nIn its other studies, Millennium Health can see methamphetamine use has been growing quickly in Maine  placing the state 10th nationally for its methamphetamine positivity rate among urine samples processed by Millennium Health. Maine has the fifth highest positivity rate in the nation for fentanyl, based on the laboratorys data. And for the number of samples showing a combination of methamphetamine and fentanyl, Maine ranks sixth, said Eric Dawson, the laboratorys vice president of clinical affairs.\nCombined with the recent evidence showing a high prevalence of rare fentanyl analogs in Penobscot County, it paints a very concerning picture of the state of Maine and that county specifically as it relates to those users, said Eric Dawson, vice president of clinical affairs at Millennium Health and a study author. As you start adding these things, you add to the risk of overdose.\nNeither Dawson nor Stanton know why the rare analogs appeared in Penobscot County in the eight months prior to the pandemic.\nNeither did Marcella Sorg, director of the Rural Drug and Alcohol Research Program within the University of Maine. But the results were not a surprise to her.\nI suppose thats unusual, but Maine has had fentanyl analogs present in the population since late 2012, she said.\nIn 2017, acryl fentanyl was involved in the drug death of one person in Maine, according to  Sorgs analysisof drug-related deaths that year. Butyryl fentanyl, another lesser-found analog, helped kill two people. Cyclopropyl fentanyl killed eight. And furanyl fentanyl, which the Millennium Health study didnt detect in its review, contributed to the deaths of 32 people in Maine that year. Maine has seen a variety of fentanyl analogs show up in the overdose data since.\nDifferent analogs seem to peak at different times. Its tough to get a real sense of why that may be, Stanton, with Millennium Health, said. But the authors hope that knowing more about the ever-changing makeup of the drugs in an area will help local providers and others have more informed conversations with people who are using drugs and enhance efforts to reduce overdoses, they said.\nSorg also questioned whether the studys sample size was large enough to protect against Penobscot County rising to the top of the list by chance. It is reasonable to assume that if the lesser-known analogs are in Penobscot County, they are also elsewhere in Maine, she said. Or, its possible Millennium Health tested Penobscot County samples at a particularly troublesome time.\nThey may have just happened to hit it when a bad batch showed up in the drug supply, she said.\nDr. Mark Publicker, an addiction specialist based in Portland who uses Millennium Health, agreed that the analogs may be common throughout the state. As for Penobscot Countys ranking, that may be a function of how many providers use Millennium, which may be greater than other areas in the state, he said.\nThe study does not reveal how many samples per county Millennium Health received. Because it is a private company, it doesnt disclose specific data about its customer base, Dawson said. But the company only analyzed counties where at least 10 samples tested positive for fentanyl, and 181 counties across 30 states met that bar. The lab detected the rarer group of fentanyl analogs in 56 counties across 16 states.\nOur data is limited to samples being sent to our lab from health care practitioners. It may not reflect the general population of users, but what we see for Maine is concerning, Dawson said.\nWhat is clear to Sorg from the study is that fentanyl an",

        "utterance": "Singapore biotech firm Tychan starts final phase of Covid-19 antibody drug trials\nFriday, 11 Dec 2020 04:20 PM MYT\nThe team of researchers at Tychan, the biotech company that developed the antibody drug.  TODAY pic\nSINGAPORE, Dec 11  The Singapore-based biotechnology company Tychan hasstarted the third and final phase of its clinical trials on an antibody drug for patients with Covid-19 after it received the nod from the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) in October.\nThe trials, which began today, will involve 1,305 volunteers. The company is in the process of recruiting trial candidates.\nTrials for the drug, known as TY027, will be done at the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) and National University Hospital (NUH). Patients may also check if they are suitable for the trials at Changi General Hospital and Sengkang General Hospital. If so, they will be referred to SGH or NUH.\nOwing to the low incidence of the coronavirus in Singapore, the trials will also involve hospitals overseas, such as Israels Sheba Medical Centre.\nTY027 is being explored as a treatment forpatients with Covid-19 to slow the progression of the disease and speed up recovery. It could also provide temporary protection against infection from SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19.\nInfectious diseases expert Ooi Eng Eong, who co-founded Tychan, told reporters in a video conference today that the firm had chosen Israel as a partner because the country allows it to carry out studies in a similar fashion asSingapore.\nIsrael is also not overwhelmed by the pandemic and has the capacity to conduct the trials.\nIsrael has recorded more than 352,000 Covid-19 cases and 2,960deaths.\nProfessor Ooi, who is also deputy director of Duke-NUS Medical Schools emerging infectious diseases programme, was unable to reveal the other countries Tychan is in talks with because of a non-disclosure agreement.\nOn why Tychan has to tie up with other countries to conduct the trials, Prof Ooi said that Singapore has been successful in containing Covid-19 and, thus, there are not enough suitable candidates.\nCandidates for the trial must be Covid-19 patients within the first six days of illness.\nThe lack of suitable trial volunteers in Singapore is also why Tychan had delayed moving into the third phase of clinical trials, even though media reports previously quoted Prof Ooi saying they were slated to start in August.\nTY027 has been in development since February 25. It is a partnership between Tychan and a stable of government departments, including the Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Health and Economic Development Board.\nIn June, it entered the first phase of human trials, which involved 23 volunteers.\nProf Ooi said the Phase One trial went very well and the antibodies were so safe, with no serious adverse effects, that researchers increased the dosage from 20mg per kg to 30mg per kg.\nThe decision was made to give ourselves the best chance of eliciting a quick antiviral effect.\nHe added that researchers debated among themselves on whether to move to Phase Two trials  this phase would only further test whether the drug is safe. A decision was made to skip to Phase Three.\nPhase Two is not powered to address efficacy you cannot conclude that a drug works, only that it is safe and has a chance of working, he said. In this time of pandemic, and with all the uncertainty, we might as well go to the direct answer (in Phase Three).\nThe results of Phase Three trials will hinge on how quickly Tychan can recruit volunteers.\nVaccines alone not enough\nWhen asked how the antibody drug differs from a vaccine, Prof Ooi said that a vaccine alone would not get rid of Covid-19.\nFor example, he noted that the protection a vaccine offers against the disease is about 95 per cent. That means there is still a chance for vaccinated individuals to contract the virus.\nFurthermore, vaccination may not be suitable for patients undergoing cancer treatment or those with a history of allergies.\nMoreover, we do not know how long the protection from vaccines will last. At some point, as the vaccine immunity wanes, there is a chance that Covid-19 could reappear, he said.\nIt is thus important to have both forms of treatment.\nAn antibody drug will allow those unable to be vaccinated to be protected in some way, said Prof Ooi.\nHe does not foresee issues mass-producing TY027, as the technology for such production of antibody drugs is mature, compared with new vaccine production.\nTo really tackle this problem of a re-emergence of a Covid-19 epidemic... having treatment (with antibody drugs) for Covid-19 that really drives the virus load down, so that we do not get severe disease, is still important to prevent our healthcare system from being choked up with severe cases.

In the six-page letter, state officials blasted the day care for its employees' failure to immediately report suspected child abuse as required by law.\n\"We were surprised to receive this notice today because we had been working with licensing to address the violations,\" said Bridget Perry, a spokeswoman for Bright Horizons Children's Centers LLC, which operates the day care.\nAn Indiana day care inspector cited Children's Choice for 23 violationslast month, including failing to tell authorities about suspected child abuse, sharing knowledge of suspected abuse with other employees and failing to follow the day care's own policies, state inspection records show. FSSA was first notified about the allegations by the Indiana Department of Child Services, not by the day care.\nFormer day care employee Ali Al-Awadi, 20, Indianapolis,\nwas charged last month with felony child molesting\nin a case involving a 4-year-old girl at Children's Choice Learning Center, which is at St. Vincent Indianapolis Hospital, Marion Superior Court records show.\nThe girl told other caregivers at the day care that \"Mr. Ali\" had put his finger inside her during nap time, but they didn't report the girl's accusation to authorities until nearly 20 hours later, court records show.\nPerry said the day care already had implemented a corrective action plan to ensure it is in full compliance with state law. She said the company plans to appeal the state's license revocation.\n\"Our new center leadership team intends to continue working closely with them to reverse this decision,\" Perry said.\nBefore the state's action, Children's Choice Learning Center had been listed as a level three in Paths to Quality, the second-highest level in a rating system used by the state to help parents identify quality child care programs.\nThe day care can remain open during its appeal.\nCall Star reporter Marisa Kwiatkowski at (317) 444-6135.

Its Zingre and Associates from Ft. Scott and  we are in the midst of designing the new facility.\nWe only have a two-year lease for our current space which Mercy clearly indicated is not renewable, Postai said. We knew from the beginning that we would have to build a new clinic, which weve shared publically to the various groups weve talked with, including the city and county. To help make our startup affordable in Ft. Scott and give us time to plan, Mercy discounted the rent amount for us and  everyone in there, which is greatly appreciated.\nOverhead (electricity, gas, etc.) is extremely expensive in the existing space, as is ongoing maintenance on the building, Postai said.  So there is no way we could assume the financial burden of a 177,000 sq. ft. building that is only being minimally utilized. Others who have evaluated ownership of the building came to the same conclusion. We know Mercy recognizes that and have evaluated options including demolition although, to my knowledge, no final decision has been reached.\nCHC/SEK is planning on expanding its services to include dental care, mental health care, a womens center, more accessible pharmacy, etc. which cant be accomplished in the existing space we now occupy without a major investment in renovation in a building with a uncertain future, Postai said.  Our model of care also supports integration of services. For example, children coming in for their well child check may also have a visit with the dentist or someone struggling to manage their diabetes may meet with a therapist or a patient educator as part of their medical visit. Numerous support staff also coordinate care or work with special populations (e.g. expectant mothers)  which requires space within the clinic. So, were working with our Ft. Scott staff to determine what they want and need in a new building built specifically to support our one-stop approach or, as our vision says, Healthcare The Way It Should Be.'\n\nIn addition, CHC/SEK also  will assume responsibility of Mercys clinic in Columbus in January 2020, Postai said.\n We will be combining our existing Columbus clinic with Mercys clinic,  Postai said.  Mercy will continue to manage the hospital in Columbus which is owned by the city.\nPostai said CHC/SEK is also extending its reach into Oklahoma.\nCHC/SEK was one of 77 health centers in the U.S. to receive grants to open new health centers and we will be doing so in Miami and Wyandotte, Oklahoma, she said.  Our center in Miami is currently operated by Mercy who asked us if we would assume responsibility and we agreed to do so. The one in Wyandotte is in a school and will primarily serve the students, their families and school staff. We will have the clinics open before the end of the year.\n\nThe organization is also working to secure future doctors for the area, and former Mercy Hospital CEO Reta Baker was selected to administer the program to do just that.\nReta Baker is now CHC/SEKs Vice President of Clinical Education, with the office located in Pittsburg.\nWe also are working with the University of Kansas School of Medicine to establish a family practice residency program in southeast Kansas, Postai said. To provide administrative oversight of this program  and all of our clinical education students  is Reta Baker, former hospital CEO in Ft. Scott. She has been named VP/Clinical Education and her office is located in CHC/SEKs system office in Pittsburg.\nWith all the outreach activity of CHC/SEK, We are nearing 500 full-time employees, Postai said.\nHere is the list of CHS/SEK outreach from Krista Postai:\nCrawford County:  Our main clinic in Pittsburg plus a dental-only clinic downtown and we just opened a school-based health center in Pittsburg High School.

        "utterance": "Updated Oct. 17\nKrista Postai\nKrista Postai, President and CEO of Community Health Center of Southeast Kansas, said they expanding services.\nMercy Hospital announced in October 2018 that they would be closing December 2018.\nCommunity Health Center of Southeast Kansas, 401 Woodland Hills Blvd.\nCHC/SEK then assumed responsibilities, securing physicians and staff to provide a clinic to the community at the Mercy Hospital site, 401 Woodland Hills Blvd.\nThe CHC/SEK is currently planning to build a new facility on the Horton Street side of the former Mercy Hospital site.\nCHC/SEK will be building a facility on Horton, just west of the former Mercy Hospital building.\nWe have selected an architect for our new Fort Scott clinic, Postai said. Its Zingre and Associates from Ft. Scott and we are in the midst of designing the new facility.\nWe only have a two-year lease for our current space which Mercy clearly indicated is not renewable, Postai said. We knew from the beginning that we would have to build a new clinic, which weve shared publically to the various groups weve talked with, including the city and county. To help make our startup affordable in Ft. Scott and give us time to plan, Mercy discounted the rent amount for us and everyone in there, which is greatly appreciated.\nOverhead (electricity, gas, etc.) is extremely expensive in the existing space, as is ongoing maintenance on the building, Postai said. So there is no way we could assume the financial burden of a 177,000 sq. ft. building that is only being minimally utilized. Others who have evaluated ownership of the building came to the same conclusion. We know Mercy recognizes that and have evaluated options including demolition although, to my knowledge, no final decision has been reached.\nCHC/SEK is planning on expanding its services to include dental care, mental health care, a womens center, more accessible pharmacy, etc. which cant be accomplished in the existing space we now occupy without a major investment in renovation in a building with a uncertain future, Postai said. Our model of care also supports integration of services. For example, children coming in for their well child check may also have a visit with the dentist or someone struggling to manage their diabetes may meet with a therapist or a patient educator as part of their medical visit. Numerous support staff also coordinate care or work with special populations (e.g. expectant mothers) which requires space within the clinic. So, were working with our Ft. Scott staff to determine what they want and need in a new building built specifically to support our one-stop approach or, as our vision says, Healthcare The Way It Should Be.'\nIn addition, CHC/SEK also will assume responsibility of Mercys clinic in Columbus in January 2020, Postai said.\nWe will be combining our existing Columbus clinic with Mercys clinic, Postai said. Mercy will continue to manage the hospital in Columbus which is owned by the city.\nPostai said CHC/SEK is also extending its reach into Oklahoma.\nCHC/SEK was one of 77 health centers in the U.S. to receive grants to open new health centers and we will be doing so in Miami and Wyandotte, Oklahoma, she said. Our center in Miami is currently operated by Mercy who asked us if we would assume responsibility and we agreed to do so. The one in Wyandotte is in a school and will primarily serve the students, their families and school staff. We will have the clinics open before the end of the year.\nThe organization is also working to secure future doctors for the area, and former Mercy Hospital CEO Reta Baker was selected to administer the program to do just that.\nReta Baker is now CHC/SEKs Vice President of Clinical Education, with the office located in Pittsburg.\nWe also are working with the University of Kansas School of Medicine to establish a family practice residency program in southeast Kansas, Postai said. To provide administrative oversight of this program and all of our clinical education students is Reta Baker, former hospital CEO in Ft. Scott. She has been named VP/Clinical Education and her office is located in CHC/SEKs system office in Pittsburg.\nWith all the outreach activity of CHC/SEK, We are nearing 500 full-time employees, Postai said.\nHere is the list of CHS/SEK outreach from Krista Postai:\nCrawford County: Our main clinic in Pittsburg plus a dental-only clinic downtown and we just opened a school-based health center in Pittsburg High School. A mobile medical van goes daily to the middle school and elementary schools. We also have the clinic in Arma.\nCherokee County we have a clinic in Baxter Springs and Columbus.\nBourbon County we have Walk-in Care and the main Ft. Scott clinic.\nLinn County we have clinics in Mound City and Pleasanton.\nLabette County we have a clinic in Parsons.\nMontgomery County we have a clinic in Independence and three in Coffeyville a main clinic, one in the elementary school and one in the middle/high school.\nAllen County we have a clinic in Iola.\nWe will be opening two clinics in Ottawa County, OK in December one in Miami and one in the Wyandotte Schools.\nWe also employ nurses in multiple schools, as well as behavioral health specialists throughout the region.\nCHCSEK offices are located at 3011 N. Michigan, Pittsburg, KS 66762. The phone number is 620-235-1867.\nThe CHC/SEK Clinic in Fort Scotts number is 223-8040.\nShare this:",

        "utterance": "Case studies\nA project that involves keeping a close eye on the health of care home residents has been extended for a year after a trial showed impressive results.\nThe Docobo telehealth project was initially piloted for six months in two care homes in Maidstone, Kent. In the first three months, it resulted in a 32 per cent reduction in hospital admissions, a 25 per cent reduction in 999 calls, a 67 per cent reduction in 111 calls and a 44 per cent reduction in all GP contact.\nAs a result of this success, it is now running in four care homes, with three of the homes in Maidstone and one in Tonbridge. The project was paused during the first wave of COVID-19, but resumed and extended in September (2020).\nUsing a Docobo telehealth solution, staff at the care homes carry out simple health checks with residents each day and record these via a Docobo app.\nThis system is closely monitored by the Complex Care Team at Kent Community Health NHS Foundation Trust (KCHFT) which can instantly see if a residents health is stable or deteriorating. The team can then immediately step in with the most appropriate action, which might be as simple as carrying out increased observations to monitor a patient more closely, or tweaking a patients medication.\nKCHFT Project Manager Andy Platt said: We extended the project because the clinical team at KCHFT and staff at the first two care homes established an excellent relationship and a new way of working, which resulted in improved outcomes for the care home residents.\nThe result from the trial showed a clear reduction in unplanned hospital admissions and contact with emergency care services, which is vital for these key NHS services, and we expect the level of reductions we are seeing will remain the same, as the number of care homes we support increases.\nTogether with the excellent results we have achieved, its also important to realise how using this is benefitting care home residents. Their health is being closely monitored and any deterioration in their health is detected much quicker than before, resulting in spending less time with GPs and in hospital and more time feeling comfortable in their homes. A visit to A&E can be stressful and unsettling.\nThe project has seen KCHFT and care home staff monitoring residents with long-term conditions, such as heart failure, diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The care home staff do simple healthcare checks with residents each day and ask condition specific questions, such as have they felt dizzy, short of breath or more tired than normal. They record this information using the Docobo app, which is installed on a tablet.\nAndy said: The Complex Care Team at KCHFT closely monitors the data trends and will quickly detect if a residents health is deteriorating. We have set up parameters for each patient and if their observations fall outside of these, an alert is sent to the on duty complex care nurse who would then respond to the alert.\nThe project is reducing pressures on urgent care services. It also means the Complex Care Team can focus on the patients who urgently need the specialist care that they provide.\nThe care homes we worked with during the trial were very positive about this project and said it has resulted in their staff becoming more confident in looking after residents and carrying out basic observation checks, including blood pressure and temperature. It has helped improve their knowledge and skills.\nAndy has worked on the project with colleagues Steph Rhodes, Head of Long Term Services and Lauren Warburton, Operational Manager west Kent. It has been overseen by KCHFT Medical Director Sarah Phillips.\nThe care homes involved in the project are The Oast, Chippendayle Lodge and Eastfields, in Maidstone and Chestnut Lodge, Tonbridge.\nAndy ran a quality improvement (QI) project to help with the introduction of Docobo at the care homes. He aimed to reduce hospital admissions, calls to 999 and GP visits, each by 10 per cent, but far surpassed this initial target. One QI tool Andy used was a driver diagram, to help establish what action was needed to make an improvement.\nAdrian Flowerday, Managing Director and Co-founder of Docobo, said: Its brilliant to see the real benefits of remote monitoring for care home residents and the fantastic stats speak for themselves.\nDocobo has been working in Kent for some years now and the quality improvement route taken to develop the new way of working in care homes is something weve been happy to support the excellent team at Kent with. The great results are a combination of the people, process and technology coming together, so Id like to personally thank the staff at KCHFT and the care homes for the amazing outcomes, and the fact that it helps so much during the pandemic and lockdown, is great.

It also means the Complex Care Team can focus on the patients who urgently need the specialist care that they provide.\nThe care homes we worked with during the trial were very positive about this project and said it has resulted in their staff becoming more confident in looking after residents and carrying out basic observation checks, including blood pressure and temperature. It has helped improve their knowledge and skills.\nAndy has worked on the project with colleagues Steph Rhodes, Head of Long Term Services and Lauren Warburton, Operational Manager west Kent. It has been overseen by KCHFT Medical Director Sarah Phillips.\nThe care homes involved in the project are The Oast, Chippendayle Lodge and Eastfields, in Maidstone and Chestnut Lodge, Tonbridge.\nAndy ran a quality improvement (QI) project to help with the introduction of Docobo at the care homes. He aimed to reduce hospital admissions, calls to 999 and GP visits, each by 10 per cent, but far surpassed this initial target.\nAdrian Flowerday, Managing Director and Co-founder of Docobo, said: Its brilliant to see the real benefits of remote monitoring for care home residents and the fantastic stats speak for themselves.\nDocobo has been working in Kent for some years now and the quality improvement route taken to develop the new way of working in care homes is something weve been happy to support the excellent team at Kent with. The great results are a combination of the people, process and technology coming together, so Id like to personally thank the staff at KCHFT and the care homes for the amazing outcomes, and the fact that it helps so much during the pandemic and lockdown, is great.",

But who knows?\nAlthough Harry made two trips to London this past year, Meghan did not accompany her husband since she was expecting daughter Lilibet.\nThe Games were founded by Harry himself to support sick and injured military personnel.\nInvictus Games are is scheduled to take place between May 29 and June 5.\nMore From Entertainment:",
